through rapture purpose photos and story , a national geographic exploration of by wade davis celebrate the aboriginal culture extraordinary biodiversity , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are all born into 母腹 and in the world 生儿育女 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl , sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 and so we &apos;re going to sing and dance in 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture song rhythm and dance rhythm , has unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different mind makes you want to see . 
the world 五彩缤纷 culture 犹如 a by mental life and culture life intertwined and into the internet cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is the human race circle the great heritage . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also , as we have a strong , the ability to look at the species . 
as biosphere by severe around the same race circles are facing the same shorter and its destruction faster 
this one of the most important is that language . 
in our lives on this planet that would have 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is shining human spirit . 
it &apos;s the unique culture mental actually in the material world 承 carrier . 
every a language is a mind a conscious and a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know that the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we in the audience numbers as much in the language of half no longer to teach kids 
these language has no 传人 that unless we valid solutions , they will be completely gone . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you just last say 本族语 . people can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
another spooky is actually , on the planet , about every two weeks , you &apos;re going to have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or is 科基语 
and you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race about race loop loop to give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people have forgot the front , and i said “ survival ” in front of a different way , i said “ different ” survival . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 northwest part of the played methuselah -- they &apos;re called 蚺 that the race because they believe in a time , they come from 米尔克 river 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green because forest is their 栖身 , so the in their opinion 天穹 with the forest canopy , and no difference . 
they say , with a weird language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that called linguistics 异族 通婚 one to the people with a different languages , married people . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . a 大家族 often have 六七种 language you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i &apos;ve been exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had peace friendly . 
five missionary 1957 years to approach them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they from the sky and leave eight to 10 十张 they himself in the picture , we think it &apos;s kind of that , but they don &apos;t think of this living in 雨林中 who &apos;ve never seen a two-dimensional . 
from the forest , they pick up these pictures , and then take photographs get over to try to find these people , the person , but they nothing , and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 dead that five evangelist . 
more terror is not only 戮 华拉尼 at people died . 
and they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is death by their own people 戮 . 
we &apos;re 一个八代 宗谱 to survey found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , out of the same people 年迈 more work is going to wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , to the forest , they have astonishing 惊诧 perspective . 
their predator can smell 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teaching is not a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s very interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam buddhist and other things that religion . 
voodoo the unique about it is in life , and the connection between . 
born in a soul . 
the dance with the rhythm of 翩翩起舞 can to 大水 below the soul just replace the birth of the soul in this brief moment 侍僧成 shining for god . 
so voodoo believers , like to say , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re in the temple dance to be . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
in my exposed to all of those groups of living in colombia in the mountains of santa 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization descent , they were once conquered and takes over the columbia of the coast in plain 此后 they go back to the caribbean , on the plains of an isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent that race was never hispanic conquered . 
and to today , they ran 续 the monk to govern institutions , but they monk 训诫 very unique 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values , these values that maintain the relationship between the believers in the universe , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful that you need to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 call us for 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to learn , very important . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 wouldn &apos;t tolerate 思乡 of torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
the important is that this symbol meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia , grew up with the local people thought that i think is going to affect forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll see that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this is a picture i this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often use it to make -- dead on water psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain five -- 羟 color is the 成份 very close . 
亚诺马 rice tribe , people are from with five 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you use a nose sucked into the powder , you &apos;ll see 光怪陆离 hallucinations in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distorted , but were totally wiped out 
but the color is matter that doesn &apos;t oral because they &apos;re going to be human organ in a called a single is 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have to change and oral alone is 氧化酶 living as other chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that this kind of 藤本植物 there β -- 咔 啉 right to be able to control one is 氧化酶 and play is the potency of color , so you 不由得 to ask myself . 
we , ordinary people will do all kinds of experiments , keep making errors and measure . 
but if you ask indians , they &apos;ll say plants to speak . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is all they &apos;re in deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask , how are they gave these plants hierarchy , they said , &quot; i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not for plants have to know what i say , is not 
and i tell you they say , if you &apos;re in months circle of the night in the things that grow every plant to use the different little word to you sing . 
and this discovery is not going to let you get at harvard university ph.d. , but it &apos;s much more accounting 报表 is more fun . 
now . we have this question , and some of us compassion indigenous tragedy think they 离群索居 丰富多彩 life , but as our world moving forward in these people go to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been threatened by new way of life , the urge shock 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is a great sioux nation indians and americans say goodbye 骑马 and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat race loop 完整性 is not change or technological innovation itself , but power is barbaria up his ideas . 
let &apos;s look at the mountains tibet recently where i do a lot of research , where you can see the political repressive brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide cultural destruction , which is destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce , in many places it even be a part of this strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
and this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese people immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family 成份 and be 关押 . 
he was still there are only two his mother 悄悄地 put him hidden dress and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended behavior , and was sent to 学习班 
one day she accidentally hit the mark of a hair &apos;s head of 臂章 and was about to take seven 劳教 guilty of countries 
the pain of tibet for people to take the human redemption mental need access to witness 
then , finally , we &apos;re going to be such a choice , we &apos;re trying to live in a single world still need to a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
think about it , we have in the world , there &apos;s a 60 10,000 year it will make you feel guilty . 
新石器 age revolution for human into the agricultural age we seed , he went to the top of the girl 腊 萨满 poetry is 祭 for the mantra take , for us to create the next level , and the 社会分工 that only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
and i think this brief history have enough that we have the ability to solve the challenges of going to be facing . 
when we tell the world of different cultures , ask the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in a song of that , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to recognize that we have to make sure that every race , and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i 巴芬岛 in the northern part of the mountain . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 whale call that the person to my tells a story about his grandfather legendary story . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign states that we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old man refused to move . 
his family fear of his security put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , which is their days alone , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 packet 冻 made out of the fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he &apos;s slept in outside wearing his seal leather 长裤 he put a stool pulled to these when stool quickly become stiff , he made it into a blades . 
and in this shit made out of the blades puke on the edge of the 口水 , and it &apos;s frozen and become very robust , he used it to 刀子 宰杀 a dog . 
剥 next dogs bark , make a pair of 挽具 his chest and take the dog sleds condom made to the other dog was down to between don &apos;t there to make it in the shit ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways . it &apos;s inuit people in the world , all indigenous life force real 写照 顽强 . 
1999 four months , the government to a area than in california , and in the area of land back to the big 之和 returned to the inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called new le dimensions , 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a very good , that a country , can make a difference to think about how to repair and its people relationship . 
and finally , i think for ever in the world , some remote people actually there is not remote 
because there &apos;s a 族类 home . 
they are the branches of human imagination , go back to the millions of times , for all of us , for these kids dreams and our kids dream is that the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think jt debate is not to convince other people , but we think , by talking about the fact that can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s good at talking about the institutions of our website , a click of up to the three of thousands of five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a country play 
we have millions of people magazine 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software that could change the way we watch digital images from the internet . use picks up a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute the magic view , and you can go all around them . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is many many gb and 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can do for and smooth zoom in , by the way you can mapping through them , you can for them to rearrange . 
see of the data , no matter how many images of , how big and images themselves , how big , seadragon all have that kind of processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot the picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a from library of congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because our system of performance , the only factor is just , you can use the screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very , very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s the data is an image . 
this is what he dickens &quot; 荒凉 山庄 , &quot; and that line is chapter of content . 
i &apos;m going to give you prove that this is really text and the images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be a reading an electronic book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 here is one of the opening . 
and the paper , or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , and people would get better reading experience , to enjoy read it . 
here we are doing a small change in this a &quot; the guardian &quot; to corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you just see the normal commercial resolution to a lot , in the picture into the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to avoid the screen actually used the area limits . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window and things like the information . 
obviously , with this technology with digital maps , of course , is one of the applications . 
so , i really don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field for your contribution . 
these are just a nasa space on the basis of geography . 
to 叠加 processing and get the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merge with two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other lady is out at the university of washington graduate noah snavely undertake computer visual research findings . the research , but we got washington university , steve seitz 
and of microsoft &apos;s rick szeliski help . it &apos;s a beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got application , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to images to multiple ways of looking at , and to do with subtlety of 剖析 and have more resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually a very significant . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make site , to take care of a lot of the problem . 
these are all from flickr photos , by doing this in space , being 串联 up . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : i mean , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this welcome . it was very happy . 
i think you can see that these images from a lot of different , the camera , from a cell phone camera into a single backwards . so a lot of different quality images , was all in this environment work together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
i remember here , there should be a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to the poster , to see the rebuilding of the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can work to use the internet community . we can get from everybody &apos;s data to everybody for different environments that memory , collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , and all the secondary out to be much more than just gather up all of them . 
this model can secondary out , is the whole planet . 
this is stephen lawler , like , &quot; virtual earth &quot; the long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
the user picture , you will be 注 the tag . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand that it &apos;s right , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the years to come from the picture 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software , the real sense , is to explore . 
it &apos;s a picture of the building up hypertext . 
this 接合 process is completely based on images of content . 
even more exciting is that image contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re on the internet is a picture , the key word later , page text will have a lot of with this picture , the relevant information . 
now , suppose that image with you a picture of it all together , that would be like ? 
at that time , so the semantic information to each other inside of links , and is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
barry 施瓦茨 : choice in the time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about the book of content hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know exactly what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a recognized the creed of going up . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 笃信 疑 principles . 
well , this is to say this : if we want to get people to get the big enough benefits , the way is to make personal free to maximize . 
and the reason is the freedom that things with itself is good and valuable , for what they need to . 
and once you have the freedom , all of us can myself 做主 with all the way the big enough to get somebody else &apos;s welfare , don &apos;t have to work for me were 做主 . 
and the freedom to make a lot to do is the big enough more selective . 
people more choices , freedom is more and more freedom , getting the benefits that the more . 
i think , the idea is like 掺 into the water in that deep-rooted that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives , yet . 
and i &apos;m going to show you some examples , and look at the social progress development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my house , near a supermarket . not very much . 
i just want to talk about this salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and then you turn out to be a one stores to it , a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box conclusion , cd machine conclusion , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a one shop three-dimensional sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
with this store components that you can have a close 650万种 all the combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , i &apos;m talking about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer to phone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , the telephone is going to die are not bad . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially cell phones . now , that cartoons . 
these are the mobile phone . 
one of my most 津津乐道 is the middle -- that will take mp three the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , it doesn &apos;t take long , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store , and you ask : is there a with so many function ? &quot; 
you want to , say , what would ? 
answer is no ” “ . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phone . 
again , in life in the other than shopping more for us to affect the things that have the same up there . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , who straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
one nail has happened and risk and so forth . 
and so forth solution 乙 have happened and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , should i do ” how ? 
the psychiatrist says , again , nail has these things and risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how are you going to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , “ , but i &apos;m not ” you . 
now the prescription drugs advertising over , it &apos;s all about the ordinary people with you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said that can &apos;t think a . if we can &apos;t go to 柜台 buy . 
why are we doing to their marketing campaign ? 
answer is , they wanted us to look at the advertising , and the next morning would go to your doctor on the phone , and they put on the prescription drugs , put in them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became choice topic . it &apos;s like this slide , trying to convince you of that . 
now we gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by ourselves to invent . 
so that we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up after you right now , you want to do a kind of the people and men and women -- make decisions . 
in marriage family ways , in the past , everybody in the age that got married , that &apos;s almost as a result , the thing , and then there &apos;s 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices are and who got married , and it &apos;s not what you see , it &apos;s not married , after what to do . 
and today , about everything that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
i teach a bunch of good and bright students , but now i give them all placed homework time less than a fifth one . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever before student -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t , then who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re thinking , are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask myself , what am i going to get married or not to marry ? is it going right now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do i all placed homework , whether they in my class to take a what grades . 
they actually have to think about this problem , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day of any time , in the earth in a corner of the work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place to wifi , but i don &apos;t tell you the where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible chose liberal bring us is we have to have choices make decisions , again , again , again , for themselves , and now the job was to break or so moved . 
we go to kid play football , a 裤兜 in with all the mobile phone , another 裤兜 in with all their blackberry and blackberry , though , the lap was a laptop . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the children in 场上 rivals for , and continue to ask myself , i still don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
back to or not , back to the email ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this was 信稿 ? 
even if you give yourself , the answer is no , you have children , and it was a ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , or a big thing , it &apos;s a small thing , matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we used to live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world , it &apos;s like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say that it &apos;s a bad beauty . 
all these choices for people have two impact , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first of all , speak a little paradox , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us is not liberating , but inside , is paralysis . 
with so many choices that people want to make that decision is very , very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a story about peer-to-peer pension plan investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to vanguard investment record . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
her research that is , when those customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you give 50种 foundation , employees to people than you provide 5种 foundation , down 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that that this is even more difficult , so you can actually put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s get tomorrow &apos;s , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to the year of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , choices , possibilities much result is numb rigid . 
and it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , and you must really want you to make that decision is the right , right ? 
and there , you definitely don &apos;t want to choose wrong a foundation , or the salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the more likely to puzzling something to feel regret . this is one of them , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make choices . 
secondly , is what economists call “ opportunity cost ” things . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice can think about it , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you gave up to attract people aspect of it . that makes you always chosen to you that think 美中不足 . 
let me give you an example -- and shows comics , but if you are not new yorker , if i have a 歉 . 
but it &apos;s you right now should think about that . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , the sun 明媚 , they have all this . 
it can be more than that okay ? this is where they &apos;re going to “ huh , really bad , ” “ is now in august , ” . 
“ manhattan , neighbors , are not home , ” 
“ i want to go back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost percent and the good parking opportunity . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let us to have to make a decision not happy , even if the decision it &apos;s actually quite 英明 . 
we have options more and more of these options , the genius of the things that the more , these things and became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
and this cartoon means for problem . 
it also say the “ in the present whatsoever ” this principle . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , one of them is it is , when you chose to do something , you and you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing that tends to have a lot to your place , and will undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and third , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time , i went to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in a more time enough , over a million times , and then pants get 凑合 . 
so , in the many years old pants , and i finally 上街 to buy the new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and said , you &apos;re 紧身 type , comfort type , was 宽松 for ? 
the front to 扣子 and pull locked ? 石磨 and acid wash ? 
to just quickly a broken ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i said , “ i &apos;m going to that used to be the only kind of ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it was even worse . 
why ? for this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is , because there are so many can choose sex , i was in a jeans what should have a much better to be good expectations greatly rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a while , i don &apos;t have much expect . 
and when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the best at least a is 极致 perfect . 
and that &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i want to do more , and i expect than up , and this one , it becomes disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for people to do what we can actually have a lot of good outside expectations didn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize and less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
and the market , there &apos;s nobody understood this when they . because if there &apos;s people understand it , you don &apos;t have to know what this is the idea . i mean it . 
it &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s a belief : in everything , terrible over all than now better . 
and the reason why is that when one of the things that are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , in our these rich , industrial civic life in the world , perfect . it &apos;s of course , for every one of the things you most only hope than you would expect , it &apos;s not bad . 
you will never be what was amazing , because you my than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so now -- i want to do it by a bit of time on to myself , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now in the store , there are hundreds of jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : are you . 
you can actually do better . 
out there with the hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t have any excuse to get things f it up . 
and it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and good , they have to decide -- is so disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world and the developed world -- clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this now to bring happiness -- the standard principles , and we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . it &apos;s not right . 
of course , there &apos;s a choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a key value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond the ‘ choice , and we actually ’ needs the critical value . 
i quickly said it . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that has so much choice , is a huge abundance of matter . 
we in the world , and there &apos;s a lot of places , at least , we heard a few of those , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so here i talk about this topic is modern western societies , on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we make the expensive and very difficult to operate the car seats 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , these big , expensive and complicated choice is not just 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really has brought us harm . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and improve practice . 
product redistribution will make all , it &apos;s not just the poor , living good , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess choice . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , the fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish in everything is ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but the more , i think are obvious that it was fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs this ” “ fish . 
in this fish -- and you know , for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means that suffering going to , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i have to talk about this project , part of the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to do from the numbers code to a biology of new phase , design and synthetic life . 
we often trying to come up with some big problems . 
what is life “ ” , i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try and in a different level to understand the problem . 
and we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now , we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , and it from a biological mimic analysis world entered the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to question , if we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world , we create new life ? 
this is a microbial sequence , here , mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it in the lab , replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 genes of 一百组 is that we separate out in front of this . 
so , we think the only thing that can continue to study way is to synthesize the chromosomes , so we can change its components to continue to ask the basic problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to build this , we never succeeded in big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a pair chromosome , by the way down , just some not live sexual of chemicals . 
our digital lives speed constantly exponentially . faster . 
we write genetic code , the ability of the progress , and very slow , but it still increasing . we recently is going to speed up to exponential curve . 
in 15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it through a couple steps . when we did the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world &apos;s 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna , length , in 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , long time , i made a mistake that the more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is the first attempt , from phi x 174 genome and bacteriophage -- digital information started . 
it &apos;s a can kill bacteria small virus . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the other people excited about this is when we put this video don &apos;t have to live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , the bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles and back to kill the e. coli and 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , and i think they have a model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this is actually the software can , in a biological system of build your own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that this digital information has to be very accurate . 
when we in 1995 , first to this group gene sequencing , right , the standard is every 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , in to sequence , the average is about 30 mistakes . and if we use to sequence , that set of genes could never have turned on . 
design part of the work , design is 50 character length of time and and other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units of the time . we need to design that they can together . 
and there we design a unique part . 
you may have heard about us in one joined 水印 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
the character of 三联 body -- and these scripts 编成 about 20 amino acids , that every amino acids , there &apos;s a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and you can use to cut enzyme 裁 . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them to put together . 
and then we started building pieces , from 7000 character length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character length of time , and then bring 几组 snippet merger , become 72 , people long time . 
in every stage , we produce a lot of the time , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very , very reliable process a minute , you &apos;ll see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece over 100 , 7,000 fundamental right , they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred rewired , biology to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there are a little radiation 球菌 microbes is able to withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on the top images in its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original form . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is a front mentioned yeast way and put it in the right after we design pieces . yeast automatically , will they aggregates . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is much of a molecule that we can use a optics microscope to look at it . 
these are , long about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than 580000 character long genetic code . this is by humans setting structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface not interval , to put the print it out . and you need 142页 to print the genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
now , obviously , with a virus , very simple process a bacterium , which is more complicated . 
with like ourselves this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome with the cells 连成 one , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to move on to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process stop there . but we try to bring this process of design , more into some . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that all had a second chromosomes species or from other parts of the third side chromosomes , in a second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution , and only going to have a genetic change the perception ignored the creation of a lot of reality . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digesting the dna . 
what cells chromosome without this enzyme without this enzyme , and when we add in a have this enzyme chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the other part of the chromosome is no matter , it &apos;s going to the digest , finally , we have a involved with the new dna . 
we put it into the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all of the original species feature all disappeared , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , in fact , is that we put into it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we really get through dna , to move to radically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of a life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to every single one of us from 1946 is people ; in the next 40 years in , would be the four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , fuel , all the very , very difficult . 
change to nine billion people that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this creature programs , or any can replace it program , it &apos;s a big challenge . 
and then , of course , is the material of indicated by the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world . that &apos;s the one that has about 两千万组 gene database , and i like to see them as the future of design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to kind of components , and look at that we can get diversity . 
now , our main limit from the biology of reality , and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can build what we call “ mix chromosomes group ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
what we have to make a big robots , the ability to allow us to create a day , the chromosomes . 
and this is just standard choice . we can start to survive ability to choose , chemistry or fuel production , the production and so on . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit at work in the computer to design species actually use the design of the software . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you see the grain recently going into ethanol , it &apos;s a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it was sugar into higher value of the fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we &apos;ve found in the world , we have a number of types . other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes , and in 1996 by them . 
it lives in the deep . about 1.5英里 deep , almost in boiling water of life . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
we &apos;re looking at is able to collect the two has really , really convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase the &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic question of understanding . 
we really have replace the oil 化工 industry , the little target . so now -- if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there are probably ? as a major energy . 
and we are using the same tool making a 几组 real-time vaccine . 
and you can see this year &apos;s flu , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is the future might present situation with change , right now , evolutionary tree , with synthetic 古物 species of bacteria , and it &apos;s a biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 ted u speak in the short , brian cox : share some of which super 对撞机 news . the content , including are now going to repair and this one in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted , i introduced the lhc . 
and i said that have come back to you do it on to the machine running . 
it is , if you &apos;re not going to last year , the lhc . is in the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
it &apos;s ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these detectors for a big bang some camera 
this is what i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started the process . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters particles , and all the way down the lhc . around like what we plan to with the lhc . some of the in a lot of particles in 辐 go flying off detectors . 
in other words , when we see that in september 10号 a scene , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know is that it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 or is this -- when people go to google , saw front page icons like this . 
this suggests that we work to the cultural shock that with the science as a shock . 
but about a week later , our machines out some sort of like these 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission they 安培 current when the machine on . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do it , because when it very low , it becomes a superconducting 导线 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between the temperature of the case of these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of a sudden they transmission 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
have to put them 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , to get that data , and then continue our mission to find out that the universe , basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , it &apos;s still with us for the fact that my itself , which is the value of at the lhc . 
thank you .

i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but the love of obsessed with my life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event , however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event that i have to rethink , and i &apos;m working relationship . 
and it turns out , and whether i where , people think this life , and that &apos;s the result is now , if i go to where people think that this is my life . 
really , just like that , completely , not saved , play 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very depression , came to me and said , “ you not afraid ? not afraid that you are not in my life beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s really going to comfort people ! 
i was around in the same question , people say , you don &apos;t of will never work ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair die , covered in a failed 苦痛 i was always get to that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know not to . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , the fear of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear of writing ? but , the fear of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear of writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? 
no one said , “ john , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ” ? 
never would happen this question . 
and of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineers that this group , not in the last few century , and addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global , not in the last few century , and addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 , around the world . 
just look at the early years of the century , in every field great creativity wizards 英年早逝 case just look at the early years of the century , in every field great creativity wizards 英年早逝 case is often age gently died of suicide 
even if they don &apos;t suicidal , often don &apos;t fully shows their talent , even though they don &apos;t suicidal , often don &apos;t fully shows their brilliance 
and the 曼梅 le , died in front of the last time interview said : “ my each one of the book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
in your life &apos;s work , this is how radical statement . 
i want to ask all of you is : you all for that no other questions ? i &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you all for that no other questions ? 
all of you think this sentiment ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断

i think , to inspire our great creative wizards to live to be more . 
and that &apos;s my own case , believed that it brings me to bring in the dark 绝境 , and i , myself , believed that it brings me to bring in the dark 绝境 , especially in my career , at the stage , especially in my career stage right now . 
you see , i was young , i came to 40 years old , you see , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for career 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say , is a friend in the heart , and it really possible , that i &apos;ve ever biggest successes is over . 
oh my god , it &apos;s kind of ideas . 
is this idea , and you &apos;re on a 大清早 drank piano wine don &apos;t understand the way , is this idea , and you &apos;re on a 大清早 drank piano wine on the road , no . i don &apos;t want to be like that . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
and after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , and i have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and i have to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance from the writing itself , and i work for responses extreme anxiety difference between the writing itself , and i work for responses extreme anxious . 
this one for the last brought me to the ancient greek and ancient rome 
so please patient , hear me , because the last will sent back to our problems . 
in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred tense elves from distant and you know where artists around here , with a remote and you know that the purpose of the distant and is , don &apos;t know where artists around here , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creative , to the djinn for “ 守护神 ” 
and people often think that , socrates that there &apos;s a 守护神 , from a distance to give him wisdom was that people often think that , socrates that there &apos;s a 守护神 , from a distance to give him . 
the roman people with the same ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ genius ” ancient rome people with the same ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this is a wonderful , because the romans didn &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal 
this idea which is fantastic , this is what i &apos;m looking at this safe distance , and that &apos;s what makes people from work 成败 impact psychological protection . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
the ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great . it can &apos;t fully to the fact that you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of “ genius ” help do work . 
if you work a terrible , and not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is westerners in the last a long time to think about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
无异 to ask him to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual for me , it &apos;s too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of the self cognitive , and for people to make an incredibly expand expect it completely straight up twisted , one of the self cognitive , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think that &apos;s the pressure , in the last 500 years together with many artists , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years countless artist . 
if it &apos;s so at least , i think , is this so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to more ancient past , to look at them for human and creativity understand ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes talk , 抹杀 off developed 500多年 rationality the ideas we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes talk , 抹杀 off developed 500多年 better human . 
well , maybe i could not convince you that you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why not in a way of thinking ? but i want to say is , why not ? why not in a way of thinking about ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why not in a way of thinking about ? 
this process , for any had tried to make people believe that there is that you &apos;ve all had this kind of experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it is we can make sense 
like a 雷鸣 of the mall , really and the next to her . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this piece of energy would 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this piece of energy would 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
and now , she &apos;s the only thing to do the only thing with her words , that &apos;s “ 死命 to 狂奔 ” 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and then she would take out the other hand , grab that poem tail it 顺势 pull back , and the other hand , and will poetry 誊写 on paper to make it 顺势 pull back , and the other hand , and will poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper , except sequence is upside down , from my last word to , by and go , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like , it &apos;s unbelievable , and it &apos;s my creative process exactly the same ! of course it &apos;s not my creative process of all , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 like me , and also inadvertently get incredible inspiration , but even 古板 like me , and also inadvertently get incredible . 
there &apos;s a lot of people might have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i will meet and to the idea of where you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , it &apos;s going to meet and to i don &apos;t know where inspiration . 
this is exactly what happened ?

at ted in 2009 , al gore showed the world &apos;s new situation , climate trend that &apos;s more than scientists to worry about , and that he for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore for recently climate trend warning . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about the north polar ice cap demo in the last 三百万年 in the area of the equivalent of the american south 48 state area 缩减 a 40 percent . 
but that didn &apos;t fully illustrate that question . because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
it feels like the polar ice cap -- just like a good global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is a permanent 冻 ice 
you see , it &apos;s in a dark blue here is that every winter form of the year in the summer 冻 permanent ice , ice . 
what &apos;s called the “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or more years to form of ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that warming makes the arctic ocean around 冻土 layer 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon and 干冰 &#93; 解冻 , microbial compost methane , carbon . 
if you break the little , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be present in the atmosphere , total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in alaska in the lake has been able to see the water 探头 of 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 went to a light lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the boreal sink , which is a heat heating . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it has to be better than traffic 往年 . 
this is greenland southwest kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of ice melts how to make sea level rise , and here &apos;s the 入海口 
here are 急速 traffic . 
antarctica , the other side of the planet , the biggest ice . 
last month , scientists , on the continents are in the amount of the stage . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt 
that &apos;s equivalent to sea level with 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world from its molten water get half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of the drinking water . 
traffic was . 
but when they disappear , and we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you can see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
the global dry that are causing fires in numbers . 
and the world &apos;s population are disasters , with absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years in time 总数 , to the earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we day increases 七千万吨 co2 emissions 两千五百万吨 co2 to the oceans . 
look at the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
greenhouse effect of the big reasons , in addition to the forest destruction of 20 percent is burning fossil fuels . 
oil , coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big , one of our country , and china . 
the solution was to build a use more coal carbon planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some of the new green alternative 
so now -- but , in our country has a political war . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry , last year , spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth , in my hometown of tennessee digging up of billions of coal 淤泥 . 
well , you see on the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
this is a before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of coal carbon industry . 
coal cool sir is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive , and he also help us develop economies 
coal cool sir every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
this is west virginia , a lot of coal waste 产地 
most of the top is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and now one of the president of launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part of the 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money with our initial goal tried to understand and explaining coal truth . 
in fact , coal not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , not for global warming and . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal factory . 
spectacular machine some 喧哗 ! 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , one of the main reasons why here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the united states are in the economy and national security , the climate crisis 
will the crisis is strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products on like messy coal and import oil 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve the problem of projects . 
repower america with 100 percent renewable electricity in 10 years . 
and the united states who get to new work that we live more safe , and let the earth , not in warming . 
and finally , a large enough of the solutions to our problems . 
repower america , know more . 
the final 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
that old dirty oil is in the murder of our planet , which is , let &apos;s cut on the dependent on the fastest way . 
the future is here . wind and solar and new energy network . 
the new investment to create more money there &apos;s lots of jobs . 
repower america . it &apos;s time to dream well . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you &apos;re going to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you &apos;re going to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go away , and fast . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember that you &apos;re being a kid age played kit . 
when you design and how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re learning how to think about and problem solving . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that 空间结构 really helps us around for a lot of learning things . 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , therefore the infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable interact , it &apos;s a computer as cookie of size . 
siftables can use my hands just move , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information of the tools . 
the tools that are independent , more sensitive to each other senses , feel any with mobile , so we can use this tool to try something new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this siftable have 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows that in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , maybe , then images , and in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables to each other feel . 
if you give them a 挨 a out ok , interesting is going to happen . 
and if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that there &apos;s a kind of chaos . 
they can sense each other &apos;s moving and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures and siftables , for example , like a liquid that the color from a siftable into another piece siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel with paint patterns of siftables , we can put it in the bucket color pour in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it much , can you go back a few . 
siftables and learning a function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , faster that result . 
this is also , i &apos;m here to show siftables reason -- and applause . this is me with a simple equation made of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix together words game . 
this together words that play a game to act like the , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together to make a word , siftables in the dictionary , the automatic find words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell sequence , change it shows the letters , to make the right word , and you can try to use other letters to build new words . 
and so -- thank you . 
so now -- now , i have on the screen some kids are in the media lab because in the test siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in play this game together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , and this is a “ together words ” game , then they know how to do this . 
now i have on the screen other people in experience siftables . 
the lower right-hand corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just wanted to siftables pile together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now i have on the screen a animation function interact to try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
and on this kid &apos;s felix . 
he could use some new elements add to animation image , what he did was to make the desk siftables pick up towards animation images put a video , you can put these new element to put it on . 
see , he put the sun add up . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
put that in animation shake siftables images that can bring new elements add to the image on his new element to add up -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he &apos;s planning to develop stories plot . 
the cat sat in a balloon off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show that the function , but in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables the function of the sound domain , can make like 超载 tone and bess and drum voice . 
there &apos;s every tiles 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into the siftable by the way you like . 
to sound just come close to the sounds of the modules . 
there &apos;s something which 响器 , a voice , which works siftable module . 
put this kind of come close to sound tiles can adjust the sound . 
so , we can use to control , and the rhythm and volume of siftable come close to the editor tiles siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the 超载 into two editors tiles , and then add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to filter acoustic tile near drums modules , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to put up some rhythm just come close to the rhythm of the modules . 
now , and then bring a voice come close to the tiles shellfish filter voice . 
music playing in the process , and to 编排 . 
so you don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s based on play , over time , but long and short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with the volume come close to the tiles on the left , with the place . 
and so -- thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new can human-computer interaction medium better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable , our follow-up studies that are in the lab to do . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 of technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
