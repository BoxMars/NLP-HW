rapture images and stories through it , the national geographic explorers by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these culture is an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
and of course we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are all born into 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we &apos;re going to sing and dance in 排遣 life that we create 苦楚 art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture song rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different mind makes you see hope 
the world 五彩缤纷 culture 犹如 by a mental life and culture intertwined life and the internet to cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also a strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
as biosphere by severe around in circles like also facing the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet , there were six : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is the human spirit shining 
it &apos;s actually in the spirit of the unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a mind a conscious and a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and the number of our audience as much of the language in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no 传人 do that unless it works they will completely gone . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re a final say 本族语 . people can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i &apos;m going to do is take you to explore this race loop loop race to give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people who have already forgot . i said “ different way of survival ” i said “ ” different ways . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 played methuselah -- the areas that they &apos;re called the 蚺 race , because they believe in a time , they come from the river 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 forest , and so on , and they 天穹 forest canopy didn &apos;t . 
they say , with a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that as a 通婚 异族 went to the people with a different languages married . 
this is the mythology of history legacy , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . a 大家族 often have 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
i was in contact with many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had to peace . 
five year 1957 missionary trying to get these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the air eight to 十张 they himself in the picture we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think these people who live in 雨林中 never seen two-dimensional . 
from the forest , they pick up these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people person , but they found nothing and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 this missionary five died . 
more terror is not only 华拉尼 戮 at people . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of the population was their 戮 to die . 
we &apos;re going to 一个八代 宗谱 survey found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , out to the truth is going to do more 年迈 wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , to the forest , they have astonishing 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell predator 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
born in the soul . 
the dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 below the soul to just replace the soul of life in the short time for the shining 侍僧成 . 
so voodoo believers , like to say , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re cathedral to dance . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
and i had access to all of those groups in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 科基人 the mountains of the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient civilization tyranny of descent , they were once conquered and occupation columbia . the coast in plain 此后 they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent this race has never been the spaniards . 
and today , they get along with 续 monk would rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain the values is with the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 call for 弟兄 we say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain shelter , or god is a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s important for meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia , grew up the local people &apos;s thoughts . i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this photo was me last year in august in northwest amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often used it did die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain with five 羟 color is very close to 成份 . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribes from people will have five -- 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you take a sip powder in these hallucinations , you &apos;ll see 光怪陆离 in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you , but not distorted were totally wiped out 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organ that is called single 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
this is matter to oral color , there is going to change and oral 氧化酶 live other chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that the 藤本植物 there -- β 咔 啉 to control the single is 氧化酶 and play is the potency of color , so you have to ask ourselves 不由得 
when we do all kinds of experiments , and make mistakes and measure . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is they &apos;re all in the jungle in that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them a hierarchy is how to these plants , they said , &quot; i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , and i said , is not understand . 
so i told you , if they said in months circle of the things that grow in the night every plant with a little different , singing to you . 
this that you don &apos;t have to get at harvard university ph.d. , but it &apos;s much more accounting 报表 more fun 
dh : now we have this question , and some of us think that they had the compassion indigenous life 离群索居 丰富多彩 world forward , but as we develop these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been new way of life as strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is the great sioux nation and the people who say goodbye 骑马 and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat race loop 完整性 is not change or technological innovation , it &apos;s the power of all the words , he &apos;s robust . 
we look at of tibet recently where i do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide . it &apos;s cultural destruction people lifestyle 行径 denounce without being in many places it even be a part of this strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese people immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other together fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 成份 by 关押 and family . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding dress and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and be into 学习班 . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the face of hair 臂章 and be in a country of seven years 劳教 guilty . 
the pain of tibet for people to take human redemption mental need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;re going to have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need to a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
we have to think , in the world exist in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 revolution in agriculture , human time to time , we seed , he went to the girl 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra for 祭 for us to create a level of 社会分工 . it &apos;s 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to make that we have the ability to solve the challenges facing 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 a different . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely species to recognize that we have to make sure that all race and all of those organisms 昌盛 for life . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the top . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people tell me about a legacy of about his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old man to move . 
his family worried that his security put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear them cold , it &apos;s god , it alone . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he sleep outside wearing his skin 长裤 . he put a stool and to hand when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this to a shit blades 口水 and make it in the frozen and become very robust and he used it to 刀子 宰杀 dog . 
the 剥 dogs bark into a 挽具 he and his dog made out of a dog sleds to another -- and that when you don &apos;t put it in a shit ice sheet . 
this is really make 空手 life . 
in many ways . this is inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
1999 four months canada government to a area than the area of the texas and california &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is good , a country that can make a difference to think about how to fix it , and the relationship between people . 
and i think the world for ever on a remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a 族类 home . 
they represent branches of human imagination , go back to the ancient of time for all of our people , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and tv can do is we believe that politicians do not . 
we think dh : debate is not to convince people , but we think about it and get to make the world , so we can change the world &apos;s at about the institutions of our website , as a click of thousands of three to five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from the internet . use pick out a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and can navigate it . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
we see here is so many many gb 千兆 byte . level of digital photographs , and they can do for and smooth zoom in , by the way you can mapping through them , and we can do to rearrange them . 
it can see how many images of data , how big and image how big itself , seadragon all have this ability to deal with . 
so most of you are a digital camera picture taken , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system , the only factor is just , you can use the screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of data . 
this is what he dickens &quot; 荒凉 山庄 line , &quot; is chapter of content . 
i gave you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be a reading an electronic book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture of 张大 opening . 
and the paper , or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , when people get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in this a &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you just see the ad to a lot of high resolution , the picture embedded in the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to actually use a screen area limits . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and this information . 
obviously , with this technology , with digital maps , of course , it &apos;s one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field of our contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually by two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from graduate school at the university of washington noah snavely can do with computer vision research . this research and get steve seitz washington university . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
in this project we &apos;ve got on the internet , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to do with multiple ways of looking at , and to do with subtlety 剖析 and have resolution of many to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot better than this sense of space and strong . 
because when we made the site , to take care of the legal issues . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by 串联 up in space . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
this is really amazing , . pretty happy . 
i think you can see these images from the camera , a lot of different from a single cell phone camera to the . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment was put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , a lot of pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
i remember here , there should be a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to rebuild , to see in the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can work to use the internet community . we can get from everybody data to everybody for different environmental memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , have a much more than just to collect it all . 
this is a model , however , is the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
the user , picture will be 注 tag on you . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years will come from the picture 接合 together ? 
the software . this is the real meaning , is to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this 接合 process is completely based on images of content . 
more exciting images that contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , what you &apos;re in the picture , the key word later , the web to have a lot of text with this picture that information . 
now , suppose you all these pictures and images together , that would be like ? 
now , so these semantic information to each other inside of links , and is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about this book of content hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a the standard principles about it . 
well , what the standard ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 疑 笃信 principles . 
well , this is that , if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is it that freedom with itself is good , valuable , for what they need to . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can 做主 yourself with the way the big enough to get people to welfare , don &apos;t they 做主 for me . 
freedom to do a lot of the way it is on the largest increase selective . 
people more choices , freedom , which are much more freedom , get welfare is more . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that deep-rooted that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily of life . 
let me give you some examples look at the social progress development , we become possible to do something . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
i just want to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , it &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one to store it a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
in the store components , you can have a close 650万种 the combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t don &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you refer to phone service , which had to go to the bell , just a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , it &apos;s time to the dead are not bad . 
that are 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially cell phones . now , that cartoons . 
these are the mobile phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 -- that will take mp three the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , can &apos;t use a long , you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people went to the store , and you ask : is there a without so much function ? &quot; 
you want to answer is , what ? 
answer is no “ ” . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phone . 
again , in some other lives more than shopping to affect the things we have the bang , this is the same . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , doctors straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail . there are things and risk . 
and so forth . there &apos;s 乙 things and risk treat . you want to do ? 
and you say , “ doctor , i should do ” how ? 
they said , again , a nail these things and risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for the ordinary people with you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why should we do to promote market ? 
answer is , they want to look at the advertising , and the next morning going to call your doctor , and they put on a prescription drugs on them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now we gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but to invented by themselves . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do what people and a man and woman decide . &quot; 
in marriage of the family , and everybody was married to the age of course it &apos;s almost thing , and is 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
you need only choice is and who are not married , and when i , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and now , about everything that can take to pick 拣 挑拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart good students , but now i give them all placed homework fifth time less than one . 
it &apos;s not because they than ever before -- and the students stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re thinking , are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask myself , i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t married ? is going to now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to first child , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do i all placed homework , whether they &apos;re i take a class what grades . 
they really should go to the problem , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in any one time , in a work in the corner -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place can wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you in god . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible freedom to bring us is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , for their work now that &apos;s right , and the rest . 
we go to kid play football , in a 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 it in with their blackberry blackberry . so , with the lap and laptops . 
even though they &apos;re off , we are looking at in 场上 rivals for children and constantly ask myself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
back to this email or not ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this an 信稿 ? 
even if you give their answer is no , you have children and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whatever . it &apos;s a small thing , matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world is like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s a good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
one , some say up an oxymoron , which is , so -- to bring us is not emancipation , but box , is paralysis . 
so many people have the choice to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a about pension plan for investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest vanguard record . vanguard is a big support fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
her research that &apos;s when the clients and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 fund 10 percent , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
get tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make a lot of things about 5千元 employer 对等 from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , it &apos;s too many choices are paralysis rigid . 
it makes us into the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make that decision is the right , right ? 
there you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation , or is it salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the easy puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make choices . 
secondly , economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice can think about it , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you gave up to attract people aspect . and that makes you always chosen to you that think 美中不足 . 
for example , so -- that comics , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is now you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
can better than that ? it &apos;s now are thinking “ huh , really bad , ” “ in august , ” is now . 
manhattan “ neighbors don &apos;t ” at home . 
i &apos;m going to “ is back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost percent and the good parking opportunity . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let us to have to make a decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in that it &apos;s more , and all these things into the opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also say the “ live in the sense that the ” . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , of a truth is , when you chose to do something , and that you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing is to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and third , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time , i went to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time to wash long enough , after a million times , get 凑合 pants . 
so , in this pants for many years old , i finally 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , and it &apos;s 宽松 for ? 
the first to 扣子 and pull locked ? 石磨 , or is wash ? 
a kind of quickly to them ? 
and the mouth , and is a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i said , i &apos;m going to “ that was the only ” kind of pattern . 
he fog and water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is , because there are so many can choose for a sex , my jeans what should have good to be a good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i didn &apos;t expect that much . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least a is the best 极致 perfect . 
it &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i take i had to , and i want to do , and i expect more than this one up , i became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for the right thing to improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond didn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just to make people and less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
there &apos;s nobody to market to understand this , because if they know there &apos;s people , and you don &apos;t have the opportunity to know what is this idea . i mean it . 
it &apos;s like this and in comics , in all things are bad past all better than now . 
and the reason why is that when a where things are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , in our these rich , industrial civic life in the world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every one of the things you can only hope than you would expect , it &apos;s not bad . 
you will never be what was amazing , because you my than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so thank you . i want to talk about ourselves a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of on the jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and out there on the jeans hundreds of excuses , you don &apos;t put things f it up . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to the very best , and they have to decide -- is so disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world and the developed world -- clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but they don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
i remind you . 
this and bring it to the standard -- well , we all think is right , it &apos;s wrong . it &apos;s not right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a key value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond the ‘ &apos;s rich ’ choice , we need to the critical value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that have so many choices , is a rich matter . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least , we heard a few of them , where the question is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern western societies , on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday said , amazing 气愤 question is , we produce the expensive and it &apos;s the car seats , just in 于事无补 waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is the expensive and complicated choice is not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us harm . 
they actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and improve practice . 
product redistribution will make all , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our another choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in this fish in everything is ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs “ ” this fish . 
in this fish -- and you know , for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from the numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” , i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get the digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome from biology , and it was analysis entered the world , the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to question , if we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , and mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 genes that we 一百组 separate out in front of these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study is the synthetic chromosomes , so we can change its components to continue to question the basic problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never make a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way down , just some not live as chemicals . 
our digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it still increasing . and what we &apos;re going to put speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact , it through the stages . and when we do for the first trial ago , i have a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline process , made the long time , that &apos;s much more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together , and it all wrong . 
this is our first from phi x 174 , to try and bacteriophage genome -- to digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the most exciting stage is when we put this video there live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building the virus particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli and 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some communication , i think they model to understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so what we think this is actually a biological systems in software can build in their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that those numbers to be very accurate information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , gene sequencing right is the standard every 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , on average , in sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of piece of design 50 character and the other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units of time . we need to design that they can together . 
we have a design of the unique part . 
you may have heard about us to 水印 in one . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
the character of 三联 body -- and the character 编成 about 20 amino acids every amino acids , that &apos;s a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and can use to cut 裁 enzyme . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , 7000 character from the length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character and the length of time to time 几组 merger , into a long time , at people . 
in every stage , we produce a lot of time and so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece , over 100 people to basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example of that is a little radiation 球菌 can withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will be back together again before their original form . 
we have 千种 can do it . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is the mentioned yeast way and put it in the right after we design pieces . yeast automatically aggregates them . 
this is not an image microscopic ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
these are long , about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than 580000 character long gene code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t find in 10号 distance , it will print out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is a very simple process bacteria more complicated . 
like ourselves with this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole transplant cells from the chromosome from one to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we try to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that for a second of all species or from other parts of the chromosome , the third side , in a second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
what used by people in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of organisms . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limits , is to be able to enzyme digesting the dna . 
the cells to have this enzyme enzyme without it , and when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a has a new dna . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original characteristics of all species disappear , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , in fact , is that we put into it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we really get through dna , to move to dramatically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of a life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to each of us from 1946 is ; the people in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , all the fuel , very difficult . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this biological process or any can replace it program , it &apos;s a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that the material that was in the atmosphere of co2 emissions . 
we now from around the world that had a contains about 两千万组 gene database , and i like to see them as the design components . 
there &apos;s only the electric industry , and look for a components that can get diversity . 
now , our main limited from reality in biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can make we call the mixing of “ ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day , the chromosomes . 
and this is just standard choice . we can start to survive , to choose , chemical production , or fuel vaccine production , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit down , really work in the computer to design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what they gene code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it was sugar into higher value of the fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
and the co2 is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
if we look at the two to collect their very convenient , really , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have replace the oil industry 化工 little goal . and -- now , if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there are probably ? become a major energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tool making a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see this year &apos;s flu , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species of bacteria , which is really the 古物 and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this ted 09年 u short of the presentation , brian cox : which shares some super 对撞机 news . the content , including are now to repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to it . it is the machine . 
that &apos;s it , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state , every second 6亿次 and make it a state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these detectors to little some camera big bang . 
this is my that period , a detector atlas 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this one machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first picture clusters particles along the way around the lhc . as what we plan to the lhc . and , in part of a lot of particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know is that it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people go to google , saw that graph is front page . 
this suggests that we work with this as a culture of it as a scientific shock . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the main 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they machine on . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do , because when it &apos;s very low them into the superconducting 导线 . 
so in minus 271摄氏度 space between the temperature of the planet than the case of these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of transmission 安培 suddenly they and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , get data and continue our mission to find out of the most basic units . 
now obviously , one of these accidents to 激化 about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still have my after the fact is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , in a particular event , however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , in a particular event that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and whether i , where people think this is the result is that life , and whether i , where people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , play 完了 ! 
they would be very to come up to me and said , “ ? no . you don &apos;t you in my life . this is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people ! 
i was around in the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in the dream of despair is dead , in failed 苦痛 with , and i was always get to that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i was afraid to a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , the fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? but , the fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? 
no one said , &quot; john , chemical “ work met bottleneck ? how ? ” . 
never would ask this happened . 
and of course , 平心而论 chemical engineers , it &apos;s a group , not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of a century of creative genius , the great examples are 英年早逝 just look at the early years of a century of creative genius , the great examples are 英年早逝 is often age lightly died from .

and the 曼梅 le , died in front of the interview last time i said , “ every one of the book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
for your work life , this is a radical statement . 
i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
you think this idea ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even further away from a look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断

this idea , and not only 可憎 terrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century this idea , and not only 可憎 terrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think , to inspire our great creative genius , they will be to live . 
and i , myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , and i , myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , especially in my career at stage , especially in my career so far . 
you see , i was young , i have to 40 years old , you see , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for life . 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say is , in my heart , and this is probably , this is the most successful in my life is over . 
oh my god , this is what idea . 
is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from the writing , and i work for responses extreme anxiety difference itself , and i started writing for extreme anxiety response . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because we end up to around . 
in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred djinn to from distant and not to know where all the artists , with a remote and you know from distant and the goal is to know where all the artists , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creativity djinn to for “ 守护神 ” 
and for people to think socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 from a distance , wisdom and gives him for people to think socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 , he &apos;s from a distance . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ genius ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this is wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking for this safe distance , and that &apos;s what makes people from work on 成败 psychological protection . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
by the artist conservation , and get this idea of avoid the narcissism ancient artist by this idea and get to protect , excessive narcissism . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of genius “ ” work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is the western in the last very long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , which is too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , a human cognitive self , and for people to make an incredibly expand expect it completely straight up twisted , a human cognitive self , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists kill , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists together . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think this is that our question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 out of the reason we don &apos;t mind with a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 out of the reason . 
maybe i can convince you that we all agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any was trying to make people believe that there are ways you had this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath really and the next to her .

i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and i , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not me all the creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad .

“ if you want this book better , it &apos;s now your turn that part of them , do you work ” . 
if you &apos;re not “ to help , that you see the ” to . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because this is my job . &quot; 
i hope that history today : i 尽责 to 坚守 my jobs € today , i hope that the historical record : i 尽责 坚守 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , although very unlikely , but actually happen one a dancer , going beyond when the 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
it seems to stop , dancers like across the time to stop , across the dancer like he did . and before the 1000场 performance , and no difference , but all of these amazingly it up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life , from the bottom , light from the inside . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , from the inside of his life , light , light from the bottom , he was sacred shine . 
and people know exactly what it is , they can make it was called the name of the people know exactly what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some incredible for the magic , people will 喝彩 : “ -- oh , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 -- oh , great , really , really great , incredible ” that is good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up the tricky for artists , is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on a tuesday morning that was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
and that &apos;s only when bad leg , and you &apos;re going to people and maybe , he couldn &apos;t get that last night , the height . 
maybe no longer there will be in his 喝彩 dance , god with him from good , there are going to do ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of one of our self . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most painful for my self cognitive . this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of one of our self . 
but maybe we were all suffering , so if you were never thought , that wonderful work of art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
in your 坚守 jobs , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re dancer , which dance . 
in your 坚守 jobs , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re dancer , which dance . 
if not , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
and i believe that we have to teach this one . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore here at ted global shows the new situation , climate trend that &apos;s worth more than scientists , and he worried about that for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore recently to climate trends . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about the north polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last thing in the area of the equivalent of the american south 48 state 缩减 40 percent of the area . 
but they can &apos;t exactly that . this problem , because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s a good global climate system beating heart 
the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is permanent ice 冻 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue is a year in the winter and summer ice 冻 permanent ice . 
what “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five or more long ice you see , it &apos;s like blood to transfer 各部 &apos;s body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that around the arctic ocean 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon and . 干冰 解冻 microbes , methane , carbon compost . 
if you break the little , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the light in alaska in the water is you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the boreal deposition heat , which is a heat . 
this is one of the last year . 
but it has to be than traffic 往年 . 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of melting ice on how to make sea level rise here is the 入海口 
here are 急速 traffic . 
antarctica , the other side of the planet earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists report the continents are in decline of the ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s on 20 feet of sea level , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
from 40 percent of the global financial water get half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
the world is in the fire and dry in numbers . 
and the number of disasters , it &apos;s quite unprecedentedly in absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , in time to the earlier 总数 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
every day in the last five years , we increase 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 co2 emissions co2 to the oceans . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of the big reasons , except , of forest destruction burn oil fuel is 20 percent . 
oil , coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution is to build a use more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative . 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political war . 
carbon and oil and coal industries , last year , spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
before and after christmas , my home in tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
can you see on the news . 
here , is the second largest waste , put up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
this is a coal carbon industry . 
mr. coal cool is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive , and he helped us economic development . 
coal cool every day in and become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of coal , west virginia , the 产地 
the big is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and now one of the work of two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal explaining coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , coal and not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , why don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal factory . 
some 喧哗 spectacular machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and the coal burning contributes to global warming is one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing of fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , the climate crisis 
will the crisis is strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products are like on foreign oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solution to this problem . 
america repower with 100 percent clean electricity use a time . 
the new work to get people to our lives more safe , and let the earth is not warming . 
and finally , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the last one . 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to the less dependent on the fastest way . 
the future is here . wind , solar energy , a new network . 
new investment to create a huge job . 
repower . it &apos;s time to america &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go away , and fast . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember that in the era of being a kid you played kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re thinking and learning how to solve problems . this is the object 空间结构 to understand and feel . 
understand that 空间结构 really helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
and that question would be in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so we have this infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable is a computer , as you interact with a big cookie . 
siftables can use my hands just move , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
the tools that are independent , more sensitive to each other , feel any sense , with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe , then images in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a 挨 out a good , interesting is going to happen . 
and if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves each other and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures and siftables , like it to a liquid that color from a siftable into another a siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there &apos;s three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put these barrel into color in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it more , you can go back and some . 
siftables and learning machine function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , one -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , more quickly see it . 
this is i &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- and this is working . i used to make a simple equation of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
this &quot; play games together as a way that the , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together siftables of words , it would look at the word itself in the dictionary . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell it shows that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , that &apos;s some kids are in the media lab because in the test of siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in play this game together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , and this is a “ together words ” game , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the bottom right corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just wanted to of siftables together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now the screen that is a function of trying to interact with it . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the children &apos;s felix . 
he can put some new images to add elements on it , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animation images vote image , you can bring these new to add elements on it . 
see , he add up to the sun . 
the sun it up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
and to shake siftables animation images that can to add to the new element . he put up a new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he was plan out plot how stories . 
the balloon sitting off . 
and i &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function in 编排 can play music is , we &apos;ve developed , siftables function that into sound domain , can make like 超载 sounds and bess and drum voice . 
and there &apos;s 四档 tiles for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there &apos;s this 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles that come to sound can adjust sound . 
so , we can use to control , and the rhythm and volume of the modules siftable to come to adjust the siftable rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the 超载 into the two tiles , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now , in some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles tiles drums , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to accelerate rhythm some just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now , and then bring a voice to the tiles shellfish tiles sound filter . 
in the process and play music to 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s playing , over time , but can play a short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with the volume tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so . thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we &apos;re doing in the lab . 
i want to talk to you the idea is we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
