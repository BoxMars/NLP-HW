rapture images and stories through it , the national geographic explorers by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are all born into 母腹 and 生儿育女 in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 . 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send the different perspectives will let you see , hope 
the world 五彩缤纷 犹如 a culture of mental life and culture intertwined in life , and the internet cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the internet as the biosphere . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity as a symbol that &apos;s what we have a strong , the ability to look at the species . 
in biosphere by severe around in circles like also facing the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet , there were six : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is shining human spirit . 
and it &apos;s essentially a unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a spiritual ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and the number of our audience as much of the language in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has 传人 didn &apos;t do that unless it works they will completely . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be talking final 本族语 who couldn &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 and it &apos;s an old with language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore the race about race loop loop give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people have forgot . i said “ survival ” in front of a different way , as i said “ different survival ” . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 northwest part of the played methuselah -- they &apos;re called 蚺 that the race because they believe in a time , they come from 米尔克 river 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 jungle , so they &apos;re 天穹 forest canopy , with no difference . 
they said , with a weird language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 called 异族 linguistics 通婚 one to the people with a different languages , married people . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon 婚 异族 because of the reason it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
when i was exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had to peace . 
five missionary 1957 years to approach them , but those who made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the air 十张 eight to 10 pictures they himself in our mind that &apos;s nice , but they don &apos;t think that these people who live in 雨林中 never seen a two-dimensional . 
they pick up from the forest to get over these pictures and images , trying to find these people person , but they found nothing . and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears and five missionary 戮 died . 
more terrifying 华拉尼 is not only 戮 external people died . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent death population was their 戮 to die . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 两例 found only natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , the more it will 年迈 to wood , they &apos;ll 戮 his 送终 for him . 
the other hand , they have astonishing for bush 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell predator 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and there &apos;s some other buddhist religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
born in the spirit . 
and the rhythm of dance with 翩翩起舞 can 大水 below the soul to just replace the living soul in that little shining 侍僧成 moment for god . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we dance to be in the temple . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
when i was exposed to all of those groups in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 科基人 the mountains of the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilizational descent , they were once conquered and occupation columbia . the coast in plain 此后 they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody ethnic 肆虐 continent that has never been the spaniards . 
and to today , they 续 along with monk institutions to govern , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk 
they like 母腹 back to those groups are taught the values that maintain these values , and with the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s the beauty of how you want to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 call for our 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to create a very important . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the bitter 思乡 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is the mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s important for meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia as local people &apos;s thoughts . i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultural created a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this is a picture i this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia 徒 萨满教 plants to use it -- dead on the water make psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is made it with brain five 羟 -- which is very close to 成份 . 
jamie tribes 亚诺马 people will have from five 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you use a nose sucked into the powder 光怪陆离 hallucinations , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you were totally wiped out , but not distorted 
but the color is matter that doesn &apos;t oral because they &apos;re going to be one of your body , one is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
this is matter to oral color , there is going to change and oral 氧化酶 living as any chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that the 藤本植物 β exist to control 啉 咔 -- which is a single 氧化酶 and play color is the potency of 不由得 so you have to ask myself . 
when we do all kinds of experiments constantly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is they &apos;re all in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants are not talking about me . 
so i told you , if they said in the circle months , and that night 17 grow every plant to use the different little word singing to you . 
it &apos;s not going to see you get a harvard ph.d. than 报表 accounting , but it is more fun . 
dh : now we have this question , though , some of our compassion something indigenous people think they 离群索居 丰富多彩 living world forward , but as we develop these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been new way of life as a strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is a great sioux nation indians and americans 骑马 to go and sit 马车 lives are still in the united states . 
the threat race 完整性 layer is not change or technological innovation itself , it &apos;s a power line all he was barbaric . 
let &apos;s look at the mountains of tibet recently where i made a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide . it &apos;s cultural destruction people lifestyle 行径 denounce without being in many places it even be a part of this strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother 富农 because 关押 by 成份 and family . 
he was only one or two his mother 悄悄地 put him hidden skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and 学习班 into being . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the president of your hair 臂章 and be guilty about seven years of a nation to accept 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to withstand human redemption mental need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
think about it , we have in the world . 60 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 era for human revolution in our agricultural age , he went to the top of the seeds 腊 girl 萨满 poetry is the mantra for 祭 cheese after we &apos;ve created level 社会分工 . it &apos;s 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to make the future , we have the ability to solve the challenges facing 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that every race , and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i 巴芬岛 in the northern part of the mountain . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 whale call that the people i go to a about his grandfather legendary story . 
in the 1950s , the government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old man refused to move . 
his family worrying about security , and he put his all weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , which is their god alone , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in north america 鹿皮 caribou 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and blizzard 凛冽 . 
he slept outside wearing his seal 长裤 he took skin stool pulled to these when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this shit to make a 口水 on the edge blades , and then it becomes very frozen solid , he used it to a dog 刀子 宰杀 . 
the dogs bark 剥 挽具 and then he made a dog made out of his dog sleds condoms in the middle and that when you don &apos;t put it in a shit ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways dh : this is inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 area of the government to california and texas than 之和 area of land back to the big returned to the inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a terrific shows a country can do something with it managed to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , i think the world for ever on a remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent branches of human imagination dates back to the origin of the ancient times for all of us , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make . 
we think dh : debate is not to convince people through , but we think about it can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s at about the institution to our website , as a click of the three thousands of five 百万次 
we 156 channels out in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from the internet picky . using a static image photosynth , created an absolute brute dream of view , and can navigate it . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is many many gb 千兆 and byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can do for smooth and mapping zoom in , by the way you can browse them , you can do to rearrange them . 
it can see how many images of data , how big the image , and how much seadragon , has these processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , having 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system , the only factor is just , you can use the screen like 素数 seadragon . and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s data is an image . 
this is what dickens had 荒凉 &quot; 山庄 , &quot; is chapter three content . 
i &apos;ll give you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be a reading an electronic book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture of 张大 opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , reading , people will get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in this a &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture advertising than this -- you see a normal commercial higher resolution , embedded in the image of the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
the way to an extent , averted screen actually used the limits of area . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology with digital maps , it &apos;s obvious one applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you about this field we &apos;ve made their contributions . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merge with two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and another who graduate from the university of washington snavely noah undertake computer visual research findings . it &apos;s got at the university of washington seitz steve 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got application , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to have multiple ways to look at pictures and images , to make the subtlety 剖析 and have more resolution browse experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there are many examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , to take care of the legal issues . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by 串联 up in space . 
and then we can so easily , to have views . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this pretty amazing welcome , really happy . 
i think you can see that the images from a lot of different cell phone camera , from the camera into a single professional . so a lot of different quality images , in this environment was all put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 pictures , etc . 
i remember this should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to the poster to see the rebuilding of the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can effectively online community with everyone . we can start to get everyone to different data environment memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , all the secondary out to all gather much more than just up . 
this model of the crime , is the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like stephen lawler &quot; virtual earth long tail market . &quot; 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
the user , be 注 you picture the labels . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years will come from global 接合 pictures together ? 
yeah . the software that &apos;s the real meaning to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this 接合 process is completely based on the content of the picture . 
more exciting is that picture of text semantic contains information . 
for example , what you &apos;re in the picture , the key word later , the web is going to have a lot of text with this picture , the relevant information . 
now , suppose you all of these pictures and images together , that would ? 
and so these semantic information to each other inside of links , and is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
barry 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think here to talk about this book , i hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to talk from one recognized the creed of it . 
well , what the standard ? 
that &apos;s the western 笃信 疑 industrial society is not a principles . 
well , this is to say , if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is it that freedom with itself is good , valuable , for people are essential . 
and once people had freedom , each of us can 做主 ourselves with all the way the big enough to get people to welfare , don &apos;t they 做主 for me . 
and the freedom to make a lot to do is the largest increase selective limits . 
people more choices , it &apos;s more freedom , freedom , getting more and more that welfare . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that deep-rooted that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives yet . 
let me give you some examples of modern society &apos;s advance development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
i just wanted to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s this one in a pop-up stores sound system is much couldn &apos;t count . 
with this store components that you can have 650万种 close out all the combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this family . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , the telephone is going to die are not bad . 
the date 一去不返 already . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially cell phones . now , that cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 that will mp three play -- with a machine , cutting hair and french 焦糖 布丁 火枪 in . 
if you haven &apos;t on your right next to the store , if seen with no don &apos;t worry , how do you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store , and you ask : is there a without so much function ? &quot; 
you think , is to answer ? 
“ answer is no ” . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things phone . 
again , in the lives of more than any other shopping to affect the things that we have the same , the bang existed . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , who straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail solutions are things and risk . 
and so forth 乙 solutions for things with risk . how do you want to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
they said , again , there are these things and nail 乙 risk , there are those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you take that ” ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for these people with you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why are they doing marketing campaign to us ? 
they want to answer is , we looked at the morning after advertising would go to your doctor , and the doctor to call the prescription drugs put into them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now we gender , not from my parents down there , but inherited invented by myself . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do a kind of men and women -- and make decisions . 
in the marriage of families in the past everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is of course , and that is 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices and who is getting married , rather than when you see , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and now , about everything that can take 挑拣 pick 拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart best students , but now i give them all placed homework less than one fifth time . 
it &apos;s not because they and their than ever before -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask yourself : i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is it going right now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do i all placed homework , whether they had in my class what an achievement . 
they actually have to think about this problem , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day , any time in any one of the work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this hotel where did have a wifi can , but i don &apos;t tell you are . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible free choice for us is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , to work for themselves now is to break hanging around . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 with all the mobile phone , another 裤兜 it in with their blackberry blackberry and -- the lap , and the laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the same 场上 rivals for children are constantly ask myself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to this email or not ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this an 信稿 ? 
if you give their answer is no , you have children and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a piece of cake . and matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we &apos;ve lived in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world is this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say this is a bad . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
first of all , it says something paradox , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us not liberating , but inside , is paralysis . 
so many choices with people to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is about a project to wait pension investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to recorded vanguard investment vanguard . that &apos;s a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
she survey found is that when these customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is about two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 fund 10 percent , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , preferably tomorrow &apos;s , of course , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to the year of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , it &apos;s too many choices are numb rigid . 
and it allows us to the world like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you must really want you to do is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where do you really don &apos;t want to choose a wrong foundation , or a salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
more choices , the more easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make decisions . 
secondly , economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today , dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice can think about it , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you quit to attract people aspect . and that makes you always chosen to you that 美中不足 think . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is now , you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
gorgeous beach 明媚 , sunlight , they have all this . 
you can better than this ? this is where it thinking “ huh , really bad , ” “ ” , in august now . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home ” . 
i &apos;m going to be “ back to the car stop in my own front ” . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost percent better chance in the parking . 
“ ” opportunity cost has enabled us to have to make a decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in that is more of these things , and it became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also says “ out in the present whatsoever ” this principle . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , in a sense is , when you chose to do something , you and you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other things tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time i went to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time , enough to wash over a million times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , in this pants for many years old , i finally 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , and it &apos;s 宽松 for ? 
the 扣子 to pull the was locked 石磨 ? it &apos;s acid wash ? 
you just a quick them ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i ask “ , i &apos;m going to that was the only kind of pattern ” . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i can take a me the most 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is because there are so many can choose for a sex , my jeans exactly how good is going to be greatly good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i didn &apos;t expect that much . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , better at least a 极致 is perfect . 
it &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i want to do , and i expect more than this one up , and it becomes disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things would improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond doesn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize and less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
there &apos;s nobody to market to understand this , because if they sense . there &apos;s people understand it , you don &apos;t have to know what is this idea . i mean cartoons . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in all these things are bad past , everything is better than now . 
and the reason why is that when a where things are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every single thing you most only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
you never know what , what would be , because you my than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , which is you here today to want to know , the secret to happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
and so -- i want to talk about their smoking a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 no , i try . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
out there on the jeans , no excuse hundreds of the things you might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re good to decide -- is so disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world and the developed world -- clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
and the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this &#91; choose to bring happiness -- the standard principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond ‘ choice ’ rich , and we need to the critical value . 
i said it quickly . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that have so many choices , is a huge abundance of matter . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least , we heard a few of those problems , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern western societies on a particular problem . 
steve 里维特 . yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we make those expensive and to the babies 于事无补 car seats , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , these expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really bring us harm . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 thomas improve practice . 
products redistribution will allow all , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess choice . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position “ said , &quot; huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in everything on this fish is impossible ” . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you &apos;ve added is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs ” “ this fish . 
in this fish and -- you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means , maybe it &apos;s going to suffering , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from the numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life ” “ , i think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from a biological mimic analysis entered the world , the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome in the lab to make it replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 from the genes that we 一百组 separate out in front of these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue to ask the basic problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never make a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way down , don &apos;t live is just some sort of chemicals . 
our digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it still increasing . in our recent is going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact , it took me through the stages . when we did the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world &apos;s 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna , which , in 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline process , long time , i made a mistake , the more and more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together and put all wrong . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 genome -- and start bacteriophage digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the second phase of exciting is that when we put this video there live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli 革 and 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some of the oil industry , and i think they communicate with this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this is actually software can build on a biological system within our own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information that digital information . that must be very accurate . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , right , gene sequencing is every 10,000 primary criteria for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , the average in sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design work is part of the piece of design 50 character and the other 50 character long 叠加 clip to build smaller units time . we need to design that they can together . 
we &apos;re designing there &apos;s a unique part . 
you may have heard about in which we add 水印 . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 the body -- and these scripts 编成 about 20 amino acids , each of these amino acids , there &apos;s a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and you can use to cut enzyme 裁 . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , which 7000 character from time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character and the length of time to time 几组 merger , 72 7,000 into a long time . 
in every stage , we got this piece of culture , so we can give them -- because we wanted to create a very reliable process a minute , you &apos;ll see 
we try to reach the level of the automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very big piece 7,000 for more than 100 , basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to other ways . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation that is able to withstand 球菌 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is a front mentioned yeast way and put it in the right after we design pieces . yeast automatically aggregates them . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
these are , long about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than 580000 character long genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10号 with helvetica , it will print out 142页 . and you need to print the genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple process a bacterium is more complicated . 
with like us this is a relatively simple biology , and you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they came to the 连成 cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole transplant shift the chromosome from one cell into another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we try to bring this process of design into some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve all had a second chromosomes species or from elsewhere in the third side , a second 数千种 increased new features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution , and it would have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digesting the dna . 
the original cells have this enzyme without this enzyme when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a contains a new dna . 
we put in gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original species feature all disappeared , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells ” “ new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , in fact that we put into it . 
this might sound like 炼金术 genes , but we really can move through dna , and to radically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we do need for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to every single one of us from 1946 ; there are people in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 for people to provide food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this biological process or any can replace it program , it would be a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , this is the material that was the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
and we found from around the world has a database contained 两千万组 about genes , and i like to see them as the future of design components . 
there &apos;s only the electric industry , and look for a components that can get diversity . 
now , our main limit from reality biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because they can make a mixture of what we call “ chromosome ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can start to survive to choose , chemical production , or fuel vaccine manufacturing , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit in the computer working really use software to design the design of the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code looks like . 
we &apos;re starting to put “ 第四代 ” fuel . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad experiment . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it &apos;s sugar into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
sunlight and carbon dioxide is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep , about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
if we look at the two to collect what &apos;s really , really convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase the &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have replace the 化工 oil industry . and little goals applause . if you can &apos;t do that , at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tool making a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see in this case , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine for change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , now , with synthetic 古物 species of bacteria , and it &apos;s nuclear biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
at u 09年 in this short of the presentation , brian cox : which shares some super 对撞机 news . the content , including are now to repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said it back to give you an update on to the machine running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
it &apos;s ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use it for a big bang some camera detector . 
this is what i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first picture clusters particles go along the lhc . around like we &apos;re planning to the lhc . and , in a part of the particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know is that it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people go to google , saw that graph front page . 
this suggests that we work with this as a culture of it as a scientific shock . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the main 导线 about -- the golden 导线 . 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they started machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do , because when it becomes very low 导线 superconducting them . 
so at minus planet 271摄氏度 under the temperature of the space between the case of these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 电磁铁 九千多个 in one of the 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises that it is a little bit of a sudden they transmission 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnets damage . 
must 卸 them down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , to get the data and continue our mission to find out the most basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but that &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task still with us for the fact that my itself , which is where the value of the lhc . 
thank you . 
elizabeth gilbert . 呵护 talk about creativity and reduce the creative . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love the obsessed with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love the obsessed with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love the obsessed with life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event , however , recently , in my life work , a specific event happened that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and no matter where i , people think this is the result is that life , and no matter where i , people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , play 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very depression , came to me and said , you don &apos;t “ ? not afraid that you &apos;re afraid of my life is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s really going to comfort people ! 
i was around in the same question , people say , you &apos;re afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair , filled with die in the 苦痛 failed , i was always get to that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , talking about fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? but , talking about fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people afraid of doing their own destiny work ? it logical ? 
nobody “ said , &quot; john , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ” ? 
never would have been on this question . 
and of course , 平心而论 chemical engineers , it &apos;s a group , not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of the century , the great 英年早逝 wizards in which case just look at the early years of the century , every field 英年早逝 wizards great creativity is always the case light died from age . 
they don &apos;t even suicidal , often doesn &apos;t completely shows their talent that are not even suicidal , often doesn &apos;t completely shows their brilliance 
and the 曼梅 le , died in front of the interview last “ said , &quot; i have every book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
for your life &apos;s work , this is how radical statement . 
today i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
all of you think this sentiment ? no problem , even a little bit further away at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of a little bit further away from 臆断 even look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 
this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century 可憎 , but this idea , and awful , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative genius , they will be to live . 
and for myself , believed that it brings me to 绝境 dark , and for myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , especially in my career stage right now , especially in my work now . 
you see , i was young , i came to 40 years old , you know , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for career 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say , is the heart of friends , and it really possible , and i &apos;ve ever been the most successful . 
oh my god , this is what idea ! 
is this idea , makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine on the road , not just this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano wine on the road , no . i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance away from the writing , and i work for extreme anxiety open outcry from the writing , and i work for responses extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because to end sent back to our problems . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred tense from distant djinn , and you know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know from distant and the goal is to know where the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with the djinn “ for creativity to 守护神 ” 
and for people to think socrates is such a 守护神 , from a distance , he was giving people to think that general wisdom socrates is such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius djinn “ called ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create djinn “ called ” genius 
this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particular individual 聪慧 . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people from 成败 work on protecting mechanism . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass “ ” geniuses work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you &apos;re really bad “ ” genius 
this is the western in the last very long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , that &apos;s too big . 
this is a completely twisted people self cognitive , and for people to make an incredibly expanding expected it completely straight up twisted , one of the self and cognitive , for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists to kill , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists together . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think this is that our question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 better off the ideas we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 off the 500多年 developed rationality . 
maybe i could not convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make us believe that you &apos;ve all had to sit on this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a 雷鸣 where really breath , and the next to her . 
she could feel it , because it &apos;s a piece of energy would 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
she could feel it , because it &apos;s a piece of energy would 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with the only thing that she would say , is to “ 死命 狂奔 ” 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail 顺势 and put it back on the other hand , to 誊写 poetry on paper 顺势 and put it back on the other hand , to 誊写 poetry on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper , except sequence is upside down , from the beginning , the last word go by , until after the first words . 
i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s incredible , and i , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 like me , and also inadvertently get incredible inspiration , but even 古板 , and as i have to get an accident . 
there &apos;s many of you may have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have don &apos;t know where inspiration , and you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have don &apos;t know where inspiration comes . 
this is exactly what happened ? 
in how we &apos;re looking at it , it will not rational loss ? in how we &apos;re looking at it , it will not losing rational ? 
he hasten to want to capture it , but there is no way , he &apos;s no paper pen tape , no , he was trying to capture it , but there is no way , he &apos;s no paper pen , no tape

he &apos;s looking up the sky , looking for it said “ sorry , you can &apos;t see i was driving ? ” seem like i could immediately next piece that look like ?

since that event later , tom &apos;s change the creative process . 
it &apos;s not work changed , and he &apos;s still the dark , we &apos;re still onto something . 
for inspiration can is his and the external unknown between being weird , wonderful and strange relationship for inspiration can is his and the external unknown between being weird , wonderful and strange relationship that &apos;s a beyond ourselves . 
this story 潜移默化 my work to change the way , this transformation has saved me this story again 潜移默化 my work to change the way , this transformation has saved me again . 
it &apos;s not just , it &apos;s completely shit , i began to think i should give up to write this book . 
it &apos;s not just , it &apos;s completely shit , i began to think i should give up to write this book . 
and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 thing , and i tried to try and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 that , and then i tried to . 
and i lift the manuscript , to the corner of an empty room , and i lift the manuscript , to one of the room . 
“ because you can see , i &apos;ve shot for the committed no kept ” “ because you can see , i &apos;ve shot for the committed ” . no . 
“ if you want this book better , it &apos;s now your turn that part of them , do you work ” . 
if you don &apos;t “ to help , that you see your ghost to ” . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because this is my job . &quot; 
today , i hope that the historical record 坚守 尽责 : i have my € jobs , i hope today that the historical record 尽责 : i 坚守 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , although rarely see , but actually happen at a dancer going beyond present 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
it seems to stop , across time dancers seems to be stopped , across the dancer was what he did before the movement and 1000场 performance isn &apos;t anything different , but everything was amazingly unified up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was the sacred shine . 
and people , clearly know what it is , they can call out of its name was clearly , people know what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing wondrous give , people will 喝彩 “ : arturo la , 欧 嘞 欧 , pull 嘞 , oh , really great , excellent ” incredible , which is good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , 悠悠 dancers to turn up for artists , the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on a tuesday morning , that &apos;s 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
it &apos;s just that when bad leg , older people are going to you , and he might last night , couldn &apos;t get that level . 
maybe never somebody dance , in his 喝彩 god with him from good , there are going to do ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most painful for my self cognitive . this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
but maybe we were all suffering , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re dancer , which dance . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re dancer , which dance . 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 欧 : 嘞 ! 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 欧 : 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach the idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore on the ted shows the new situation , global climate trend that more than a scientist , and he was worried that for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about polar ice cap demo 三百万年 in the area of by the equivalent of the american south 48 state 缩减 40 percent of the area . 
but that didn &apos;t fully illustrate that question . because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
it feels like the polar ice cap -- just like a good global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer 舒张 heart heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is 冻 permanent ice 
you see , it &apos;s in every winter dark blue here is a form of the year in summer , ice 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or more years to form of ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that allow the arctic ocean warming 冻土 受热 layer around , and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon 干冰 and 解冻 -- when methane , carbon microbial compost . 
now , if the dots , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the light in alaska in the lake has been able to see the 沼气 探头 water . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter 结队 professor to a shallow lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
one reason , the boreal sink , which is a heat heating . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it has to 往年 than traffic . 
this is kangerlussuaq southwest greenland . 
if you want to understand the land of ice melts , sea levels rising and how to make it 入海口 . 
here are 急速 in traffic . 
the other side of the earth , the largest ice on the planet . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
so that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of global financial gain from the other half of the water . 
in the ice 安第斯 mountains , this is the city of drinking water . 
traffic was . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you can see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
global dry that are causing fires in numbers . 
and the world &apos;s population are disasters in quite unprecedentedly absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years in time , to the earlier 总数 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we day 七千万吨 increasing co2 两千五百万吨 co2 emissions from the ocean . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
warming biggest reason of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil fuel is 20 percent . 
oil and coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution was to build a use more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
before and after christmas , my home in tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
you probably saw in the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
this is a coal carbon industry . 
coal mr. cool is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive , and he helped us to develop economies 
coal mr. cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , the coal 产地 
the biggest is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore is one of the president now and we launched two projects . 
this is one part of one of them . 
coalergy in very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to set our initial goal explaining coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , coal not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , don &apos;t worry about it for global warming . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plants . 
喧哗 some spectacular machine . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , climate crisis 
will the crisis is strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products on like messy coal and import oil 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solutions to solve these problems . 
america repower with 100 percent renewable electricity with a time . 
let &apos;s get americans new work that we live more safe , and it &apos;s not in the warming . 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
to understand more repower america . 
the last one . 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
old dirty oil was murder our planet , which is , let &apos;s cut to rely on the fastest way . 
the future is here . wind and solar and new energy network . 
the new big investment to create more money . 
repower . it &apos;s time to america &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember that you &apos;re in the age of being a kid with a kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
what really helps us 空间结构 objects around for a lot of learning things . 
and that question would be in my mind , so we decided to find answers , therefore the infant siftables . 
simply say siftable , with a computer , it &apos;s like a cookie size . 
siftables can use my hands just move , 每块 siftable can perceive moves , each other , each other 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can have with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
with independence , tools that are more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
there &apos;s this siftable 映 like it , if i put it on to tilt , so it &apos;s indicated in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe that image tilted towards the opposite direction . 
and these siftables perception to each other . 
if you give them a 挨 out a good , interesting phenomenon will happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that will have a mess . 
they can perceive moves with each other , maybe . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use siftables and interact with gestures , like a liquid that down from the color of siftable siftable into another one . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put these barrel into color in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it was , how can we go back a few . 
siftables and learning machine function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , faster that result . 
this is my siftables here to show you why -- and applause . this is a simple equation , i use a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble boggle and remix word games together . 
this together . we play a game like down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter 几块 siftables together to make a word siftables , in the dictionary automatically find words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spelling out to change the sequence shows up , the words , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so -- thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because siftables part of the test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in play this game together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , and this is a “ ” word games together , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now i have on the screen a animation function interact try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the children &apos;s felix . 
he could use some new add elements to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards a vote video animation images , can bring these new elements add to the animation . 
see , he added up to the sun . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
orange tractors . 
do good . 
in animation siftables to shake images that can bring new elements add to the image on his new element to add up -- 吠 dogs . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he was planning on how stories plot . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed siftables , the function of the sound domain , can produce 超载 like tone and bess and drum voice . 
there &apos;s every tiles 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put sound siftable tiles . the sound of the modules into siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there &apos;s this 响器 filter , which is a voice siftable work module . 
put this kind of tiles come close to sound can adjust the sound . 
so , we can use to control master rhythm and volume of the modules to edit siftable tiles siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
start with the 超载 put into the two tiles , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now 贝斯音 join . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now the acoustic tile near drums filter modules , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to just accelerated pace of the rhythm to edit tiles module . 
now let &apos;s put a voice to the tiles shellfish tiles sound filter . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so you don &apos;t need to have 编排 , but over time , based on play , but long and short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so -- thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and the technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
