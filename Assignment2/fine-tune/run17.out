and through pictures purpose rapture story , a national geographic by wade davis explorers of the aboriginal culture celebrate diversity , these extraordinary culture is an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are all born into 母腹 and 生儿育女 in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl , sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 苦楚 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture song rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different mind makes you want to see 
the world 五彩缤纷 犹如 culture , by a mental life and culture life intertwined , and the internet to cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also a strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
by the biosphere as big as race circles are facing the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet , that &apos;s 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is shining human spirit . 
and it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a mind a conscious and a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and all of our population in the audience as much half of language , no longer to teach kids 
these language has 传人 didn &apos;t do that unless it works they will completely gone . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be the last 本族语 that people can &apos;t tell the wisdom of ancestors for kids don &apos;t predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race about race loop loop give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people have forgot . i said “ different ” way of living in front of me said “ ” different ways . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 northwest part of the played methuselah -- they &apos;re called 蚺 that the race because they believe in a time that they 米尔克 from the sacred river 东岸 was used for . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of the forest floor , so they 栖身 in their 天穹 , with the forest canopy , and no difference . 
they said in a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that as a linguistics 异族 通婚 to the people with a different languages , married people . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon 婚 异族 because of the reason it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i was exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had to peace . 
five years , trying to missionary 1957 to them , but these people made a fatal mistake . 
they from the sky 十张 eight to leave their himself in the picture , we think it &apos;s kind of that , but they don &apos;t think of this 雨林中 live in the people who &apos;ve never seen a two-dimensional . 
from the forest , they pick up these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people , but what they found that person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears and five missionary 戮 died . 
more terrifying 华拉尼 is not only 戮 at people . 
and they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of the population was their 戮 to die . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 两例 found only natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , truth of the more it will 年迈 to wood , they &apos;ll 戮 he 送终 for him . 
the other hand , they have astonishing for bush 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell 40 a predator several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religious voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
christianity , islam , there &apos;s some other buddhist religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between . 
in the living soul . 
and the rhythm of dance with 翩翩起舞 can 大水 below the soul to just replace the soul of life in the short shining 侍僧成 moment for god . 
so voodoo believers , like to say you go to church worship to call god . 
we dance to be in the temple . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
and i have to have all of life in the northern columbia 玛尔塔 科基人 the mountains of the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization descent , they were once conquered and takes over the columbia the coast in plain 此后 them back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent this race has never been the spaniards . 
and to today , they 续 along with monk would rule , but they monk 训诫 very unique 
they like 母腹 back to those groups are taught the values that maintain the values is the relationship between the believers , and we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s the beauty of how you want to protect it . 
they call myself for 弟兄 兄长 call we say we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to learn , very important . 
aboriginal people will not 多愁善感 don &apos;t have 思乡 of torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain shelter , or god is a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s important for meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia , grew up with the people on the mind , i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll see that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this photo was me last year in august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia 徒 萨满教 plants to use it died on water -- making psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain with five 羟 -- which is very close to 成份 . 
jamie tribes 亚诺马 people will have from five 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you take a sip powder in these hallucinations , you &apos;ll see 光怪陆离 in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you were totally wiped out , but not distorted 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they will be the organ in a single 氧化酶 is called the enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have to change and oral 氧化酶 is one of the other chemicals live . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that in there -- 藤本植物 β 咔 啉 right to control and alone is 氧化酶 to color is the potency of 不由得 so you have to ask ourselves 
when we do all kinds of experiments constantly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is all they &apos;re in deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , and i said , is not about 
i tell you that if they said in the circle months in the night , and each of plants that grow in different little , singing to you . 
it &apos;s not going to see you get harvard ph.d. accounting 报表 than , but it is more fun . 
dh : now we have this question , and some of our compassion something indigenous people think they 离群索居 丰富多彩 living world forward , but as we develop these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been by new way of life as a strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is great sioux nation indians and americans 骑马 to go and sit still 马车 life and the united states . 
the threat race 完整性 layer is not change or technological innovation itself , it &apos;s a power line all he was barbaric . 
we look at the mountains tibet recently where i do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide . it &apos;s cultural destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce , in many places it even be a part of this by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other together fled to nepal . 
his mother 富农 because 成份 关押 were and family . 
he was only two , and he put his mother 悄悄地 hidden dress and bring him into his because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and 学习班 into being . 
one day she didn &apos;t have hair has to be on the face of 臂章 and be guilty about seven years of a nation to accept 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to take the human spirit redemption need access to witness 
and we &apos;re going to have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need to a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
think about it , we have in the world exist in the 10,000 year it will make you feel guilty . 
新石器 revolution in agriculture , human time to time , we seed , he went to the top of the girl 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra for 祭 cheese that we create a level of 社会分工 . it &apos;s 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
and i think this brief history was enough to make the future , we have the ability to solve the challenges facing . 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to recognize that we have to make sure that all race , and all of those organisms 昌盛 for life . 
this is a picture i 巴芬岛 in the northern part of the mountain . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 whale call that the people i go to a about his grandfather legendary story . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always practice inuit people to build our sovereign states that we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old man to move . 
his family worrying about security , and he put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , this is their day alone thick . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he &apos;s slept in outside wearing his seal 长裤 skin his hands to pull the stool when stool quickly become stiff , he made it into a blades . 
and in this shit to make a blades 口水 on the edge , and then it becomes very frozen solid , he used it to 刀子 宰杀 dog . 
the dogs bark 剥 挽具 and then he made a dog made out of his dog sleds condoms to another between when that don &apos;t have to put it in shit made of ice sheet . 
this is really 空手 make life . 
in many ways . this is inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 canada government to a area than texas and california 之和 area of land back to the big returned to inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do something with it managed to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , i think the world for ever on a remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a 族类 home . 
they represent branches of human imagination , go back to the origin of the ancient times for all of our people dream of these kids and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make . 
we think jt debate is not to convince other people , but we think , by tell it to make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s at about the institutions , our website , as a click of thousands of five 百万次 to three 
we 156 channels in a country play 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from the internet . use pick out the picture static photosynth , created an absolute brute dream of view , and can navigate it . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
here we see is many many gb 千兆 and byte . level of digital photographs , and they can do for smooth and mapping zoom in , you can browse them by the way , you can do to rearrange them . 
it can see how many images of data , how big the image , and how much seadragon , all have this ability to deal with . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference because our system of performance , the only factor is just , you use the screen like 素数 seadragon . and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of data . 
this is what he dickens 山庄 , &quot; and &quot; 荒凉 line is chapter of content . 
i &apos;ll give you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be a reading an electronic book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture of 张大 opening . 
and the paper , or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people will get better reading experience , to enjoy the joy of reading . 
here we made it a little change in &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture advertising than this -- you just see the normal advertising higher resolution , embedded in a lot of pictures of the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to actually use a screen area limits . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and this information . 
obviously , with this technology with digital maps , it &apos;s obvious one of the applications . 
so , i really don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field of our contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
and get 叠加 to deal with the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually by two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is another graduate from the university of washington snavely noah undertake computer visual research findings . this research and get seitz steve washington university . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got applied seadragon , it &apos;s based on technology building . 
you can see , we have access to have multiple ways of looking at pictures and images , to make the 剖析 subtlety and have more resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of sense than this space to strong . 
mainly because when we make site , to take care of to a lot of legal issues . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by 串联 up in space . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this welcome , really quite amazing happy . 
i think you can see the these images from a lot of different cell phone camera : from the camera into a single . so a lot of different quality images , in this environment was all put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
i remember here , there should be a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can effectively internet community with everyone . we can start to get everyone to different data environment memory , collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , have a much more than just to collect it all . 
however , what this model out , is the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler &quot; virtual earth &quot; long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
the user , be 注 you picture the labels . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years from around the world will 接合 pictures together ? 
is this software . that &apos;s the real meaning to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this process is completely 接合 based on the content of the picture . 
more exciting is that picture contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , what you &apos;re in the picture , the key word later , the web to have a lot of text with this picture that information . 
now , suppose you all of these pictures and images being , that would be like ? 
now , so these semantic information to each other inside of links , and is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think here to talk about this book , i hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a recognized the creed of about it . 
well , what the standard ? 
that &apos;s the western 笃信 疑 industrial society is not a principles . 
well , this is to say this : if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is it that freedom with itself is good , valuable , for what they need to . 
and once people had freedom , each of us can 做主 ourselves with all the way the big enough to get people to welfare , don &apos;t they 做主 for me . 
and the freedom to make a lot to do is the largest increase selective limits . 
people more choices , it &apos;s more freedom , freedom , getting more and more that welfare . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that deep-rooted that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives of . 
let me give you some examples of modern society at the progress of development we become possible to do something . 
this is my house , near a supermarket . not very big . 
i just want to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and then you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system is much couldn &apos;t count . 
with this store components , you can 650万种 close with a different combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer to phone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s not going to die all bad . 
that are 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially cell phones . now , that cartoons . 
these are the mobile phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 that will mp three play -- with a machine , cutting hair and french 焦糖 布丁 火枪 in . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , it doesn &apos;t take long , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store , and you ask : is there a with so many function ? &quot; 
you want , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
“ answer is no ” . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phone . 
again , in life in more than the other shopping to affect the things we have the bang , this is the same . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , who straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail solutions are very and risk . 
and so forth 乙 solutions are very and risk ? how do you want to treat . 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
they said , again , there are these things and risk nail 乙 , there are those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , that you choose ” ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for you and me , and the ordinary people . if you think about it , it &apos;s said . and since we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why are they doing marketing campaign to us ? 
they want to answer is , we looked at the morning after advertising would go to your doctor , to the doctor to call the prescription drugs , put in them . 
now , as we gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice . it &apos;s like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now we gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by ourselves to invent . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you today , you &apos;re going to do a kind of men and women -- and make decisions . 
in marriage family ways , in the last everybody to age that got married , that &apos;s almost as a result , and the thing is 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who &apos;s got married , and it &apos;s not what you see , it &apos;s not married , after what to do . 
and now , about everything that can take 拣 挑拣 pick . 
i teach a bunch of good and bright students , but now i give them all placed homework fifth time less than one . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever students -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re thinking , are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask myself , i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is it is now ? 
and after that first ? i &apos;m trying to kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do i all placed homework , whether they in my class take a what grades . 
they really should go to these problems , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day , any time in the earth in a corner work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this restaurant , where did have a wifi can , but i don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible choice freedom to us is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , to work for themselves , now it &apos;s about and the rest . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 with all the mobile phone , another 裤兜 in with all their blackberry and blackberry . the lap , and the laptops . 
even though they &apos;re off , we are looking at in 场上 rivals for children and constantly ask myself , i &apos;m not for the telephone ? 
back to this email or not ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this was 信稿 ? 
even if you give yourself the answer is no , you have children and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a little thing issue of matter , it &apos;s way of life , life is choice . 
we used to live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world , like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
first of all , it says something paradox , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us is not liberation , but box , is paralysis . 
so many people have the choice to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is about a project for pension investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to vanguard investment record . vanguard is a big support fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
her research that is , when those customers and their employees to provide a fund -- the increase of every 10 to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 fund , down 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that that &apos;s even more difficult is not so you put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , preferably tomorrow &apos;s , of course , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
don &apos;t wait to this plan for a year , they make more 5千元 up to the employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 employer . that was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , it &apos;s too many choices are paralyzed rigid . 
and it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make that decision is the right , right ? 
there you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation , or wrong is salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
more choices , the more easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make decisions . 
secondly , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today dan gilbert . about a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice can think about it , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you gave up to attract people aspect . and that makes you always chosen to you that 美中不足 think . 
let me give you an example -- and shows comics , but if you are not new yorker , if i have a 歉 . 
but this is right now , you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
gorgeous beach , 明媚 sunlight , they have all this . 
can better than that ? it &apos;s now to “ huh , they &apos;re really bad , ” “ ” , in august now . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home ” . 
“ is i &apos;m going to go back to the car stop in my own front ” . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost percent and the good parking opportunity . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let us to have to make a decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in that it &apos;s more , and all these things became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also say the “ ” now live in this sense . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but one of them is , it is , when you chose to do something , and that you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing you tend to have a lot of places , and will undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and third , 增高 expectations . 
this point in time , i have to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time , enough to wash the times , and then get 凑合 pants . 
so , in this pants for many years old , i finally 上街 to buy the new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and said , you have to type , comfort 紧身 type , was 宽松 for ? 
it &apos;s in front of 扣子 to pull locked 石磨 ? or is acid wash ? 
that come to a broken ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i ask “ , i &apos;m going to that was the only kind of pattern ” . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it is worse . 
why ? why this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is , because there are so many sex , i can choose for a jeans what should have good to be a good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is a , so much , i didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the best at least have a 极致 is perfect . 
and that &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i have , i had to , and i want to do , and i expect more than this one up , i became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except that improve people what to do a lot of good outside expectations didn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just to make people and less happy , even though it &apos;s a good results . 
there &apos;s nobody to market understand this , because if they sense . there &apos;s people understand it , you don &apos;t have to know what this is the idea . i mean cartoons . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in all these things are bad past everything better than now . 
and the reason why is that when one of the things that are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every one of the things that you only hope than you would expect , it &apos;s not bad . 
you will never be , because you know what , what i than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so now you a little bit of time . i want to talk about myself , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 no , i try . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now in the store , there are hundreds of jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
out there on the jeans , hundreds of the things that you have no excuse f it up . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re good to decide -- is so disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world and the developed world -- clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
and the net effect , even though the objective is we do better than ever before , but they don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
i remind you . 
this now to bring happiness -- the standard principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . it &apos;s not right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a key value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond the ‘ choice ’ rich , and we need to the critical value . 
i said it quickly . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that has so much choice is matter , a rich . 
we have a lot of the world where , at least , we heard a few of those problems , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so here i talk about this topic is modern western societies , on a particular problem . 
steve 里维特 . yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we make the expensive and to operate the car seats , just in 于事无补 waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is the expensive and complicated choice is not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us harm . 
they actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 thomas improve practice . 
redistribution products to all of that , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of the problems we like a plague of extra . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position “ said , huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in this fish in everything is impossible ” . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think , the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs this “ ” fish . 
in this fish and -- you know , for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means suffering is going to , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from the numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life ” “ , i think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we have to almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from a biological mimic analysis entered the world , the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to question , if we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome in the lab to make it replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 from the genes that we 一百组 separate out in front of this . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue to question the basic problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never make a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , by the way down , don &apos;t live is just some sort of chemicals . 
we constantly digital life in the pace of exponential speed . 
we write the code is capable of progress , very slowly , but it still increasing . in our recent is going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
in fact , it through the stages . and when we do for the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna , length in 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , long time , i made a mistake , the more and more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together and it all wrong . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 genome and bacteriophage -- to digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the most exciting stage is when we put this video there live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles and back to kill the e. coli 革 and 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some of the oil industry , and i think they communicate this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this is actually in this software can build a biological system in their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that this digital information has to be very accurate . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , right , gene sequencing is every 10,000 basic standard for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , on average , in sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence , set of genes that could never have turned on . 
design work is part of the piece of design 50 character and the other 50 character long 叠加 pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design that they can together . 
and one of the unique part of that we design . 
you may have heard about in which we add 水印 . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 the body -- and these scripts 编成 about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and can use enzyme 裁 to cut . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started building pieces , from 7000 character length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character length of time and pull 几组 merger , at a time , people long time . 
in every stage , we grow a piece of these , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very , very reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to reach the level of the automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 of . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 people , basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in the long coil e. longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation 球菌 microbes is able to withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosome . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original form . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these are to be completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is the mentioned yeast way and put it in the right after we design pieces . yeast automatically , will they aggregates . 
this is not an electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
these are , long about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than 580000 character long gene code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10号 in helvetica , it will print out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we launched a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously with a virus is a very simple process bacteria more complicated . 
like ourselves with this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a tucked into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they came to the 连成 cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole transplant cells from the chromosome from one to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we try to bring this process design into some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve all had a second chromosomes species or from other parts of the third side chromosomes , in a second increased 数千种 new feature to its own . 
the original by what people in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes is to digest dna . 
the original cells have this enzyme without this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize another a genome is no matter , it &apos;s going to it , and finally , we have a has a new dna . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original species for all disappeared , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells ” “ new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , actually , is that we put into it . 
this might sound like 炼金术 genes , but we really can move through dna , and to radically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to every single one of us from 1946 is ; the people in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use the coal , 300多亿桶 50亿顿 over oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this program , or any organisms can replace it program , it &apos;s a big challenge . 
and then , of course , is that the material that was the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now have found from around the world has a 两千万组 about genes database , and i like to see them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only the electric industry , and look for a components that can get diversity . 
now , our main limit from reality biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can make “ we call the mixing ” group of fast synthetic way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day , the chromosomes . 
and this is just standard choice . we can start to survive , to choose , chemical production , or fuel vaccine production , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit at work in the computer really use software to design the design of the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code , they look like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 ” fuel . 
you see the recent corn ethanol is going into a bad experiment . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it was sugar into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep sea . about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the environment . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen methane , carbon dioxide molecules into the its energy source . 
if we look at the two to collect what &apos;s really , really convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase the &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have 化工 with the whole oil industry , the little target . now -- if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we are using the same tool making a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see this year &apos;s flu , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is what the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species of bacteria , which is really the 古物 and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this ted u 09年 speak in the short , brian cox : which shares some super 对撞机 news . content , including are now to repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said it back to give you an update on to the machine running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t to last year , the lhc . is in the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
it &apos;s ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these big bang some camera to little detector . 
this is i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas of building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last september 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters particles around a picture of all the way down the lhc . we &apos;re planning to as part of the lhc . and , in a lot of particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know , this is getting 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people go to google , saw that graph is front page . 
this suggests that we work with this shock to a culture of it as a shock . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the main 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they started machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do that , because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 into . 
so in less than planet 271摄氏度 below the temperature of the space between the case of these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 电磁铁 九千多个 in in a 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of transmission 安培 current they and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them back to the ground . 
in three 月底 refer to be about the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in july , six , get data and continue our mission to find out that the universe , basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents 激化 to a cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still want my with the fact is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

they &apos;re very depression , came to me and said , “ . you don &apos;t you ? not afraid of this in my life is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s really going to comfort people ! 
i was around with the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ?

yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , the fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? but , the fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ?

and i , myself , believed that it brings me to 绝境 dark , and i , myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , especially in my career stage right now , especially in my career so far . 
you see , i was young , i come to 40 years old , you see , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for career 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say is , in my heart , and this is probably in my life , this is the biggest successes is over . 
oh my god , this is what the idea .

in some way , i have to build a safe distance themselves from the writing , and i work for the open outcry extreme anxiety writing itself , and i work for responses extreme anxiety . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient , hear me , because we end up around the back . 
in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human 
people believe , creativity is a sacred djinn from distant and not to know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know from distant and the goal is to know where the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with the djinn “ for creativity to 守护神 ” 
and for people to think that there &apos;s a socrates 守护神 from a distance , wisdom and gives him for people to think that there &apos;s a socrates 守护神 , from a distance to give him wisdom 
ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius djinn “ called ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create djinn “ called ” genius 
this is wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i find in the safe distance , and that &apos;s what makes people from 成败 work on protecting mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
by the artist protection , and get this idea of avoid the narcissism ancient artist by this idea and get to protect , excessive narcissism . 
if you work great , it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass “ ” geniuses work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is westerners in the last very long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual for me , it &apos;s too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of the self cognitive , and for people to expand expect that something was completely straight up twisted , one of the self cognitive , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists kill , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years countless artist . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think , is this so we now the question is : how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 better off the ideas we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 off 500多年 rational human development of ideas . 
well , maybe i could not convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make people believe in you &apos;ve all had to sit in that experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense

and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 that , and then i tried to try and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 that , and then i tried to . 
and i lift the manuscript , to an empty room of the manuscript , and i looked up and , to one of the room . 
“ because you can see , i &apos;ve shot for the committed no kept ” “ because you can see , i &apos;ve shot for the committed ” . no . 
“ if you want this book better , it &apos;s now your turn that part of them , do you work ” . 
if you don &apos;t “ to help , that you see the to ” . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because it &apos;s my job . &quot; 
today , i hope that the historical record 尽责 : i 坚守 to my jobs € today , i hope that the historical record 尽责 : i 坚守 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , although rarely see , but actually happens when a dancer , going beyond when the 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
time to stop , dancers like across the time to stop , across the dancer , like , what he did . and before the 1000场 performance , and no difference , but everything was amazingly unified up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human his life , from the inside , light , light from the bottom , he was sacred shine . 
and people , clearly know what it is , they can make it was called the name of the people , clearly know what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some incredible wondrous for , people will 喝彩 “ : arturo la , 欧 嘞 嘞 欧 , oh , la , really great , excellent ” incredible , which is good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most intractable is the next morning , 悠悠 dancers to turn up for artists , the most intractable is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on a tuesday morning that was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
it &apos;s just that when bad leg , are going to the old people , and he might , you couldn &apos;t get last night that altitude . 
maybe no longer there will be in his dance 喝彩 , god with him from good , there are going to do ? 
this is a very tricky issues , and it &apos;s creative process , one of the self cognitive . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most painful process of self , understanding of this is a very tricky issues , and it &apos;s creative process , one of the self cognitive . 
but maybe we would have pain , so if you were never thought , that wonderful work of art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful work of art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
if you didn &apos;t , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs , i still 喝彩 嘞 欧 : for you . 
if you didn &apos;t , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs , i still 喝彩 嘞 欧 : for you . 
and i believe that we have to teach the idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
at ted in 2009 , al gore shows the new situation , global climate trend that &apos;s more than scientists to worry about that , and he “ for ” clean coal . 
al gore for recently climate trends . 
last year , i was about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the area of the equivalent of south america by 48 state 缩减 40 percent of the area . 
but they can &apos;t completely that this question . because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s a good global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer 舒张 heart heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is 冻 permanent ice 
you see , it &apos;s in a dark blue is that every winter form of the year in summer , ice 冻 permanent ice . 
what “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five or more long ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood 各部 guy in the body to move . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect 受热 冻土 around the arctic ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of 冻 by an carbon and 干冰 解冻 -- when methane , carbon microbes compost . 
now , if the dots , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the light in alaska in the lake has can see the 沼气 探头 water . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter 结队 professor to a light lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
the reason , there &apos;s a sink , which is a heat heating . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it has to 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of how to make ice melts , sea levels rising 入海口 here it is . 
here are 急速 in traffic . 
the other side of the earth , the largest ice on the planet . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s on 20 feet of sea level , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world from the financial water get half of the water . 
in the ice 安第斯 mountains , this is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , and we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you can see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
it &apos;s dry in the world to fire in numbers . 
and the number of disasters , it &apos;s quite unprecedentedly in absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years in time , to the earlier 总数 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
every day in the last five years we 七千万吨 increasing co2 emissions 两千五百万吨 co2 to the oceans . 
look at the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
greenhouse effect of the biggest reason of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil fuel is 20 percent . 
oil , coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution is to build a used to use more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political war . 
carbon and oil and coal industries , last year , spent 两千五百万美元 appeal to clean coal that &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
before and after christmas , in my hometown of tennessee digging up of billions of 淤泥 coal . 
you probably saw in the news . 
here , is the second largest put water up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
this is a coal carbon industry . 
coal mr. cool is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive economy , and he helped us . 
coal mr. cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , the coal 产地 
most of the coal mining &apos;s head of massey 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and now one of the president of two project started . 
this is one part of one of them . 
coalergy in very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of explaining the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , coal not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , don &apos;t have to worry about , and for global warming . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal factory . 
喧哗 some spectacular machine . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal to global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , the climate crisis 
will the crisis is strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products on like dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solution to this problem . 
america repower with 100 percent clean electricity with a time . 
the new work to get people to our lives more safe , and it &apos;s not in the warming . 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
america repower know more . 
the last one . 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old dirty oil are murder our planet , and this is something we reduce it to rely on the fastest way . 
the future is here . wind and solar energy , a new network . 
in the new big create more money . 
repower . it &apos;s time to america &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go away , and fast . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables show -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember about being a kid in when you played kit . 
when you design and how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is something that is to understand and 空间结构 perception . 
understand that 空间结构 really helps us to around a lot of learning things . 
and that question would be in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so to have this siftables will . 
simple siftable to say , with a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
siftables can use my hands just move , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information with tools . 
with this tool , more independent , more sensitive to each other senses , feel any with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
there &apos;s this siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe , then images in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables perception to each other . 
if you give them a 挨 out a good , interesting is going to happen . 
and if you have a bunch of them , they &apos;re also aware , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves with each other , maybe . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use siftables and interact with gestures , like a liquid that put down from a different color siftable into a siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there &apos;s three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put these colors pour water in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it more , you can go back and some . 
siftables and learning a function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 faster , see the results . 
this is my siftables here to show you why -- and applause . this is a simple equation , i use a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble boggle and remix word games together . 
this together . we play a game like the , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together of words , it will be in the dictionary siftables automatically find words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spelling out to change the sequence shows up , the right word , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
so now . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , that &apos;s some kids are in the media lab because siftables in the test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in play this game together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , and this is a “ ” word games together , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the lower right-hand corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just wanted to siftables of together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now i have on the screen a animation function interact try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the child &apos;s felix . 
he can put some new add elements to animation image , what he does is to take up to the table siftables towards animation images put a video , can bring these new elements add to the animation . 
see , he added up to the sun . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
in animation siftables to shake images that can bring new elements to add to the new element . he put up -- 吠 dogs . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he was planning on how stories plot . 
sitting cat balloon off . 
and i &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function and 编排 in , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed siftables , the function of the sound domain , can produce 超载 like the and bess and the sound of a drum . 
every tiles for change , but there &apos;s 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put sound siftable tiles . the sound of the modules into siftable by the way you like . 
to put sound just come close to sound editors module . 
there &apos;s something like a 响器 sound filter , which works siftable module . 
put this kind of come close to sound tiles can adjust sound . 
so , we can use to control and rhythm and volume siftable tiles near the end of the modules siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
the first started 超载 put into the two tiles , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now , in some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles drums modules , that you can adjust sound . 
i &apos;m going to rhythm just put up some tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now , and then bring a voice to the tiles tiles shellfish filter voice . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have 编排 , but over time , based on play , but long and short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with the volume tiles near the tiles on the left , in this place . 
so now . thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we &apos;re doing in the lab . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and the technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
