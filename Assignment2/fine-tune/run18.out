rapture images and stories through it , the national geographic explorers by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are all born into 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 life that we create 苦楚 art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these communities show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send the different perspectives will let you see hope 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture and intertwined life to cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important point as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity -- that &apos;s what we have a strong as the ability to look at the species . 
in biosphere by severe around in circles like also facing the same shorter and its destruction faster 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet have used 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is the human spirit shining 
it &apos;s all a unique culture in more than the physical world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we all the same number of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no meaning to 传人 unless it works they will completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be talking final 本族语 people can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t allowed to predict the future of how this would be lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i &apos;m going to do is take you to explore this race loop loop race to give you a rough and understand what makes you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people who have already forgot . i said “ different way of living ” i mentioned “ ” different ways . 
for example this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 played methuselah -- the areas that they &apos;re called the 蚺 race because they believe in a time where they came from the river 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 forest , and so , in their opinion 天穹 with the forest canopy . no . 
they say , with a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that as a 通婚 异族 went to the people with a different languages married . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . there &apos;s always a 大家族 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
when i was exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing race in 1958 years earlier , i used to that they had to peace . 
1957 missionary five years to approach them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the sky eight to 10 十张 they himself in the photo we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think that live in 雨林中 people have never seen a two-dimensional . 
from the forest , they pick up these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people , but the person they found nothing . and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 dead that five evangelist . 
more terror is not only 华拉尼 戮 external people died . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent mortality population was their 戮 dead people . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally goes out to the truth is it going to be more 年迈 wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
in addition to the forest , they have astonishing 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell predator 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
a voodoo unique about it is in life , and connection between them . 
born in the soul . 
the dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 below the soul to just replace the soul of life in the short time for 侍僧成 shining . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re cathedral to dance . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
i was exposed to all of those groups in colombia of living in the mountains of santa 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient civilization tyranny of descent , they were once conquered and filled out the columbia coast in plain 此后 they go back to the coast plains of an isolated . 
in this bloody continent 肆虐 this race has never been the spaniards . 
and today , they get along with 续 monk would rule institutions , but they monk 训诫 very unique . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain these values , and with the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful that you need to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 call us for 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that it doesn &apos;t matter . 
it &apos;s a symbol that means the people &apos;s relationship with nature . 
i was in british columbia as the jungles of local people &apos;s thoughts . i think is going to be cut down in the woods . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this is a picture of me this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 dead on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often used it did die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent of color , it is in the brain with five 羟 color is the 成份 very close . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribes are going to start with five -- 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you use a nose sucked into powder that you &apos;ll see 光怪陆离 hallucinations in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distort it were totally wiped out 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organ that one is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have must also oral change is a single 氧化酶 living as any chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that this kind of 藤本植物 there -- β 咔 啉 right is going to be able to control 氧化酶 and play the color is so potent you 不由得 to ask myself . 
when we do all kinds of experiments keep making errors measure it . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is they &apos;re all in the jungle in what we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to the plant hierarchy is how they say , i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not for plants have something to say it &apos;s not about me . 
so i told you , if they said in months circle of the things that night 17 grow every plant to use the different little word singing to you . 
and that &apos;s not going to get your ph.d. from harvard , but it &apos;s much more 报表 calculus is more fun . 
dh : now we have this question , and some of us indigenous compassion tragedy think they live 离群索居 丰富多彩 world forward , but as we develop these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been new way of life as strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is the great sioux nation and americans 骑马 people to go and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat ethnic loop 完整性 is not change or technological innovation , it &apos;s the power of all the words , he &apos;s robust . 
let &apos;s look at of tibet recently where i made a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide endangered cultures , which is destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce in many places it even be a part of this by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese people immediately , he was killed . 
his uncle and other fled together into nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family and 成份 by 关押 . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and was sent to 学习班 . 
one day she accidentally hit has to have hair &apos;s head of the 臂章 and being a nation of guilty about seven years to 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to take the human spirit redemption need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
we have to think , in the world exist in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 revolution of human to go to the top of the agricultural age we seed girl erotic 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra of cheese 祭 for us to create a level of into this 社会分工 only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to make our future will be able to solve the challenges facing 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the top . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people to tell me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the 1950s , the government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old man refused to move . 
his family worried that his security put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , which is their days alone , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he slept outside wearing his skin his 长裤 seal to pull stool in hand when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this to a shit blades puke on the edge and 口水 frozen after it becomes very robust and then he did it take 刀子 宰杀 dog . 
the next 剥 dogs bark into a 挽具 he and his dog made out of a dog sleds to another between when you don &apos;t put it on a shit knife in ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 make life . 
in many ways . it &apos;s inuit people all the world &apos;s indigenous 顽强 real 写照 resilience . 
april 1999 canada government to a than texas and california area of the land area 之和 and returned back to inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called le new dimension , 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is very good example , a country that can make a difference to think about how to fix it , and the relationship between people . 
and finally , i think in the world ever some remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent branch of human imagination dates back to the origin of the ancient times for all of us , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and tv can do is we believe that politicians do not . 
we think dh : debate is not to convince people , but we think about it and get to make the world , so we can change the world &apos;s at about the institutions of our website click of a month for about three to five 百万次 thousands of 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have a million people . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from online picky . using a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and it can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
we see here is so many many gb 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can do for and smooth zoom in , you can browse them by the way the larger context , can do to rearrange them . 
no matter how data can see , there &apos;s a lot of pictures and images themselves , how much seadragon all have that kind of processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system , the only thing is : you can use the screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of data . 
this is what the dickens had 荒凉 山庄 line , &quot; is chapter of content . 
i &apos;ll give you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 is a picture of the opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains proportion of the images , in reading , when people get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in the issues to &quot; the guardian &quot; corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture ads -- that you see longer than average ad to a lot of high resolution , the picture embedded in the extra content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
the way to an extent screen avoid the actual use body size . 
we want this technology will reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , with digital maps , of course , it &apos;s one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field for your contribution . 
these are just the nasa geospatial basis . 
to deal with 叠加 and get the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merge with two different techniques . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from graduate school at the university of washington noah snavely undertake computer visual research findings . it &apos;s got at the university of washington steve seitz 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got application , it &apos;s based on technology seadragon building . 
you can see , we have access to do with multiple ways of looking at , and to do with subtlety 剖析 and have the resolution of reading experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping environment . 
there are lots of examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , going to take care of the law . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by in space 串联 up . 
and then , so that we can easily go to do . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
this is pretty amazing , to really happy . 
i think you can see that these images from the many different camera phone camera , from one to the professional backwards . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment are put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors 大头 contains the pictures , etc . 
i remember this should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to go to the poster in their environment . 
the point here is that &apos;s how we can use effectively online community with everyone . we can get to data for each different environmental memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , have a much more than just to collect it up . 
this model is a crime , the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
user picture , you will be 注 tag on . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years will come from the picture of 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software is really , is to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this 接合 process is completely based on the content of the picture . 
more exciting images that contains a lot of text information semantic . 
for example , you go online and with that picture , the key word later , the web is going to have a lot of text with this picture that information . 
now , suppose you all these pictures and images together , that would be like ? 
now , so these semantic information to each other in links and will be a tremendous . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
barry 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about this book part of what i hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know exactly what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a recognized principles of the story . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 疑 笃信 principles . 
well , this is to say , if we allow people to get the benefits of big enough , the way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is this thing in free and was good and valuable , for people are essential . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can themselves with 做主 way of the big enough to get welfare , people don &apos;t have to work for me were 做主 . 
and the freedom to do a lot to do is on the largest increase selective . 
people more choices , it &apos;s more freedom , freedom , getting more and more that welfare . 
i think , like the idea 掺 into the water that the age-old that nobody would want to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples of modern society &apos;s advance development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
i just want to talk about this salad ingredients . 
you see , it &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one to store it a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s this one in a pop-up stores sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
with this store components that you can have last 650万种 out of the things pop-up sound system . 
you can &apos;t don &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , i &apos;m talking about communication . 
i was a kid , you were just refer to phone service , which had to go to the bell , just a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , the telephone is going to die don &apos;t all bad . 
that are 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially mobile . now , it is . 
these are the phone . 
and i &apos;d 津津乐道 in the middle of it will take three mp -- the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t on your right next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , it doesn &apos;t last very long , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store and said , &quot; have you don &apos;t have a without so much function ? &quot; 
you want , answer would be ? 
answer is no “ ” . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a not so many things stem cell phone . 
similarly , living in some other shopping for more than we affect the things that have the same up there . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , doctors straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail . there are things and risk . 
and so forth . there &apos;s 乙 things and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , i should do ” how ? 
the psychiatrist says , again , a nail these things , and risk 乙 have those things and risk . 
how are you going to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
now the prescription drugs , over the ad is for you and me . the ordinary people , if you think about it , it &apos;s saying , if we can &apos;t think a can &apos;t go to buy 柜台 . 
why should we do to promote market ? 
answer is , they wanted us to see the morning after the advertising would go to your doctor on the phone , and they put the prescription drugs put in them . 
now as our gender identity that kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now our gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by ourselves to invent . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you today , you &apos;re going to do a kind of men and women -- and make decisions . 
the marriage of families in the past everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is of course , and that &apos;s 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing that you need the choices and who is getting married , rather than when you see , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and today , about everything that can take 挑拣 拣 pick . 
i teach a bunch of smart bright students , but now i gave them all placed homework time less than one fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever before -- students stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always asking myself , i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is it going right now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to first child , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do all placed my homework , whether they in my class . take a grades . 
they really need to think about these issues , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day , any time on this planet at work in the corner -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place to wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you are . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also wanted to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible freedom to bring us is we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for ourselves to do was to break hanging around . 
we go to kid play football , a 裤兜 with all the mobile phone , another 裤兜 installed in with their blackberry &#91; knee &#93; blackberry , and with the laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we still looking at in 场上 rivals for children and kept asking myself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to the email or not ? i don &apos;t have to write this an 信稿 ? 
if you give their answer is no , you have children . it was called experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether thing was , small things matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we live in the world like this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world is this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me tell you that bad of beauty . 
all these choices for people who are affected two , two and a negative impact . 
one , said something like an oxymoron , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us not liberating , but inside , is paralysis . 
with so many choices that people want to make a decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a about peer-to-peer pension plan investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest vanguard record . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund company , with about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
her research that &apos;s when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is about two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 fund 10 percent , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to choose to decide that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s preferably , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make a lot about the 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , the more likely to have the results were numb rigid . 
and it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make that decision is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where do you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation is wrong , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the more likely to puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make decisions . 
secondly , economists call opportunity cost “ ” things . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have many options consider that they &apos;re easy to imagine that you quit to attract people aspect . and that makes you always chosen to you that think 美中不足 . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is now you should think about that . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
it could be better than that ? this is where it thinking “ huh , really , poor ” “ are now in august , ” . 
manhattan “ neighbors were not home , ” 
i &apos;m going to “ is back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was such an idea torture , and in every day 念叨 lost percent better chance in the parking . 
“ opportunity cost ” always has enabled us to make a decision not even with these decisions are actually 英明 . 
we have options more attractive in these options that are more , and all these things became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also say out in the present whatsoever “ ” this principle . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , in a sense is , when you chose to do something , and you just have chosen not to do other things . 
the other things tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time i went to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to wash over a million times , pants to become 凑合 . 
so , this in many years old , i finally pants 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and said , you have to type 紧身 , comfort , and it &apos;s 宽松 for ? 
the first to 扣子 and drag locked ? 石磨 and acid wash ? 
you just a quick them ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i said , i &apos;m going to “ that was the only one ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i can take a me the most 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is because there are so many sex , i can choose for a jeans what should have good to be greatly good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i didn &apos;t expect a lot . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least a is the best 极致 perfect . 
it &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i want to do , and i expect more than i wake up , and it &apos;s just become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together , in addition to the right thing to improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond doesn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize and less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
and the market , there &apos;s nobody to understand this , because if they know there &apos;s a person , and you don &apos;t have the opportunity to know what is this idea . i mean cartoons . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in all these things are bad past everything is better than today . 
and the reason why is that when a where things are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every object the more you will only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
you will never be what surprises , because what you expect me than god or high . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so -- so i want to pull itself is a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans choices for you , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now obviously the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t make excuses that might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be good , and they were so disappointed to decide , though , to blame myself . 
in the past our generation , the industrialized world -- countries in the clinical depressing , in this explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this &#91; choose to bring happiness -- well , the standard , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but don &apos;t choose conclusion that more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we choose ‘ rich ’ needs the critical value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that have so many choices , is a rich matter . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least we heard a few of them , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;ll talk about this topic is modern western societies on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we make those expensive and it &apos;s the car seats , 于事无补 money is wasted . 
and i &apos;m going to say is the expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really has brought us harm . 
they &apos;re actually makes us from than before . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 improve and do it . 
products redistribution will allow all , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , the fish , know what ? 
tell you , in this fish , everything is ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you &apos;ve added is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs this fish “ ” . 
in this fish -- and you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from those numbers to a new code biological design stage , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , and it from a biological mimic analysis entered the world , the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , and mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 genes from the 一百组 separate out is that our very eyes . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study is the synthetic chromosomes , so we can change its components to continue to ask the fundamental problem . 
so we started walking along the way down to our “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never succeeded in molecular displayed ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
chromosome one , by the way down , just some live without sexual chemistry . 
our digital life constantly going up exponentially . . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it also accelerating . we recently , what &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact , it took me through the stages . when we did the first trial , before i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a regression process , long time , i made a mistake that much more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first attempt , phi x 174 genome from now -- bacteriophage digital information started . 
it &apos;s a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the most exciting period is when we put this video there we go live chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building the virus particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli &#91; 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , i think they this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this is actually software is able to build a biological system within our own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that those numbers to be very accurate information . 
when we first in 1995 , for this group , gene sequencing right is the standard per 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found was that sequence again , it &apos;s an average of 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of a piece of design 50 character and the other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units of time . we need to design before they get together . 
and one that we design the unique part . 
you may have heard about in which we &apos;ve added 水印 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 -- the body and the character 编成 about 20 amino acids every amino acids , that &apos;s a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we created these and fragmented can use to cut 裁 enzyme . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , 7000 character from the length of time to put them together make 24 , people ask the length of time to time and 几组 merger , a long time , at people . 
in every stage , we grow a piece of these , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece , over 100 people to basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to other ways . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation called microbes 球菌 can withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is the yeast mentioned way and put it in the right after we design pieces . yeast automatically aggregates get them . 
it &apos;s not an image microscopic ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
it &apos;s such a big molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
this is a long time about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
it &apos;s over 580000 character long genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface no distance , it will print out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is a very simple process bacteria more complicated . 
as we do something really that nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , and with the cells into 连成 , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole list of the chromosome from one cell move on to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process stop there . but we try to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve had a second of all species or from elsewhere in the third side , one second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception of biological ignoring the realities . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digesting the dna . 
what cells chromosome without this enzyme enzyme without it , and when we add in a have this enzyme chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it &apos;s going to it , and finally , we have a contains a new dna . 
we put in gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original characteristics of all species disappear , and completely into a new species , based on our cells and put it in the new software “ ” . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , is that we actually put into it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we did get through dna , to move to dramatically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of big life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we put people in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to each of us from 1946 , who is in the next 40 years , the became four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
nine billion people to change that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about the biological process or any can replace it program , it would be a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material that was the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
and we found from around the world . there &apos;s a contains about 两千万组 genetic database , and i like to see them as the design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to kind of components , let &apos;s get this diversity . 
now , our main limited from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can make we call the mixing “ group ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to build a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is just standard choice . we can start to survive to choose , or chemical production , the fuel production , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit down , really work in the computer to design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what their genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it &apos;s sugar into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
and the co2 is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we &apos;ve found in the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
we &apos;re looking at is able to collect the two no , really , really convenient that they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we may be able to increase , &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have replace the oil industry 化工 little target . so -- so if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there are probably ? become a major energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tools to make this real-time 几组 vaccine . 
you &apos;re seeing in this case , we tend to slow down on a year and lack of money in situations they really useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine for change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species 古物 bacteria , and it &apos;s nuclear biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this ted 09年 u short of the presentation , brian cox shares some super which 对撞机 news . the content , including are doing the repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to update reality machine is running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state , every second 6亿次 and make the state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical . 
we use these detectors for mini some camera big bang . 
this is what i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this one . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters of particles around like the way the lhc . we &apos;re planning to the lhc . and , in part of a lot of particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people go to google , saw that graph is front page . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of the impact on top of it as a shock . 
but about a week later , our machines out of a major does with these 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they machine on . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do , because when it &apos;s very low them into the superconducting 导线 . 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between the temperature of the cases of these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 have put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises that it is a little bit of transmission 安培 suddenly they and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , get data and continue our mission to find out of the most basic units . 
now obviously , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but that &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still have my after the fact is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event , however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and whether i , where people think that &apos;s my life and the result is whether i , now , where people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , play 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very to come up to me and said , &quot; you don &apos;t “ ? no . you &apos;re afraid that my life is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to human consolation ! 
i was around in the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you &apos;re afraid of going to continue to collapse hit you ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of dying of despair , in a failed 苦痛 i was always get that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know not to . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , talking about fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? but , talking about fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people afraid of doing their own destiny work ? it logical ? 
nobody says “ john , do chemistry in bottleneck ? how ? ” . 
never would ask this happened .

i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
all of you think this sentiment ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even further away from a look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断

this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes down to this idea has a century 可憎 , and awful , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative genius , they continue to be alive . 
and i , myself , believed that i would certainly in the dark 绝境 and i , myself , believed that i would certainly in the dark 绝境 , especially in my career at stage , especially in my career so far . 
you see , i was young , i have to 40 years old , you know , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for life . 
and frankly , we look at all about that long , i would say is between the heart and friends , it is very likely , and i &apos;ve ever had the biggest successes . 
oh my god , what is this idea . 
is this idea , makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , is this idea , makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , i don &apos;t want to be .

i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
after a deep thinking in my opinion , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance away from the writing , and i work for extreme anxiety open outcry from writing itself , and i work for responses extreme anxious . 
this one for the last brought me into the ancient greek and ancient rome 
so please patient hear me , because to end sent back to our problems . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred djinn tense from remote places , and you know , artist came around with a remote and you know it , and you know from remote place to be an artist , around with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creativity djinn tense for “ 守护神 ” 
and for people to think socrates have such a 守护神 from a distance , what he was popular and intelligent people thought socrates have such a 守护神 , he &apos;s from a distance . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius called djinn “ ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius “ ” called djinn 
this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking at this safe distance and that &apos;s what makes people from work on 成败 psychological protection . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great . it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of genius “ ” help work done . 
if you work really , it &apos;s also not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you genius “ ” very bad . 
this is in the last westerners for a long time thinking about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , which is too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , a human cognitive themselves , and for people to make an incredibly expanding expected it completely straight up twisted , a human cognitive themselves , and for people to make an incredibly expect . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of kill artist and i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think is this so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to the older , and they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the older , and they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off 抹杀 developed 500多年 better human minds we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off 抹杀 developed 500多年 rational human mind . 
maybe i could not convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , and no one had ever tried to make us believe that there are things that you had this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath , and really towards her . 
she could feel it , because it &apos;s a piece of energy to her 撼动 feet into the ground .

and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper they just &apos;s upside down , from the last word go by , and go , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s unbelievable , and i , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad .

“ if you want this book better , and turn them into you , do you work ” part . 
“ if you &apos;re not going to help , that you see the ” to hell . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because this is my job . &quot; 
i hope that history today : i 尽责 to 坚守 my jobs € today , i hope that the historical record : i 坚守 尽责 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they are a great professional dancer who show a wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , although very unlikely , but actually happen at a dancer going beyond present 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you have in a moment , have seen that . 
it seems to stop , dancers was across the time seemed to stop , across the dancer like he did . and before the 1000场 acting is nothing but different all amazingly it all together . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was the sacred shine . 
now , people know exactly what it is , they can call out of its name was , people know exactly what it is , they can make it out . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some incredible for the magic , people will 喝彩 : arturo “ la , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 , really -- oh , wonderful , wonderful , amazing ” that is good , there emerge . 
this is a good way , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on that tuesday morning was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there emerge of god . 
and that &apos;s only when bad leg , and you &apos;re going to people , and maybe he couldn &apos;t get that last night altitude . 
maybe no longer there will be in his when gods 喝彩 dancing with his good , there should be , how are they ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of one of our self . 
this is a very hard question , which is the creative process . one of our self , it &apos;s a very hard question , which is the creative process of one of our self . 
but maybe , we were all suffering that if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this point , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dance . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dance . 
if not , that would keep dancing , your 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , that would keep dancing , your 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach the idea . 
thank you . 
thank you .

in 2009 , al gore on ted global shows the new situation , climate trend that &apos;s worth more than scientists , and he worried that for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore recently trend for the climate . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last thing in the area of the equivalent of the american south 48 state combined area 缩减 40 percent . 
but they can &apos;t completely illustrate that question . because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
it feels like the polar ice cap -- just like a good global climate system beating heart 
the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is a permanent ice 冻 
you see , it &apos;s moving into the dark blue is every winter form of the year in the summer ice permanent ice 冻 . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or more years into the ice , you know , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that allow the arctic ocean warming around the 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being an 冻 carbon and -- 干冰 解冻 , methane , carbon compost microbes . 
if you break a roof , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
in alaska lake has some light in the water , you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 went to a shallow lake . 
wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
one reason , the boreal deposition a heat heating greenland . 
this is one of the last year . 
but it is going to be larger than 往年 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of melting ice on how to make sea level rise here is its 入海口 
here are 急速 traffic . 
the earth , the other side of the planet is the largest ice . 
last month , the entire continent report scientists are in decline of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
from 40 percent of the global financial gain drinking water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
global dry that are causing fires in numbers . 
and the world &apos;s population are disasters in absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years time period , 总数 reached earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we increase day 七千万吨 co2 emissions from the ocean 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west indian times in the ocean 两边 含氧量 frequency . 
the greenhouse effect of the big reasons , except forest destruction is 20 percent of the burning fossil fuels . 
oil , coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions of countries , and china . 
the solution is to build a use more carbon -- coal planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s some have recently discovered the and some new green alternative . 
but now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political war . 
and carbon -- coal and oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
before and after christmas , my home in tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
you can see on the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest put through water . 
this is a before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of carbon -- coal industries . 
coal is cool , and i &apos;m the embodiment of happiness . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive , and he helped us economic development . 
cool coal , in every day to become more clean 
he cute , sanctuary for workers bring jobs . 
this is west virginia , a lot of coal waste 产地 . 
the biggest is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and one of the president now launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal explaining the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , are not coal 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , why don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plants . 
some 喧哗 spectacular machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
america is in economic crisis , national security , climate crisis 
these are all the strings together for us is based on carbon oil products are like on foreign oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve the problem of projects . 
repower america with 100 percent renewable electricity with a time . 
the ability to get people to work that we live more safe , and it &apos;s not in warming . 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the last one . 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
here &apos;s the future , wind and solar energy , a new network . 
new investment to create a huge job . 
repower america &apos;s wishes come true . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember that in the age of being a kid you played kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re learning how to think about and problem solving . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that very 空间结构 helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , therefore the infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable is a computer , as you interact with a little big cookie . 
siftables can bring in your hand moves , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can have with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information tools of operation . 
this individual tools with more and more sensitive to each other , with all its senses , mobile , so we can use this tool try something new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , so it &apos;s indicated in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe that image in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a 挨 a out ok , interesting thing will happen . 
and if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves each other and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that down to from a different color siftable into a siftable . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel with paint patterns of siftables , we can put these barrel into color in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it was , how can we go back a few . 
siftables and machine learning function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions learning to become 快捷 , faster that result . 
this is i &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- so -- so this is a simple equation i use a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
this word playing games together as a way down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter 几块 siftables together to make words , it will siftables in lexicon automatically find words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell it turns out that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so -- thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because in the test of siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that playing games together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them about . 
just to tell them , and this is a word puzzle ” “ together , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen on other people experience siftables . 
the lower right-hand corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just wanted to of siftables together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now i have on the screen a function of trying to interact with it . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
in this picture of child name felix . 
he could use some new add elements to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animated graphics vote image , you can bring these new to add elements on it . 
see , he took the sun add up . 
the sun it up . 
david and he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
and to shake siftables animation images that can bring new add elements to image on his new element to add up -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he &apos;s planning to story unfolding plot . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables function that into sound domain , can make like 超载 tone and bess and drum voice . 
and there &apos;s 四档 tiles for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into the siftable by the way you like . 
to put sound just come close to sound editors module . 
there &apos;s this 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles come close to sound can adjust the sound . 
so , we can use to control master rhythm and volume siftable module near the end of the modules siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the two tiles 超载 into edit , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter near drums tiles modules , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to accelerate rhythm some just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now let &apos;s put a voice to the tiles shellfish tiles sound filter . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so we don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s playing , over time , but can play a short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so -- thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want you to interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
