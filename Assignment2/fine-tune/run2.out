and this is a rapture national geographic explorers of stories , by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , the culture is an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are born in 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 life that we create 苦楚 art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture song rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 . 
if you &apos;re thinking about what would you send a different way to get to see you . 
the world of cultural 犹如 五彩缤纷 by a mental life and culture in the life conflicts and covered the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important as what we call the internet as the biosphere . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity -- it &apos;s a very powerful as our ability to look at the species . 
as far as the biosphere by the community was facing in the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet , that &apos;s 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is shining human spirit . 
it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the world in the dictionary 承 . 
every language is a kind of an ecosystem that spirit and a long time and 沉淀 . 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and our audience here in the same number of half of language is not to teach children . 
it has no language 传人 unless it works in that they will completely . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . you can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our children are not allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks , it would have a 年长者 仙逝 with the old with a language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore the race and to give you a rough race and to understand and you personally feel are die civilization . 
it &apos;s a lot of people have said i forgot the survival of “ different way , as i said earlier ” “ ” different ways . 
for example , the children of life in the northwest 亚玛逊 played methuselah -- that they &apos;re called 蚺 in the race because they believe in a time where they came from the 米尔克 东岸 used for the sacred . 
you can &apos;t distinguish between the groups in green and blue because they are the forest floor , so they 栖身 天穹 in the forest canopy , and it doesn &apos;t . 
they said in a strange kind of language and follow some rules that 通婚 异族 called went to the people who 通婚 to marry a different languages . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i &apos;ve been exposed to many people in ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had to peace . 
five years to missionary 1957 to these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they go from eight to leave the 十张 photographs in them . we think that &apos;s nice , but they don &apos;t think that these people who live in 雨林中 two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up the forest from these pictures and images , trying to get over to find these people , but what they found that person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to devil cards , so they use it with spears 戮 missionary five died . 
and it &apos;s not only 华拉尼 戮 at people . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of the population is 戮 themselves to death . 
we have to survey found only 一个八代 宗谱 natural death 两例 刨根问底 they finally , we have the same people 年迈 wood is going to do more , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , and they have this amazing bush 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell 40 a predator animals smell urine several hundred yards away and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religious voodoo teach what it was not a voodoo to have a dark . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some of the world will give you an example of religion . 
christianity , islam and buddhism other religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between . 
in the living soul . 
the dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 to just replace the soul of the soul of life in the short time for 侍僧成 shining . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we dance to be in the temple . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
and i have to have all of life in the north of columbia 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is the tyranny of civilization in extraction they were once conquered the occupation and the coast in plain columbia 此后 them back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent that has never been in the spaniards . 
and today , and they &apos;re going to be monk 续 rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain the values is the relationship between the believers , and we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it beautiful . 
they call themselves for 兄长 弟兄 call us to say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
it doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 aboriginal people can &apos;t afford the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
and that &apos;s the mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is a really important people that relationship with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia who grew up with the idea . i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you look at it this way , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this is a picture i in august in the northwest amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental 萨满教 徒 plants and make it would have died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent of plants , which is it in the brain with five 羟 color is very close to 成份 . 
jamie tribes 亚诺马 from people will have five 羟 color is plants extract the nose , and it took crack . 
if you take a sip , you can see that the powder in these hallucinations 光怪陆离 in a very exciting . 
in reality , but you don &apos;t deformed were totally wiped out . 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be one of your body , one is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
this is matter to oral color , and there is going to change oral 氧化酶 live the rest of chemicals . 
this is interesting in there -- β 藤本植物 咔 is going to be able to control the 啉 氧化酶 and play the color is so potent 不由得 you ask . 
when we do all kinds of experiments are wrong to measure it . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes are found in the cane is all of them died in the deep jungle in that we think they &apos;re different . 
if you ask them to the plant hierarchy is how they say , i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , i don &apos;t know . 
i tell you that if they said that night in months in the circle of every kind of plants that grow in different little singing to you . &quot; 
and that &apos;s not going to get your ph.d. from harvard , but it &apos;s more than accounting 报表 fun . 
dh : now we have this question , and some of us that they had the compassion indigenous life 离群索居 丰富多彩 world forward , but as we develop these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been a huge impact on life . 
this is not technology . 
even in the workers who are still 弓箭 down the great sioux nation and the people who say goodbye to sit and 骑马 马车 life was still in the united states . 
and race 完整性 threat is not change the technological innovation , or the line , but all he was barbaric . 
we look at recent of tibet where i do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
and by the genocide in the same denounce culture , but it &apos;s extinct species destruction people lifestyle by denounce 行径 didn &apos;t even be in many places it as being part of this strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
the chinese immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other together fled to nepal . 
because his mother was 关押 富农 成份 and family . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 hidden in the dress him to bring him into his because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister , and was sent 学习班 offended . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be on the face of hair and 臂章 and to be about seven years of nations 劳教 guilty . 
the pain of tibet for people to withstand a redemption we get to see 
and we &apos;re going to have a choice is that we want to live in a world of needed a 五彩缤纷 diversity , the world . 
we have to think about the 10,000 year in the world . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
the age of 新石器 for human into the seed for our agricultural age without the girl 腊 for 祭 萨满 poetry is the mantra for us to create a level of 社会分工 . it &apos;s 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society will only 三百年 history . 
and i think this brief history and enough that we have the ability to solve the challenges facing . 
when we tell the world of life for different cultures , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully species that we have to realize that all 昌盛 race , and all of those organisms to life . 
in this picture was taken in the northern 巴芬岛 when i and some people to inuit were called whales narwhals 奥拉雅 to the people i talk about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the 1950s , the government is not always practice inuit people to build our national sovereignty . we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old to move . 
his family that he put his safe , weapons , and it all away . 
you know , inuit people fear them , my god . this is the thick alone . 
they had a ski sled in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he &apos;s slept in his wear out . he took skin to pull stool 长裤 hand when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this to make a shit 口水 on the blades , and then it becomes very frozen solid , he used it to 宰杀 刀子 dog . 
the dog 剥 挽具 , and he made a dog made out of his dog sleds condoms in the middle there when you don &apos;t put it in a shit ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways . it &apos;s inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 area than the government to a texas and california &apos;s 之和 area of land returned back to the inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do something with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and i think for ever in the world of some remote places , it wasn &apos;t there . 
because there &apos;s a 族类 home . 
they are the branches of human imagination go back to the millions of people all the time for us , these kids dream with our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through and national geographic , which is , what do we do not believe politicians . 
dh : that we don &apos;t try to convince people think about it , but we can get to the world , so we can change the world &apos;s at the institutions of our website , as a click of thousands of three to five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we see , using digital images from the picture , pick out the static photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and can navigate it . 
blaise agueray photosynth arcas . 
we see here is -- so many many gb byte 千兆 level of digital photographs , and they can do for , you can zoom in on smooth and mapping by the way , they have to go to rearrange them . 
no matter how many have seen images of data , and how much of the images , how much it all with seadragon processing capability . 
so most of you are pictures taken by digital camera , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it doesn &apos;t look at what the limit system , because it &apos;s the only thing that you use a screen . 素数 seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is what he called &quot; 荒凉 dickens 山庄 line , &quot; what is the chapter . 
i &apos;ll show you that this is a picture of text and really , we can do that , you can see that it &apos;s not a text , images . 
and this is an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture of 张大 opening . 
and in the journal paper version or contains the percentage of the images , in reading , when people get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we did a little change in the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture advertising than this -- you see a normal commercial higher resolution , the picture of the extra embedded in it . 
if you want to see that the car , you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
this way , in a way to actually use a screen is limited . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and this information . 
obviously , technology applications for this map is obvious , number one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field of our contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get to the road map . 
now , let &apos;s see , down the other . 
in fact , this technology in online , you have to experience it . 
it &apos;s called the project , or photosynth , actually , two different technology . 
and the other one is seadragon , who was at the university of washington graduate noah snavely what to do with computer vision . this research and get seitz steve washington university . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . it &apos;s a beautiful cooperative results . 
in this project we &apos;ve got on the internet , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to multiple ways to look at the image , and to do with subtlety 剖析 and have a lot of the resolution to experience . 
these images , but the one in three dimensions is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
this is a lot of sense of space and strong . 
because when we make the site , to take care of the law . 
these are all from flickr photos , is that it was 串联 in space . 
and then we can then go to do so easily . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
this is really quite amazing , welcome to . 
i think you can see these images from the camera , a lot of different from a single cell phone camera , so that the quality of different pictures , in this environment was all put together . 
let me get some kind of weird . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
i remember this should have a series of photos -- well , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to rebuild , to see in the environment . 
here &apos;s the point is , effectively , we can use the community . we can start to get everybody . everybody to collect different environmental memories together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , is a much more than just to collect it all . 
this model is a crime , the whole planet . 
this is stephen lawler , like the virtual earth , &quot; the long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user 注 picture , you get the tag . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand you correctly , this software to be able to in the next few years from the picture 接合 together ? 
this software is really , really , is to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this process is entirely 接合 images based on the content . 
the more exciting is a picture of text semantic contains information . 
for example , you have to picture on the internet , the button , and on the web to have a lot of text that information with this picture . 
now , if you &apos;re all these pictures and images being , that would be like ? 
and so these semantic information , and within a link to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise congratulate , so incredible ! you . 
thank you very much . 
施瓦茨 : choice in the time . 
i want to talk about in this part of the book , i hope it and what you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i thought , well , the standard from a talk about it . 
well , what the standard ? 
the western industrial society is not a 疑 笃信 as well . 
well , this is that , if we want to make people get big benefits , on the way that is to maximize to individual liberty . 
why is this thing with the freedom is good , valuable , for people to do . 
and once you have the freedom , our own 做主 everyone can do with all the big enough to get people to benefits , they don &apos;t have 做主 for me . 
and the freedom to be a big enough to do is the selective increase . 
people have more freedom , freedom is more and more , which benefits to get more . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that age-old that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives of . 
let me give you some examples . look at the social progress , we become possible to do something . 
this is my neighborhood . not a big supermarket . 
i just want to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , it &apos;s like the supermarkets . 
and one of you turn it into a store to a 3d sound system -- voice box , because , for a cd , radio , an amplifier 磁带机 . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
the components in the store and you can have a different combination of 3d 650万种 sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
communication is , in a business . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer to that phone service , to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to die at the bad . 
those are the 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless species , especially the mobile phone . now , that cartoons . 
these are the mobile phone . 
and i was in the middle of the 津津乐道 -- that will play with mp three and a cut hair , a french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store , if seen with no , don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll see how long . 
this is the result is that people went to the store and said , &quot; are you don &apos;t have a lot more with it ? &quot; 
you want , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
answer is no “ ” . 
now you may not have to do not buy a cell phone so many things . 
again , in some other lives more than shopping to affect the things we pick up , this is the same . 
health care -- in the united states , now that you are not the doctor , to tell you how to do so again , the time . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use cure nail 乙 , and you can use it . 
and so forth . nail has happened with risk . 
and so forth . there &apos;s a very 乙 and treat . you want to do ? 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
doctors said these are very nail , again , risk , and there are very 乙 and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
doctor : you can ask “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you take that ” ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now , the ad , over the prescription drugs that are these people with you and me . if you think about it , don &apos;t say , if we can &apos;t think a 柜台 directly to buy . 
why are we doing to their marketing campaign ? 
to answer is , we looked at their ads would go to the morning after the doctor to call your doctor , to do a prescription drugs on them . 
now as our gender as this kind of thing became a subject to this slide . it &apos;s like trying to make it . 
now we are not gender inherited from my parents down there , but invented by myself . 
so we can get back to what have you shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you today , you &apos;re going to do a kind of men and women -- and make decisions . 
and in the family of marriage , everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is of course , and that &apos;s 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need to get married , and who is not what you see , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and now , you can have everything to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
i taught students a bunch of smart , but now i give them all placed homework fifth time less than one . 
it &apos;s not because they students than ever before -- so stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not and who . 
they &apos;re the brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask : what i &apos;m not married to marry ? is it going to now ? 
and when i was trying to do that ? first child , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
this is a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still not to do my homework , in all placed in my class , and they take a what grades . 
they actually have to think about this problem , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in any one time , in any one of the work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant where you can actually have a wifi , but i don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i wanted to use . 
anyway , the incredible work that we have the freedom to us is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for ourselves to break the work was so moved . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 when the mobile phone , and with another 裤兜 and put it in their blackberry blackberry . it &apos;s lap , with a laptop . 
even though they &apos;re off , we are looking at the same rivals for kids in 场上 constantly ask myself , i don &apos;t pick the phone ? 
back to the email or not ? i don &apos;t have to write this was 信稿 ? 
if you give yourself is not the answer to your children , this was the experience of the game was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whatever . it &apos;s a piece of cake , things are way of life , life is choice . 
we live in the world is like this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not all 事事 to choice . 
and we live in the world today is this . 
the question is , what is good news or bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know it &apos;s good . so let me say this is a bad . 
all these choices for people , there are two . two and a negative impact . 
one , it &apos;s a paradox , which is , we have to choose . it &apos;s not up and down , but paralyzed . 
with so many people have found a very difficult to make decisions . 
let me give you just a very vivid examples of this , this is about a project to invest in his retirement income for doing this . 
one of my colleagues had access to record . vanguard vanguard in a big company , with a foundation of about two million people , and they 000多个 place . 
that &apos;s when she was the clients and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , you give people more than 10 percent , down 5种 fund . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to choose to that is that it &apos;s not even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s , preferably tomorrow &apos;s , of course , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s never come tomorrow . 
this is not to wait for a year , they make more about the 5千元 对等 手边 溜掉 employers from an employer . it was very dedicated to things . 
so , it &apos;s too many choices are paralyzed rigid . 
it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make the right , right ? 
where you don &apos;t want to be wrong , or a foundation , which is salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices to ridiculous , something to feel regret . it &apos;s not one , is always decided to make yourself happy . 
secondly , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today , dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a choice to think , is very easy to imagine that you go to a fascinating aspect . it allows you to always think that you see the 美中不足 . 
so let me give you an example -- that comics , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is something you &apos;d right now . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
and the expensive . 
all of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
it can be better than that ? it &apos;s like this are really bad , huh , “ ” “ ” now is , in august . 
manhattan “ neighbors are not ” at home . 
i &apos;m going to be “ back to the car park in front of my own ” . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , 念叨 lost in every day of the parking , into the better chance . 
always ” “ opportunity cost has enabled us to make a decision to actually not even with a 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in that it &apos;s more , and all these things in the opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for . 
it also say “ ” now live in a sense , maybe there &apos;s this thing to do step one . 
but , of a truth is , if you had to do something , and that you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing is to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
in this time i have to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
that &apos;s the jeans , a pattern , you get back , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you have to put it in a long time , with enough times , and then get 凑合 pants . 
this is , in many years old , i finally 上街 pants to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , and they are 宽松 ? 
in front of it is to pull 扣子 locked ? 石磨 , or wash ? 
just a quick to them ? 
it &apos;s a mouth , and he asked to 喋喋不休 ? with . 
i &apos;ve got off . and i was a 缓 to god , i said , i &apos;m going to “ that was the only ” kind of pattern . 
and he fog water , and i took a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it is worse . 
why ? why this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse , the reason is because there &apos;s so much , we can choose for my jeans what should have a good to be a good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is a so much , i didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one is the best 极致 perfect . 
and that &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i had to take me and i want to do better than i expected , and it , and i became a disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for people to do what to expect a lot of good and no other people how to do that . 
just bring it to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
there &apos;s nobody to market to understand this , because if they have it , you know , people don &apos;t have to know what is this idea . i mean it . 
and it &apos;s like this : by making everything in the very worst of all better than today . 
and one of the things that are not so good experience , to some people might surprise . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every one of the only thing that you don &apos;t want it worse than you would expect . 
what you will never be surprised , because what you expect me than day and high . 
what is the secret to happiness , which is here today , you want to know , is this : the secret to happiness , don &apos;t have high expectations 知足常乐 . 
so thank you . i want to talk about ourselves a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of on the jeans , you have to buy a back , you don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , who &apos;s responsibility for what ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and the hundreds of jeans out there , you don &apos;t make excuses that might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions that would be even when it &apos;s good for them . it &apos;s so disappointed , decided to blame myself . 
in our generation of the industrialized world , in the developed world . and if any , explosive growth . 
the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
and it has to be recognized the -- well , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got to ‘ far beyond what we need to the rich ’ key value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that more choices , so that &apos;s a rich matter . 
we have a lot of the world where , at least , we heard a few of them , there &apos;s no problem , too much . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about is that modern western societies on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 said yesterday , amazing 气愤 question is , we produce the expensive and to operate the car seats , 于事无补 money is wasted . 
and i &apos;m going to say that it &apos;s expensive and complicated . it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us harm . 
they actually makes us from than before . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and fix it . 
redistribution products to all of that , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of the problems we as a plague of extra . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ understand this fish , huh ? 
tell you , in everything on this fish is ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , read it . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish , you know what . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the was paralyzed , less is satisfied . 
everyone needs this ” “ fish . 
and in this fish -- you know , for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but there &apos;s a symbolic fish , which means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
and before i talk about this project is part of the human genome , and they found a new sense of the genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to figure out the code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” a biologist , i think it &apos;s constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome from biology , and it was in the world , entered the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to ask if we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can genes from 500组 一百组 separate out in front of us that these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study the synthetic chromosomes is that we can change it to continue to questions of the fundamental problem . 
so we started to go along the way we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make that we have a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way down , just live without some sort of chemicals . 
our digital life constantly going up exponentially . . 
we can write the code , much slower progress , but it was in our recent . it &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
and it actually , for the first stage in front of us do this , let &apos;s have a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it &apos;s synthetic dna is very difficult . 
in the world &apos;s 十几万台 device made small pieces of dna , in 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , make a long time , the more and more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to release this little piece together , and it all wrong . 
this is our first from phi x 174 , to try and bacteriophage -- the first digital information . 
it &apos;s a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and get it wrong , 5,000 a symbol of dna . 
the second phase is exciting when we put this video we don &apos;t have to be put into the chemicals that started reading the genetic code , bacteria , make the virus particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles and back to kill the e. coli and 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some of the oil industry , and i think they communicate this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so what we think this is actually a software to build in biological systems in our own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer . that digital information to use those numbers have very accurate information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , gene sequencing is right for every 10,000 is basically a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , the sequence is 30 wrong . and if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design work is part of the piece of design 50 character and the other 50 character 叠加 to build a piece of times smaller units . we need to design that they can together . 
we have a design of the unique part . 
you may have heard of in our 水印 in . 
think about gene code . there are four : a , c , g and t . 
the character of the body -- and these scripts 三联 编成 about 20 amino acids amino acids , and this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the first , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and they can use to 裁 enzyme . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , which 7000 character from time to put them together make 24 , length of time and ask people to combine 几组 at a time , people long time . 
in each stage , we produce a lot of the time , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very , very reliable . you &apos;re looking for a minute . 
we try to automate level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 people basically , when they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for a long , and try to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair the dna , and it takes time to put together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation that is able to withstand 三百万度 球菌 amount of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosome . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will be back together again before their original form . 
we have 千种 can have this . 
these are completely out of water . they can be in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images , by the process , which is the yeast mentioned , and the way we design and put it in the right pieces . yeast aggregates them automatically . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just a optics microscope . 
so this is a big molecule optics microscope , we can take a look at it . 
this is about a 六秒 when images . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is a symbol than the genetic code 580000 . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
and if we don &apos;t find 10号 distance , it will print out . it to the genetic code 142页 to print . 
so how do we get a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously a very simple process with a virus that &apos;s more complicated . 
as we deal with our biology , and this is a relatively simple , you can take a tucked into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , and they came to the cells 连成 recently , but we also know we can do a whole transplant cells from the chromosome from one another and to activate cells in it . 
in the new cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we try to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve had a second of all species or from other parts of the third side , in a second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
by what they were in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called by enzymes are able to dna . 
the cells to think that there &apos;s this enzyme when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it was out and work out of the chromosome is no matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a has a new dna . 
we put it into a gene causing blue . 
in very short period of time , all the characteristics of all species to disappear , and it into a new species , we put the cells on the new software “ ” . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is that we actually put into it . 
this might sound like 炼金术 genes , but we can do with dna , to move to radically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
i think , for some reason we do need is very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to each of us from 1946 , who is in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this creature . it can replace or any of the program , which is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that all of this material was in the atmosphere of co2 emissions . 
now we have found from around the world has about a gene 两千万组 database , and i just love them as the design components . 
there &apos;s only the electric industry , and look for a components that can get diversity . 
now the limits of reality from biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because this is what we can make a group of “ ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day , the chromosomes . 
and this is just a standard . we can choose to choose to survive , or chemical production , the production and fuel . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit on computers working with the design of the species to software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what it looks like the genetic code . 
now to put our attention on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad experiment . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it &apos;s sugar into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
and the carbon dioxide -- which is one . 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it was almost boiling the water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen methane , carbon dioxide molecules into the its energy source . 
if we look at the two to collect their things really , really , they can be introduced to stand , fuel , to drive into this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase in life ? &quot; &quot; what is the understanding of basic questions . 
we really have with the oil industry 化工 . and little goals . now , if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we &apos;re using the tools to make this real-time 几组 vaccine . 
you see this year &apos;s flu , we tend to slow down on a lack of time and money in the case that when the vaccine useful . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is what the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species of bacteria , which is really the 古物 and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a far more human life to improve the way , our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this short ted 09年 speak of the u , brian cox : 对撞机 shares some which are the news . now , what do the maintenance and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said it back to show you what it is the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
in the universe reinventing billionth of a second state per second , and it made a 6亿次 state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in the ground 日内瓦 
we have these little to some camera that big bang . 
and this is the period , a detector atlas 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last september 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters of particles around the lhc . the way we &apos;re planning , as part of the lhc . and , in a lot of particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know is that it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 to google -- when people see this graph is front page . 
this is that we work with this as a culture of it as a shock . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the golden 导线 导线 -- these . 
and when they transmission 导线 安培 on this machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers , those wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do it , because when it &apos;s a very low 导线 superconducting . 
so in less than 271摄氏度 below the surface of the universe is so strong that can 导线 transmission of electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in one of the 接点 put a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of transmission and they and their resistance 安培 
it is . 
that was pretty shocking , because they weigh up to hear about 20 tons a ruler and move . 
there are about 50 magnet . 
they have to have to work on these 卸 has done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now wait for them back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 refer to be the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , on our data and get out of the most fundamental of the universe . 
now obviously , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still want my with the fact is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you . 
elizabeth gilbert , creativity and reduce 呵护 about creativity . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change . 
however , recently , in my life working in a particular event happened , however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , to a particular event , and i have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
now , the result is whether people , where i think this is the result is that this life , and no matter where people , i think that this is my life . 
so , really , really , not to save , play 完了 . 
they have to worry about it , and i said , &quot; you don &apos;t “ ? no . you &apos;re afraid of this in my life is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s really is . &quot; 
i was around with the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you not afraid to take you on the collapse hit ? 
you end up in the dream is full of despair , died in 苦痛 failure , and i was always get that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this is a scary , until today . 
yes , this is a scary , until today . 
well , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know that . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , speaking of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? but , speaking of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? 
this is a better idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in my destiny logical ? it work ? 
no one said , &quot; john , chemistry “ work with a bottleneck ” ? how ? 
never would ask this happened . 
of course , it &apos;s a chemistry 平心而论 engineers , not just in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of the century , a great case 英年早逝 creative genius , they just look at the early years of the century , a great example of creative genius , they are often 英年早逝 lightly died from age . 
if the suicide , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent , not even if the suicide , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent . 
the 曼梅 le , before he died in the last one interview i said , in every book “ all 蚕食 ” part of me . 
in your work life , this is how you radical . 
i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
you have no idea that this problem ? even further away from a look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even further away from a look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 
this is not only 可憎 , terrible , and i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this is not only 可憎 , terrible , and i don &apos;t want that goes to the idea of this century , and that &apos;s not only 可憎 , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think great creative genius , we encourage them to be alive . 
and i , myself , believed that i would certainly in the dark , and my 绝境 believed that , i will inevitably 绝境 in the dark , especially in my career at stage , especially in my career so far . 
you see , i was young , i have to 40 years old , you know , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years with life . 
and frankly , we have to look at that long , i would say is , in my heart , and it is possible , and i &apos;ve ever been the most successful . 
oh my god , it &apos;s kind of ideas . 
is this idea , and you &apos;re on a piano 大清早 drank way not to drink , is this idea , and you &apos;re on a piano 大清早 drank way not to drink , i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
and i think , in a deep , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
in some way , i have to build a safe distance themselves from the writing , and i work for the response of extreme concern , and i started writing about the extreme anxiety response . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please bear with me , because we end up to around . 
in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human . 
people believe , is to create a sacred away from the djinn , and you know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know , and away from the goal is to know where the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks called in common with this kind of creativity , to the djinn “ 守护神 ” 
and for people to think that there &apos;s a socrates 守护神 from a distance , wisdom and gives him for people to think that there &apos;s a socrates 守护神 , he &apos;s from a distance . 
the idea of rome , they have similar to this kind of creative genius “ ” djinn called ancient rome with people like that , they put this kind of creative genius “ ” djinn called 
this is wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think it &apos;s a genius “ ” 聪慧 personal this idea of a wonderful , because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a genius “ ” 聪慧 personal . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i find this safe distance in that &apos;s what makes people from work on 成败 psychological protection . 
we can understand that business model , right ? 
and the artist by this idea , to get protection of the ancient narcissism by an artist , and get this idea to protect narcissism too . 
if you work great , that you can &apos;t completely because in fact , you know you &apos;re in a kind of genius “ ” work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you really bad ” “ genius . 
this is in the western for a long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked to swallow 无异 in the sun , and the vulnerable individual , which is too big . 
this is a completely distorted cognitive self , and people for people to build something that was completely expect people to bend a cognitive self , and that was done for people expect . 
i think that &apos;s the pressure , in the last 500 years of artists kill , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of the artist . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think that &apos;s what we now the question is : how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 500多年 developed out of the reason we don &apos;t mind with a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 500多年 developed out of the reason . 
well , maybe i could not convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? i mean , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any of us had tried to make sure you &apos;ve all had to sit on the side of the creative process . it doesn &apos;t always know better . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 really breath , and the next to her . 
she could feel it , because it comes to power is she 撼动 feet into the ground . 
she could feel it , because it comes to power is she 撼动 feet into the ground . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with only one thing , and she said , is to 死命 “ 狂奔 ” 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : sometimes she said she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she &apos;s on the other hand , a poem tail to pull it 顺势 , back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 顺势 on paper , and put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper . 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 on paper , what &apos;s upside down , they just from the beginning , by the word , go back to the first time . 
i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and i , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 , and i would like to get the idea of an accident , but even 古板 , and i would like to get an accident . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people like this . 
if you think , 墨守成规 people like me , i will meet and to the idea of where you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to , and i don &apos;t know where inspiration . 
this is exactly what happened ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it &apos;s not going to , not rational ? we &apos;re going to see how it will loss , don &apos;t mind ? 
he was going to capture it , but there &apos;s no way , he &apos;s not a paper tape , no , he was trying to capture it , but there &apos;s no way , he didn &apos;t tape , a piece of paper . 
i don &apos;t “ , i can &apos;t do ” 
suddenly , he had to go to a weird panic and impatience emotions , and do something unusual .

he &apos;s looking up at the sky , and it said , you can &apos;t see “ sorry , i was driving ? he ” look up at the sky , and it said , you can &apos;t see “ sorry , i was driving ” ? 
he &apos;s looking up at the sky , and it said , you can &apos;t see “ sorry , i was driving ? ” seem like i could immediately the piece that look like ? 
if you really want to pick out in the world , and a great time to come in , i could , if you really want to pick out in the world , and a good time , i come back in time . 
today , or you can go to each other , to bug , 莱昂纳德 科恩 . 
today , or you can go to each other , to bug , 莱昂纳德 科恩 . 
since that event , tom &apos;s after the creative process . 
it doesn &apos;t work , and we &apos;re still onto something is still the dark . 
he can be created by the unknown , and it &apos;s a weird , wonderful and in between the strange relationship with this can be inspired by the unknown , and he &apos;s a weird , wonderful in between , and that &apos;s a relationship there outside . 
this story 潜移默化 my work to change the way , this transformation has saved me this story again 潜移默化 my work to change the way , this transformation has saved me again . 
not only is it , and it &apos;s completely shit , i think i should go to write this book . 
not only is it , and it &apos;s completely shit , i think i should go to write this book . 
and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 things , and i tried to try and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 things , and i tried to . 
and i lift the manuscript , to an empty room of the manuscript from my head to lift , one of the room . 
“ because you can see , i have no committed to maintain order of a ” “ because you can see , i have no committed to maintain order of ” . 
“ if you want this book , better to you now turn that part of them , do you ” work . 
if you &apos;re not “ to help , that you see the ” to . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because it &apos;s my job . &quot; 
i hope that history today : i 尽责 坚守 jobs , i hope i € history today : i 尽责 坚守 prove to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they are a professional dancer . 
occasionally , it &apos;s unlikely , but actually happens when a dancer going beyond present 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
time to stop the dancer , like the time , it seems like a dancer , the movement and what he did before 1000场 performance , and no difference , but all of these amazingly it up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , light from the inside of his life , from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was sacred shine . 
now , people know exactly what it is , they can call it the name of the time , people know exactly what it is , they can make it out . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing , for the magic of people will 喝彩 : “ 欧 -- oh , oh , 嘞 欧 嘞 , la , really great , wonderful , amazing ” that is good , there emerge . 
well , this way , because this is what we need . 
for artists , is the most intractable dancers 悠悠 morning , to turn up the artist &apos;s tricky , for the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on a tuesday morning that was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
and that &apos;s only when bad leg , you &apos;re going to the old people , and maybe he couldn &apos;t get at that last night . 
and he will not dance to people in god 喝彩 when he was going to do with good , there are ? 
this is a very smart questions , which is the process of our self . 
this is a very smart questions , which is the most painful process of our self , it &apos;s a very smart questions , which is the process of our self . 
but maybe we would have pain , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought that wonderful art completely from you . 
so if we look at this point , everything changed . 
“ 气馁 , don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t you just have to do good work ” part . 
“ 气馁 , don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t you just have to do good work ” part . 
the 坚守 jobs in your , whatever you jobs is : if you do , which is a dancer dance . 
the 坚守 jobs in your , whatever you jobs is : if you do , which is a dancer dance . 
if not , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs , and i still 欧 嘞 喝彩 : for you . 
if not , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs , and i still 欧 嘞 喝彩 : for you . 
i believe that we have to teach this one . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 . 
in 2009 , al gore here at ted global shows in the new trend climate scientists , that &apos;s worth more than that , and that for his ” “ clean coal . 
and the trends for al gore . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last thing in the area of south america &apos;s 48 state 缩减 40 percent of the area . 
but that doesn &apos;t really fully . this problem , because that &apos;s not that rare of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the heart of the climate system . 
in the summer , 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 . 
red is 冻 permanent ice . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue is a year in the winter and summer ice 冻 permanent ice . 
what “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five or more years of ice , you know , it &apos;s like to move blood 各部 &apos;s body . 
in the 25 years , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect 受热 冻土 around the arctic ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon , it would be 冻 解冻 干冰 . it &apos;s methane , carbon compost . 
now , if a greenhouse gas emissions , it &apos;s going to have the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the light in alaska in the water is you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
the last winter , university professor of alaska katey walter 结队 light to a lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
one reason , the sink , which is a heat heating . 
this is one of the last year . 
but it has to be 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq greenland . 
if you want to understand how the land make ice melts , sea levels rising 入海口 here it is . 
here are 急速 traffic . 
the earth , the other side of the planet in the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
this is the into the sea level , and greenland . 
the third largest ice in the himalayas , in the top , you can see new lakes , and it &apos;s just a few years ago , ice . 
the global financial water from 40 to 50 percent of the water . 
in the ice 安第斯 mountains , this is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
the snow in california , sierra 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you can see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
it dry in the world &apos;s population in the fire . 
and the number of disasters , and it &apos;s quite unprecedentedly absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years in time , to the earlier 七十五年 总数 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we every day to increase the co2 emissions 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
look at the ocean area from east to west in america , india 两边 含氧量 in the ocean . 
most of the greenhouse effect than 20 percent of destruction , forest is burning fossil fuels . 
coal oil most urgent matter . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
one solution was to use more carbon of the planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
there &apos;s been recently discovered some new and some of the green alternative . 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political . 
the oil and coal carbon and spent the last year to promote 两千五百万美元 . that &apos;s clean coal . 
that &apos;s what i remembered . 
christmas back and forth , my home in tennessee digging up of billions of 淤泥 coal . 
you can see on the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest put through water . 
and the before and after christmas . 
this is a carbon -- coal industries . 
coal is cool , and i &apos;m the embodiment of happiness . 
in the united states , you can see he was also fertile more productive economy to help us . 
coal cool every day in and become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , the 产地 coal . 
most of the head of the coal mining massey 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and now one of the work of two projects . 
this is one part of one of them . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of explaining the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , are not coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean smell . 
so , why don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plant . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and burning coal to global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with security and economic challenge . 
and in the u.s. national security and economic crisis , the climate crisis 
these are all the strings together is based on carbon oil for our products are like on foreign oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solution to this problem . 
in america for repower with a clean electricity . 
the new work to get people to our lives more safe , and it &apos;s not in the warming . 
and finally , a big enough to solve our problems . 
america repower know more . 
the final 
this is about repower america . 
in the old oil and dirty , and this is our planet . we have to rely on the other way . 
here &apos;s the wind and solar power , and new energy . 
in the new big create more money . 
repower . it &apos;s time to america &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables -- think for a toy . 
first , i want you to remember that when you &apos;re being a kid with a kit . 
when you design and how to build with legos and to do is , when you &apos;re thinking and learning how to solve problems . this is the object is to understand and 空间结构 perception . 
understand that help us very 空间结构 around for a lot of learning things . 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so it will have this siftables . 
siftable simply say , with a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can just hand siftables 每块 siftable can move each other , sense each other , and move 每块 siftable monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- with that digital information tools . 
with independence , more tools that are more sensitive to each other , with all its senses , mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
it &apos;s siftable 映 like this , if i put it to tilt side , so that &apos;s what it &apos;s tilted at this picture , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe that image in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables perception to each other . 
if you give them a 挨 out a good , interesting is going to happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that there &apos;s a kind of chaos . 
they can move each other and feel , maybe . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures and siftables , like a liquid that make it from a different color siftable into a siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put into the color of the water in the middle , which color , put together . 
if it more , you can go back and some . 
and the machine learning siftables function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to learn from these functions 快捷 , getting faster at it . 
and i &apos;m here to show you why siftables . so -- and this is a simple equation , i use a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
this &quot; play games together as a way that you just take off , with a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together siftables of words , it would look at the word itself in the dictionary . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word that you have to change the sequence of words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so -- thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because in the use of siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that playing games together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , &quot; this is a game ” “ together , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
this guy on the bottom right is the age of the smallest experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now that &apos;s on the screen function interact with it a try . 
we want to be siftables people learn language . 
this image of the children &apos;s felix . 
he can get some new images to add elements on it , he did it take to the table siftables towards it , put a video images can bring these new to add elements on it . 
see , he added up to the sun . 
all of the sun . 
now david tractors add up to him . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
shake it to the siftables images can turn it into a new element . he took on added up new elements -- the 吠 . 
he was writing his own story of it . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of story , his story . how do plot . 
the balloon sitting off . 
and i &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function in 编排 and play music is , we &apos;ve developed , siftables function of this in a way , to sound like the 超载 and bess , the sound of a drum . 
and there were 四档 任君 choice , but for change . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to come to sound editors module . 
there &apos;s a sound like a 响器 , which works siftable module . 
voice to those tiles that can come close to sound . 
so , we can use to control , and the rhythm and volume of the modules siftable siftable come close to the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
the 超载 to get into the two tiles , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now , in some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to put sound filter , were drums tiles that you can adjust sound . 
i &apos;m going to rhythm and pace up some just come close to the tiles . 
now let &apos;s put a block and filter come close to the shellfish voice . 
in the process and play music to 编排 . 
so you don &apos;t need to have 编排 over time , it &apos;s based on play , but it &apos;s a short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the volume , play with the tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so -- thank you . 
as you see , my vision is to develop a new medium human-computer interaction with the better the brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want you to interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and the technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
