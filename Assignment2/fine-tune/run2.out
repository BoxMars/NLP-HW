through rapture purpose photos and national geographic explorers of stories , by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these cultural is at an alarming rate disappear from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same an adaptive rules . 
we &apos;re all born into 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
to confront cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance with 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and dance has unique signature rhythm . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different perspectives will let you see hope . 
this world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture life intertwined and into the internet covered the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call biosphere ecology as important as the web . 
this is a human race circle the great heritage . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also , as we have a strong exploring ability species logo . 
as biosphere by severe erodes the same race circles also facing the same shorter and its destruction faster 
this one is the most important sign language . 
in our lives on this planet have used 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is shining human spirit . 
it &apos;s all solid mental unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a spiritual ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and our audience numbers here as much in these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no 传人 take valid solutions that unless they will completely disappeared . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re a final say 本族语 dialects who couldn &apos;t lineage ancestors wisdom also not allowed to predict the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
another spooky turns on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 with the oldest accompanied by a language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore this ethnic loop loop race to give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are die civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people already forgot that i mentioned earlier “ survival ” in front of a different way , i said “ survival ” different ways . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 bacillus pull played methuselah areas 蚺 that they &apos;re called the race because they believe that they came from a legends 米尔克 sacred river 东岸 snake allow it was born . 
this groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 jungle , so in their opinion 天穹 forest canopy with no difference . 
they say , with a weird language and follow a unique 通婚 called linguistics 异族 通婚 rules that people with one person to person married a different language . 
this is the mythology of historical lineage down , you can see a strange phenomenon because one of the same reason 异族 婚 大家族 often have 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
i once in contact with many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing race in 1958 years earlier , i used to that they had peace friendly contact . 
five year 1957 missionary trying to get them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the sky 十张 eight to 10 pictures they himself in our mind , it &apos;s friendly means , but they don &apos;t think these people who live in 雨林中 never seen two-dimensional picture . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures , and then take photographs get over to try to find these people person , but they found nothing , and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 this missionary five died . 
that &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 戮 external people die . 
and they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent death population is 戮 themselves to death . 
we &apos;re doing 宗谱 一个八代 survey found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally goes out to the truth will wood 年迈 devastation behavior when they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have astonishing for jungle 惊诧 perspectives . 
they can smell predator 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is animals urine . 
in order to understand the mysteries i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach them how thing voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s very interesting . 
if i want you to list some important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
voodoo individual beauty in it who are born with the connection between 
born makers planted soul 
in response to dance rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 below soul temporarily replace born makers soul in this brief moment 侍僧成 shining for god . 
so voodoo believers likes to say you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re cathedral / be god . 
you &apos;ve been household gods attached . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
in my community exposed to all of life in the mountains in northern columbia santa 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization descent , they were once conquered and occupied the area of the caribbean columbia coast plain 此后 them back to the caribbean coast plains of an isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent this race has never been seen conquered spaniard 
to get along with monk 续 today , they would rule institutions , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like 母腹 back into groups are taught the values that maintain these values is transforming the relationship between the believers in the universe we might call ecological balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect its beauty . 
they call themselves for 兄长 弟兄 call us to say we are destroying the world of people . 
the ability to create this intuition , very important . 
indigenous will not 多愁善感 wouldn &apos;t tolerate 思乡 of torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is the mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this symbol is important meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
in british columbia , i grew up in the jungle influenced by local people thought that i think is going to be logging in the woods . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultural created a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this picture are me this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 dead cane many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often use it to make water -- dead cane psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is its component with brain within five -- 羟 color is the 成份 very close . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribal person will start with five -- 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you use nose sucked into these powders 光怪陆离 hallucinations , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distorted , but were totally wiped out 
but these color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they would be an organ in your body called alone is 氧化酶 enzyme activity change . 
to oral these color is matter there must also oral change alone is 氧化酶 living sexual other chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that exist in 藤本植物 β -- 咔 啉 exactly can inhibit alone is 氧化酶 and play is the potency of color , so you ask yourself 不由得 
we ordinary people will do all kinds of experiments constantly measure outcomes are wrong 
but if you ask indians , they &apos;ll say plants will speak . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person found 17 species die cane is all they &apos;re in deep jungle found in our mind , they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask how they gave these plants hierarchy , they said , &quot; i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not necessarily plants have to say is not understand me . 
i tell you that if they said in the night 17 months round things that grow every plant to use the different little word singing to you . 
this discovery will not allow you to get at harvard university ph.d. , but it &apos;s far more than accounting 报表 have fun . 
dh : now we have this question , though , our compassion in some people think they 离群索居 tragedy indigenous life 丰富多彩 world forward , but as we develop these people back to the edge of status in history . 
and all cultures have been threatened by new lifestyle strongly shock 
the problem is not technology itself . 
sue mobs indians even down 弓箭 still is a great sioux nation indians and americans say goodbye 骑马 and sit 马车 life was still americans . 
ethnic circles 完整性 threat is not change or technological innovation itself , but power is barbaria lined up his activism . 
we look at the mountains tibet recently where i have done extensive research , where you &apos;ll see authoritarian political oppression brutal . 
although genocide in the world are consistent denounce genocide endangered cultures , but it &apos;s destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce in many places it even considered strategy by this part of development . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet withstand 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
chinese invasion immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 by 关押 成份 and family . 
he was still there are only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and being sent 学习班 behavior . 
one day she accidentally step into stuck with mau chairman 臂章 and be in the face of a nation to accept seven 劳教 guilty 
the pain of tibet for people to withstand human redemption mental need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need an 五彩缤纷 , diversity in the world . 
we stand up there in the world , we &apos;ve got 60 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
revolution 新石器 era for human into the agricultural age for our seed top girl 腊 erotic 萨满 poetry is the mantra for cheese 祭 after we created a level of 社会分工 into this only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to let us have the ability to solve the challenges facing millennium 
when we tell the world &apos;s cultures asking meaningful life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in a song of that , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species fully realize we have to make sure all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with optimism 
this photo was me in northern 巴芬岛 on the top , and then i made some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people tell me about tells a story of his grandfather legendary 
in the 1950s canada government is not always practice inuit people to build our sovereign states that we &apos;re going to make the 定居点 away by them . 
this old man refused to migrate grandfather . 
his family worried he safely put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know the inuit people fear the cold , which is their days alone , thick advantage . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 clad in a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he &apos;s slept outside wearing his seal leather 长裤 to put his hand stool pulling bits stool quickly become stiff when he put it into blades shapes . 
and in this shit to make the blades edge puke on frozen after 口水 wait it becomes very robust after he put 刀子 宰杀 using this dog . 
next 剥 dogs bark out again into a 挽具 his chest dog sleds condom made to another dog when to stop that put between the knife made of manure on ice sheet . 
this is really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways dh : these are inuit all indigenous people around the world of real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 canada government to an area than texas and california &apos;s largest 之和 area of land back returned to inuit people . 
i was our new home its name dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the marine resources . 
this is very good example to demonstrate a country can do something with it managed to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , i think for ever in the world of some remote areas for people actually not remote there . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent branch of human imagination dates back to the ancient origins period for all of our people for these kids dream with our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think jt debate is not to convince people , but we think , by talking about facts can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s good at talking about facts institutions our website month click amount about three to five 百万次 thousands 
we 156 channels in play a country . 
we have millions of readers magazine 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos of this stunning conducted photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from online picky . using a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of scenes , and can navigate them . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
we see here is so many many gb 千兆 byte ) level of digital photographs , and they can make sustainability and smooth mapping zoom in , you can browse them by the way , you could still for them to rearrange . 
no matter how many have seen data sets , images have much itself and image how big it all with seadragon , processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , having 3亿个 pixels . 
however , through it doesn &apos;t make any difference because limit system performance only factor is just : you &apos;re using screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of data . 
this is what he called &quot; 荒凉 dickens 山庄 line is , &quot; chapter of content . 
i &apos;ll give you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do this , you can see , this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture 张大 version opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , when people get better reading experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in this issues to &quot; the guardian &quot; corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you just saw ordinary ads , higher resolution versions of the extra embedded in pictures of content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can still see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a certain extent averted screen actual use area limits . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary played out the window and things like garbage information . 
obviously , technology applications for this map is obvious , number one of the applications . 
so , i really don &apos;t want to spend too much time to introduce , i just want to tell you that we &apos;ve created this field for your contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this technology already online , you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merge with two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other recognizes was entirely at the university of washington graduate noah snavely undertake computer visual research findings . this research also get steve seitz washington university . 
and microsoft institute rick szeliski help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got applied seadragon , it &apos;s based on technology building . 
you can see , we have access to multiple ways of looking at taking pictures and images to communicate subtlety of 剖析 and have more resolution browse experience . 
however , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there are many examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , going to take care of legal issues . 
these are all from flickr photos , by this by 串联 up in space . 
and then we actually can browse to do so easily . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would end to work for microsoft 
by this welcome pretty amazing , really happy . 
i think you can see these images from the original : from many different camera phone camera into a single professional backwards . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment is being put together . 
let me find something quite mysterious images . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 pictures , etc . 
i remember here should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to the poster in to see the rebuilding of the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can effectively online community with everyone . we can start to get everyone to different data environment memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , all the secondary out to be much more than just gather up all . 
this model can secondary out , is the whole planet . 
this is stephen lawler like &quot; virtual earth &quot; long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use and constantly becomes complicated , become more valuable . 
user picture , you &apos;ll be on 注 labels . 
thank you very much ! 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years will come from global images 接合 together ? 
this software is . that &apos;s the real meaning to explore . 
it builds up on images between hypertext . 
this process is entirely 接合 based on images of content . 
more exciting is that image contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you have to picture on the internet , the key word later , page text will contain vast with this picture relevant information . 
now , suppose you all these pictures and images being , that will ? 
then , so these semantic information , and within each link capacity is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate your ! 
thank you very much ! 
barry : choice in 施瓦茨 baffled . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about this book of content hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i think , from one recognized the creed of going up . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 疑 笃信 creed . 
well , this is to say this : if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to make personal freedom to maximize . 
the reason is the freedom that stuff with itself is good , valuable , for people are essential . 
moreover , once people had freedom , our own 做主 everybody can use all the way the big enough to get people to welfare , don &apos;t they 做主 for me . 
and the freedom to achieve great approach is the largest increase selective limits . 
people more choices , which is more freedom , freedom , getting more and more that welfare . 
i think , this concept like 掺 into our water in that deep-rooted that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives footprint . 
let me give you some examples look contemporary social progress development have let us become possible to do anything . 
this is my nearby . not a big supermarket . 
i just wanted to say here salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and then you turn out to be a one set of pop-up stores to allocation stereo system -- voice box conclusion , cd machine conclusion , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system is much count couldn &apos;t . 
using this store components that you can have a close 650万种 various combination of three-dimensional stereo system . 
you can &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a different industries , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer telephone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
normally happens , it &apos;s not going to die phone all bad . 
that already 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially mobile . yuyu shows cartoons . 
these are the future of mobile phones . 
one of my most 津津乐道 -- that is the middle will carry mp three playing machine , nose and french 焦糖 布丁 cutting hair in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen anything , don &apos;t worry , can &apos;t use a long , you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people running to the store , and you ask : is there a without so much function ? &quot; 
you want , answer would be ? 
answer is no ” “ . 
now you &apos;ve been impossible to buy a not so many things stem cell phones . 
similarly , in some other lives more than shopping for us to affect the things that same choice bang existed . 
healthcare -- in the united states , now it &apos;s not that long to see your doctor , who straightforward tells you how to do era . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , doctors would say to you : we can use treatments nail , can also use 乙 solutions . 
and so forth solution nail has happened with risk . 
and so forth treatments have 乙 solution and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , should i do ” how ? 
the psychiatrist says again , nail has these things and risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how are you going to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you pick ” that ? 
but my doctor said “ ” not you . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for these people with you and me . if you think about it , didn &apos;t say . and since we can &apos;t think a 柜台 directly to buy . 
why are we doing to their marketing campaign ? 
they want to answer is , we looked at the morning after ads would go to your doctor , let &apos;s call the doctors make prescription drugs put into them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became choice topic . like this slide to illustrate that . 
now our gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by ourselves to invent . 
so we can go back to what have you shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do a kind of men and women -- is still make a decision . 
in marriage family ways , in the past everybody got married , it &apos;s almost like age natural thing , and was soon 生儿育女 . 
you need only choice is and who got married , rather than when node , it &apos;s not married , after what to do . 
and today , about everything that can take picks 挑拣 拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart bright students , but now i gave them all placed assignment less than a fifth one before . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever before student ) stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so who . 
now the reason is their brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask yourself : i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry now node ? is it ? 
it &apos;s after the first is that ? i &apos;ll come back to a child , i &apos;ll 顾 career ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still not all placed do my homework , or whether they in my class to take a what grades . 
they really should go to these questions , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technological progress in one day we could make any time , in the earth in a corner work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but really , this restaurant in one place can wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible choice is freedom bring us our choices are to make decisions , again , again , again , now to work for themselves , or is it breaks hanging around . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 installed in the phone , another 裤兜 installed in their blackberry &#91; with &#93; blackberry , with the lap and laptops . 
even though they were locked up , we still looking at the children in 场上 rivals for and constantly ask myself , i still don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
back to this email or not ? should i shouldn &apos;t write this sealed 信稿 ? 
if you give yourself answer is no , you have children , and it was a ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether issue is still a piece of cake , material is still lifestyle terms , life is choice . 
we used to live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not everybody needs 事事 choice . 
and today we live in the world is something like this . 
the question is , what is good news or bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
one , some say up an oxymoron , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us is not liberating , but box , is paralysis . 
with so many choices that people want to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just an extraordinarily vivid example to illustrate this point , this is about a peer-to-peer pension plan investment ways to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest vanguard record . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million employees and 2 , 000多个 office place . 
she survey found is that when these customers and their employees to provide the support fund -- every single species increases 10 to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you provide 50种 foundation , employees to people than when you provide 5种 fund 10 percent decline . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s preferably tomorrow &apos;s , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not join this peer-to-peer plan every year , they make more sensing the 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated provides this subsidies . 
so , too many choices , possibilities , the results were numb rigid . 
it makes us into this world look like this slide show cartoons . 
when you enter 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make that decision is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you definitely don &apos;t want to choose wrong co-op foundation , or a salad ingredients . 
there are several reasons . 
more choices , just as easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , is always not satisfied their choices make decisions . 
secondly , is what economists call “ opportunity cost ” things . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to those other things . 
well , when people have many options consider , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you quit to attract people aspect . and that makes you always was chosen for you to think that 美中不足 . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , if i take a 歉 . 
but this is now you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
expensive rich zone . 
gorgeous beach , sunlight 明媚 , they have all this . 
you can still better than that ? it &apos;s now without thinking “ huh , really bad , ” “ ” now is , in august . 
manhattan “ neighbors are not home , ” 
i &apos;m going to be back “ can put the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he has been tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost in the parking percent better chance . 
“ opportunity cost ” always has enabled us to make a decision not happy , even the decision actually quite 英明 . 
we &apos;re facing options more attractive in these options that are more , and all these things became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means several questions . 
it also says out in the present whatsoever “ ” this principle . maybe even include things to do step step here . 
but , of a truth is , when you chose to do something , and then you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing to attract you tend to have a lot of places , and will undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time when i went to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time to wash up enough times , later , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , this is wearing pants for many years old , i finally 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
counter said , you &apos;re 紧身 type , comfort type , was 宽松 type ? 
in front of it is to pull 扣子 locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
going that fast grind breaking ? 
and the mouth , is still a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw nearly fall down . i &apos;ll ever 缓 god , let me ask , what i want is “ that was the only ” kind of pattern . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , i &apos;m wearing a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is , because there are so many can choose for a sex , my jeans what should have more good to be greatly good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a while , i didn &apos;t expect too much . 
when they have a hundred dimensions , huh , at least one is the best 极致 perfect . 
and that &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i expect compare , and i expect than this line up , i became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond didn &apos;t give people delivered many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize results less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
market out there &apos;s nobody understood this principle . because if they know there &apos;s one thing , you don &apos;t have the opportunity to know what is this idea . i mean cartoons . 
so it &apos;s like this cartoon by : in everything terrible past everything better than now . 
the reason is that when one of the things that are not so good when people have may experience to some surprises . 
now , in these rich , our civic life industrialized world , perfect . it &apos;s of course , for every one of the things you most only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
you will never be what , what surprises , because you my than god or high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , which is you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
( applause smoking a little bit of time . i want to talk about myself , i married my wife , now she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t try . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there &apos;s shop in hundreds of jeans for you choose , you bought a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now obviously the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
there &apos;s just laid on the jeans hundreds of excuses , you don &apos;t put things might mess . 
the result is , when people make decisions , even if that decision achieve results good they are still &#91; to &#93; disappointed , decided to blame myself . 
in our generation in the past , developed countries -- industrialized world now in clinical repressed disorder explosive growth . 
and finally , the net effect is the objective , although we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this &#91; choose to bring happiness -- the standard creed , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no doubt choose to better than no choice , but not just this reasoning choose more is better . 
here &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we choose the richest ‘ ’ needs the critical value . 
i &apos;ll say finished . now , here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , give us that industrial society with so many choices , is matter vastly rich . 
we in the world and places , at least , we heard a few of those problems , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern western societies on one particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we produced those expensive and very difficult to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just in waste money . 
and today i &apos;m saying is that these expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really bring us harm . 
they actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call the 帕累 thomas improve practice . 
redistribution product will allow all people , not just the poor , living good , because we did pull through those like plague of affecting our excess choice . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position and say , &quot; huh , this fish “ know what ? 
tell you , in this fish in everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increased was paralyzed , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs such a “ ” fish . 
so in this fish -- you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means suffering is going to , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective : we &apos;re doing digitized biology worked . and now we &apos;re trying to from those numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life ” “ , i think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , when it from a biological mimic analysis world entered the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , whether we could build any life , or whether we from the digital world can create a new life ? 
this is a graph sequence of microbes , mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome can make it replicate in the lab . and we &apos;re trying to understand whether we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 genes 一百组 separate out in front of us that these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue to ask these basic problem . 
so we started along this path , we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle really allowed us to make these we never succeeded , the overlarge molecules ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , by the way down , just some topless live sexual chemicals . 
our digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
we write gene code is capable of progress , very slowly , but also still increasing . we &apos;re going to put in recent speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
it actually passed several stages . when we did the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna , length in 30 to 50 character , and this is a regression process , the more fragmented made a mistake , longer producing as much more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together and righted all wrong . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 bacteriophage genome -- and start digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , after wrong righted , which has a 5,000 scripts length of dna . 
the second phase is exciting when we put this video didn &apos;t have to live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells releases virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli &#91; 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some oil industry , i think they communicate with this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this situation is actually in software can build a biological system within our own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re on a computer started using digital information . that these digital information must be very accurate . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , gene sequencing is every 10,000 right standards for a fundamental mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , when the average sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence , which set of genes could never have been launched . 
design work is partly design 50 scripts length of time and other 50 scripts long footage 叠加 to build smaller units . we &apos;re designing times before they get together . 
there we design some unique part . 
you may have heard in which we added 水印 
consider genetic code has four scripts : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 the body -- and these scripts 编成 for about 20 amino acids , like every amino acids , there &apos;s a symbol tagged 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we &apos;ve designed these fragmented and can use to cut 裁 enzyme . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , from 7000 scripts length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 scripts length of time and pull 几组 snippet merger , became 72 7,000 long fragmented . 
in each stage , we train these images from a vast and so we can give them -- because we want to create an extremely reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very large snippet over 100 , 7,000 basic right when they &apos;re hard to continue in e. coil in long longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to other ways . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , using dna repair , it can put together piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a microbial called tolerance radiation 球菌 can withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of images , in its chromosomes nieces in different places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will be back together again before their original form . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these microbes can totally out of water . they can live in a vacuum 
i was completely convinced that outer space that exists life , and move , in a new have water environment . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
here &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is a front mentioned yeast way and put through our right design pieces . yeast automatically will they aggregates . 
this is not an electron microscope picture ; it merely average optics microscope . 
it &apos;s such a big one molecule that we can use a optics microscope to look at it . 
these are long about 六秒 when images . 
this is what we open the recent experiment results . 
this is more than 580000 scripts long gene code . this is also by humans setting structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface not interval , it will print out . total need 142页 these genetic code to print . 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously with a virus is a very simple germ processing more complicated . 
as we deal with nuclear creatures that really itself as you can take a relatively simple tucked into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they &apos;re acting 连成 with the cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole transplant shift the chromosome from one cell into another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is breaks down here . but we try to bring this process design some more deeply . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we found all accepted second chromosomes species or from elsewhere third-party chromosomes , in a seconds increased 数千种 new feature to its own . 
what people would hold in the process of evolution every would only have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digesting the dna . 
the original cells chromosome without this enzyme without this enzyme when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it will its digest , finally , we have a new dna contains a cell . 
we put the gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original species feature all disappeared , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins all changed , also membrane changed -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , it actually is that we implantation . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we did get through to transfer of dna , to dramatically change things . 
now , i want to say it &apos;s not invasive century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we would create a new version of the cambrian explosion of big life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
our population going in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world becomes three people compared to us from 1946 in each one is people ; in the next 40 years , becomes within four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 for people to provide food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people make change 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil 一千万桶 . it &apos;s a day . 
when we try to think about this creature program or any can replace it program , it would be a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is this material in indicated by the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we found from around the world now has a contains approximately 两千万组 gene database , and i just love them as the future of design components . 
only 10 to the electric industry , and look kind of components that can get diversity . 
now , our main limits from biology reality and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because they can make we call the mixing “ chromosome group ” rapid synthetic approach . 
we now have the ability to create a large robots will allow us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is only criteria . we can choose to survive , the ability to choose , chemical production , or fuel vaccine manufacturing , etc . 
this is a screen is a screenshot cut some work when we actually sit in the computer to design species actually use software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code looks like . 
now to put our attention on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a terrible trial . 
soon we will have a second and third generations fuel . it &apos;s sugar into higher value fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
sunlight and co2 is one way -- 
( applause -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . in other ways . 
this is a microbial , 1996 by them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost in boiling water of life . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecules most its energy source . 
see whether we &apos;re able to collect the two has really , really convenient , they can be introduced processing stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry 化工 little target . &lt; applause -- if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tools made 几组 immediate vaccine . 
you &apos;re seeing this appears flu , we always have to slow last year in time and money , lack of cases they really useful vaccine . 
i think this situation is can mix vaccines were made to change . 
this is the future might present situation accompanied by changing the evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species of bacteria , 古物 last is really nuclear biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a far away and improve human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this ted u 09年 speak in the short , brian cox : shares some which super 对撞机 news . the content , including are now going to repair and it &apos;s a history of our biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
over the last ted introduced me to speak on the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to talk about update reality machine running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . let &apos;s in the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
we use to reinvent the universe forming billionth of a second per second when 6亿次 state of manufacturing and this one state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these detectors give some camera mini big bang . 
this is my installation that machine , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas process of building magnificent picture you can see huge scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is a picture of atlas shine down . 
it was the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first picture clusters particles go along the lhc . around like we &apos;re planning to with the lhc . part of particles in huge hit go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see here a in september 10号 spectacle we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know this is getting 满堂喝彩 or is this -- when people go to google , saw front page icons like time 
this suggests that we work with shock that causes a culture that same significant scientific shock 
but about a week later , we developed a machine error major with these 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they started a whole machine . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , those wires ” too narrow . 
they can do , because when they &apos;re extremely low temperature superconducting 导线 into . 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between temperature circumstances these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 on one mistake installed technology . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of a sudden they transmission 安培 current by resistance 
this is the results . 
very shocking , because those magnets weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
we have about 50 magnets damage . 
卸 must put them down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them aside spook , fix . 
now just waiting for them back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 refer to be the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , get data and continue our mission to find out that the universe forming basic units . 
now obviously , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task still with us my pursuit of facts itself , which is where the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

you &apos;re not afraid sustainable denial will bring you click collapse ?

you see , i was young , i get to 40 years old , you see , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years creative career 
frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i said that sentence and friends , right between heart is very likely , that i &apos;ve ever been the most successful . 
oh my god , it &apos;s kind of idea ! 
is this idea , incredible journey on a piano wine 大清早 drank way not to god is this idea , incredible journey on a 大清早 drank piano wine don &apos;t understand road , ah , i don &apos;t want to be .

i want to keep doing what i love writing career , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
after a deep thinking , in my opinion , to keep writing , i had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create some psychological protect mechanism . 
i need to somehow , establishing a safe distance difference itself , and i started writing for work outcry extreme anxiety difference itself , and i started writing for work outcry extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patience , hear me , because eventually be sent back to our problems . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred tense djinn from remote places , and you know , artist came around with a remote and no known purpose from remote places , and you know , artist came around with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call this kind of tense djinn accompanied by creativity for “ 守护神 ” 
people were prevalent to think socrates is such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him to think that general wisdom was that people socrates is such a 守护神 wisdom , from a distance to give him . 
people have similar ancient rome ideas , they put this kind of creative genius djinn called “ ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create djinn called “ ” genius 
this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” 聪慧 genius is a particular individual this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal . 
this idea which is fantastic , this is what i was looking at this safe distance , and that &apos;s what makes people from work 成败 impact psychological protect mechanism . 
we can understand its business model , isn &apos;t it ? 
ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass “ genius ” help do work . 
if you work pretty crappy , also not all you &apos;re wrong . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you &apos;re really bad ” “ genius 
this is westerners in the last very long time thinking about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
无异 asked him to swallow sun for vulnerable individual , it &apos;s too big , in terms of responsibility . 
this is a completely twisted people self cognition , and has led to personal achievement incredibly expand expect this radically distort a person self cognition , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years staving countless artists , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years staving countless artist . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think this is that our question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : are we going to do now ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off 抹杀 developed 500多年 rationality humanities ideas that we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off development 抹杀 500多年 rationality humanities ideas . 
well , maybe i can convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make us believe that you &apos;ve all had to sit on this side experience will know creative process doesn &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process than make sense

and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail 顺势 pull , put it back to the other hand , poetry on paper 誊写 顺势 pull , put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
whenever this sometimes , poetry can 完好无缺 to present on paper , except sequence is upside down , from the beginning , by the word after forward , until the first words . 
i heard her story , after thinking : crazy , and my creative process identical ! of course it &apos;s not my creative process of all , i &apos;m not a pipe , my job more like a so bad .

you know , i should say this situation , because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that shows . 
it seems , time stops dancer though across time seemed to be stopped , dancer though across the movement and what he did before 1000场 performance isn &apos;t anything different , but everything was amazingly unified up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , light from the inside of his life , from the bottom glow . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , light from the inside of his life , from the bottom of the light that he was sacred fire shine 
it was clearly , people know what it is , they can call out its name was clearly , people know what it is , they can call out its name . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge god . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing wondrous give , people will 喝彩 : arturo “ 欧 嘞 , la , la , arturo 欧 嘞 , really great , excellent , incredible ” that &apos;s good , there emerge god . 
this way , good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most intractable is morning , dancer 悠悠 turn up for artists , for the most intractable is morning , dancer 悠悠 turn up that tuesday morning was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there emerge of god . 
it &apos;s just that when bad leg , older people are going to van , and he might last night that couldn &apos;t get altitude . 
someone would probably never in his dance when gods 喝彩 good , there emerge from about how he should ? 
this is a very tricky issues creative process , which is the most painful cognitive of self . 
this is a very tricky issues creative process , which is the most painful self cognitive of this is a very tricky issues creative process , which is the most painful cognitive of self . 
but perhaps , we would have so much pain if you were never thought that wonderful artwork completely from you , if you were never thought that wonderful artwork completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 “ , you just need to do good work ” that part . 
don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 “ , you just need to do good work ” that part . 
in your 坚守 jobs , in whatever you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
in your 坚守 jobs , in whatever you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
if not , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , that you keep dancing , 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe that we must teach this one idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore here at ted global shows the new situation , think climate trend predictions worth more than scientists , and he worried that for “ clean coal ” gestures . 
al gore for recently climate trend warning . 
last year i &apos;ll give you two about shows the polar ice cap demo in the past 三百万年 equivalent of the size of south america 48 state area combined 缩减 40 . 
but they can &apos;t completely illustrate that question . because it doesn &apos;t mean out ice cap thickness . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s a good global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is a permanent 冻 ice 
you see , it &apos;s moving into winter dark blue is this year in annual ice formed permanent 冻 summer ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five or more long ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years time , it from here to here . 
notable is around the arctic ocean warming makes 受热 冻土 layer , and there &apos;s lots of being 冻 sealed carbon &#91; when &#93; 干冰 解冻 compost methane , carbon form microbes . 
if breakthrough top points , greenhouse gas emissions atmosphere is going to have total global warming pollution . 
some of the lake in alaska in shallow water 探头 already you can see the 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 went to a shallow lake . 
wow . 
she was very good , us ? 
one reason , the boreal deposition a heat heating greenland . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but all traffic was larger than 往年 
this is greenland southwest kangerlussuaq the river . 
if you want to understand the land of ice melts how to make rising 入海口 here it is . 
here are rising 急速 traffic . 
antarctica , the other end of this planet biggest ice 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica suddenly found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melting 
that &apos;s equivalent to sea level on 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see a new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
global 40 from its molten water get half of the water . 
in the ice 安第斯 mountains , this is the city of drinking water . 
that are growing traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , assuming is very serious . 
global dry that are causing fires number radically increased 
and the world of disasters in absolute numbers are significantly increase in speed quite unprecedentedly . 
in the last 30 years time period , 总数 reached earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable patterns . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we day increases 七千万吨 co2 emissions 两千五百万吨 co2 into the ocean . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west in india times continent 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
most of the greenhouse effect , except for 20 percent of forest destruction is burning fossil fuels . 
oil , coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions one nation , and china . 
build a solution was to use more coal carbon planet . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see a sea change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative solutions . 
( applause -- but , in our country has a political war . 
carbon and oil and coal industries in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth , in my hometown of tennessee digging 淤泥 billions of liters of coal . 
you probably saw on the news 
here , is the second big wastewater reductions put 
in christmas back and forth this happen . 
there &apos;s a kind of coal advertising carbon industry . 
mr. cool coal is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see his fertile more productive , he also helped us economic development . 
coal cool mr. every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of coal , west virginia original 产地 
most of the coal mining &apos;s head of massey 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore is one of the president now formed and launched two projects . 
this is one part of that one . 
in coalergy very seriously , we treat climate change for our careers threat . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to set our initial goal explaining coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , coal not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , without for global warming and worry . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s go like art normal clean coal factory . 
some spectacular machine 喧哗 ! 
but this is the sound of clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , the main reasons here you can see the clean coal fascinated exciting technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now clean coal technology . 
this is a final solution can handle the economic challenge and national security challenges . 
and in the u.s. national security and economic crisis , the climate crisis . 
will these crisis all strings together for us is based on carbon oil products on like dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solution to solve these problems . 
america repower using 100 percent renewable electricity use a time . 
americans new work to get to our lives more safe , and let the earth is not warming . 
eventually , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
to understand more repower america . 
the last one . 
this is about repower america . 
the old dirty oil are murder our planet is that allow us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
the future is here . wind , solar energy , a new network . 
new investment to create more money there &apos;s lots of jobs . 
america repower . it &apos;s time to dream well ! 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to walk faster , independent ago . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first , i want you to remember that you &apos;re being a kid era played kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to operate , is actually when you &apos;re thinking and learning how to solve problems . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand objects 空间结构 really helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
and this question would be in my mind , so we decided to find answers , so to have this infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable interaction is a computer , a big cookie size as small . 
we can use siftables hand voluntary movements , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like kit , as you can bring music . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information manipulation tools . 
this operation tools more independent , more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any fine-grain mobile , so we can use this tool try something new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to demonstrate some simple . 
this is like 映 siftable allocation , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows images tilted towards here also , if i put it in the opposite direction , then images tilt also tilted towards the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a 挨 a out ok , interesting phenomenon will happen . 
if you just a bunch of them , they &apos;ll also aware , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves each other and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction through some -- we can use to interact with gestures and siftables upside down , such as color from a liquid that put another piece siftable siftable dumped . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel set paint siftables model , we can put these barrel pour color in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if you pour more , you can go back again a few . 
and machine learning siftables function , can be used to learn language , count arithmetic wait -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 faster , see the results . 
this is also , i &apos;m here to show siftables reason -- and applause -- this is me with a simple equation made of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix spell word games . 
that playing games together words law mainly as down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together as words , it will be in the dictionary siftables automatically find words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spelling out to change the sequence shows letters , make the right word , you can also try to use other letters to build new words . 
( applause . thank you . 
( applause -- now , the screen that shows some kids are in the media lab because siftables participate in the test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , playing games together words that when we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , this is a game ” “ spell words , when they know how to do this . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner this woman is age youngest people experience . 
he just wants to put siftables pile together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now the screen that is an animation function interact try . 
we hope to become siftables learn language people . 
image on the kid called felix . 
he can put some new add elements to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animated graphics voted image , you can bring these new add elements to animation on . 
see , he put the sun add up . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
orange tractors . 
do good ! 
put siftables shake it towards animated graphics can bring new element to add to the image on his new elements add up -- dogs 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open-source ending story , he &apos;s planning to develop stories plot . 
cat sitting balloon off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function , but in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables enshrined in this feature aspects , can send out sound like 超载 tone and bess and drum voice . 
there could be staring every modules 四档 regulate , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound editors modules siftable joined by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors near modules module . 
there are similar 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles near sound modules can adjust sound . 
so , we can use to control overall rhythm and volume of siftable modules near editor of siftable modules to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take 超载 tone into two editors , again , plus some tiles 超载 sounds . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now take filter acoustic tile near drums modules , it can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to put some simply rhythm accelerated pace modules near edit module . 
now let &apos;s put filter acoustic tile near shellfish shree modules filter voice . 
music playing in the process , we can recreate 编排 . 
so we don &apos;t need to have 编排 playing in real time , but when you can play , but long text . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited near modules modules , using this appeared on the left . 
( applause . thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;m here to show the siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
