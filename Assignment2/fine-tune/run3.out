and through pictures rapture purpose and stories , the national geographic explorers by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these culture is an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same an adaptive rules . 
we are all born into 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different perspectives will let you see hope 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture intertwined life and the internet to cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also a strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
as biosphere by severe erosion ethnic circles as also facing the same shorter and its destruction faster 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live in the original on this planet have 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is shining human spirit . 
it &apos;s all solid spirit unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we all the same number of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no 传人 that unless we measures of effective , they will completely disappeared . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be talking final 本族语 who couldn &apos;t tell the wisdom of our children are not allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
another spooky on earth is in fact , about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore this race loop loop race to give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people have forgot the front , and i said “ survival ” in front of a different way , i said “ ” different ways to survive . 
for example this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 barry played methuselah -- they &apos;re called 蚺 areas that the race because they believe in a legends 米尔克 from that they were born in the sacred river 东岸 allow it . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 forest , and so , in their opinion 天穹 with the forest canopy and no difference . 
they say , with a weird language , a unique and follow the rules that 通婚 called linguistics 异族 通婚 to drive a them with a different languages , married people . 
this is the mythology of historical lineage and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . a 大家族 often have 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
i once in contact with the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing race in 1958 years earlier , i used to that they had peace friendly . 
1957 missionary five years to approach them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the sky eight to 十张 they himself in the photo we think this is the friendly means , but they don &apos;t think these people who live in 雨林中 never seen a two-dimensional . 
they pick up the forest from these pictures and images to get over to these people trying to find the person , but they found nothing . and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 this missionary five died . 
more terror is not only 戮 华拉尼 external people died . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is death by their own 戮 to die . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally goes out to the truth . it will be more 年迈 wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , to the forest , they have astonishing 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell predator 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is animals urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between 
born in the soul . 
the dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 below the soul to just replace the living soul in this brief moment 侍僧成 shining for god . 
so voodoo believers , like say you go to church worship to call god . 
we dance to be in the temple . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . why would get hurt ? 
i was exposed to all of those groups in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 科基人 the mountains of the most remarkable . 
this is the ancient civilization race tyranny of descent , they were once conquered and takes over the columbia coast in plain the caribbean 此后 they go back to the coast plains of an isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent that race was never spaniard conquered . 
and today , they get along with monk 续 would rule institutions , but they monk 训诫 very unique . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain values is the relationship between the believers in the universe we can call it the ecology of balanced . 
here &apos;s how beautiful that you need to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 call for 弟兄 we say we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to create a very important . 
you would not 多愁善感 aboriginal people also can &apos;t afford the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this symbol is important meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia , grew up in the local people &apos;s thoughts . i think is going to be logging in the woods . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this picture are me this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often used it did die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain with five 羟 color is the 成份 very close . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribal person would contain from five 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you use a nose sucked into powder that you will see 光怪陆离 hallucinations in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distort it were totally wiped out 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organ in a single is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have to change and oral alone is 氧化酶 living as other chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that exist in 藤本植物 β -- 咔 啉 can inhibit actually alone is 氧化酶 and play the color is so potent 不由得 you want to ask myself . 
when we do all kinds of experiments constantly measure outcomes are wrong 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person species found in the cane is they all die in the deep jungle in that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants are not talking about me . 
i told you that if they said in the night 17 months round things that grow every plant to use the different little word singing to you . 
and this discovery is not going to let you get harvard ph.d. , but it &apos;s much more accounting 报表 more fun 
dh : now we have this question , though , some of our compassion tragedy aboriginal people think they 离群索居 丰富多彩 life , but the world as we develop these people in step forward to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been threatened by new way of life as a strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is great sioux nation indians and americans 骑马 to go and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat race 完整性 layer is not change or technological innovation itself , but power is barbaria up his ideas . 
let &apos;s look at the mountains tibet recently where i made a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal oppressed . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide endangered cultures , which is destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce in many places it even considered by part of this strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet withstand 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
chinese invasion immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 成份 by 关押 and family . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and was sent to 学习班 behavior . 
one day she accidentally hit has to have hair &apos;s head of the 臂章 and be guilty about seven years of a nation to accept 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to withstand human redemption mental need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
we think of the human in the world already exist in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 era for human revolution in our agricultural age , he went to the top of the seed girl 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra for cheese 祭 after we created this level of 社会分工 that only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history have enough that we have the ability to solve the millennium facing challenges . 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to recognize that we have to make sure that all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the top , and then i made some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people tell me about tells a story of his grandfather legendary 
in the 1950s canada government is not always practice inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old man refused to move . 
his family worried that his security put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , which is their days alone , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 packet 冻 made out of the fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he slept outside wearing his seal leather 长裤 he put your hand to pull stool when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into shape blades . 
and in this shit put into the blades puke on the edge 口水 wait frozen after it becomes very robust and then he put 刀子 宰杀 with this dog . 
dogs bark 剥 down into a 挽具 his chest and take the dog sleds condom made to the other dog between when to stop the knife made out of that put shit in ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways dh : these are inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 canada government to a area than texas and california &apos;s largest 之和 area of land returned back to inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is very good example , a country that could do something with it managed to repair the relationship between the people . 
and finally , i think for ever in this world some remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent branches of human imagination dates back to the origin of the ancient times for all of us , for these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think jt debate is not to convince other people , but we think by telling the truth to make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s good at talking about facts institutions our website click of a month for about three to five 百万次 thousands of 
we 156 channels of play in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from online picky . using a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of scenes , and can navigate it . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
we see here is so many many gb 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can continue to zoom in , and smooth mapping can browse them by the way , you can do to rearrange them . 
no matter how many have seen data sets , images have much itself and image how big seadragon , all have that kind of processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system , the only factor is just , you use the screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is what the dickens had 荒凉 山庄 line , &quot; is chapter of content . 
i gave you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 is a picture of the opening . 
and the paper , or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , when people get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change issues in this &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you see a normal commercial resolution higher , in a lot of images into the extra content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way to an extent , averted screen actually used the area limits . 
we want this technology will reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , technology applications for this map is obvious , number one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field of our contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this technology already online , you can go about their experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually blending two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from the university of washington graduate noah snavely undertake computer visual research findings . the research also get steve seitz washington university . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got applied seadragon , it &apos;s based on technology building . 
you can see , we have access to have multiple ways of looking at pictures and images , to make the subtlety 剖析 and have more resolution browse experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually a very meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there are many examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , going to take care of legal issues . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by 串联 up in space . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would end to work for microsoft 
this is pretty amazing welcome , really happy . 
i think you can see these first images from a lot of different camera : from the mobile phone camera into a single professional backwards . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment was put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 pictures , etc . 
i remember here should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to the poster to see the rebuilding of the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can use effectively online community with everyone . we can get data to everybody for different environmental memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , all the secondary out to all gather much more than just up . 
this model can secondary out , is the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler virtual earth &quot; &quot; the long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and to become more valuable . 
user picture , you will be 注 tag on . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the years to global images from 接合 together ? 
the software . this is the real meaning , is to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this process is entirely 接合 images based on the content . 
more exciting images that contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you go online and in that picture , the key word later , page text will contain with this image of the relevant information . 
now , suppose you all these pictures and images together , that would be like ? 
now , so these semantic information to each other and volume of links is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you ! 
thank you very much . 
barry 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about this book of content hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know exactly what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a recognized creed of going up . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 笃信 疑 principles . 
well , this is to say this : if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to make personal freedom to maximize . 
why is this thing and freedom in itself is good and valuable , for people are essential . 
and once people had freedom , each of us can 做主 ourselves with all the way the big enough to get welfare , people don &apos;t have to work for me were 做主 . 
and the freedom to do a lot to do is the largest increase fully selective . 
people more choices , it &apos;s more freedom , freedom , getting more and more that welfare . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that deep-rooted that nobody would want to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples of modern society &apos;s advance development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my house , near a supermarket . not very big . 
i just want to talk about this salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one and a pop-up stores allocation sound system -- voice box conclusion , cd machine conclusion , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
with this store components that you can have a close 650万种 out all the combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer to telephone service , which had to go to the bell , just a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , the telephone is going to die are not bad . 
that already 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially mobile . yuyu shows cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 -- that will take mp three playing machine , nose cutting hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , with no pretty soon , you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people went to the store , and you ask : is there a without so much function ? &quot; 
you want , what would answer ? 
answer is no ” “ . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a not so many things stem cell phone . 
again , in life in some more than any other shopping to affect us on this thing , the same choice bang existed . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , doctors straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 solutions . 
and so forth nail solution turned out there and risk . 
and so forth 乙 solution turned out there and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
the psychiatrist says again , nail has these things and risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , that you choose ” ? 
the psychiatrist says , but i was not “ ” you . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for the ordinary people around you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s saying , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why are we doing to their marketing campaign ? 
answer is , they wanted us to see the morning after the ads would go to your doctor , to the doctor to call the prescription drugs put in them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now our gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by themselves to invent . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you today , you &apos;re going to do a kind of men and women -- and make decisions . 
in marriage family ways , in the past everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is of course , and that &apos;s 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices and who &apos;s married , rather than when node , it &apos;s not married , after doing . 
and today , about everything that can take to pick 拣 挑拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart bright students , but now i give them all placed homework time less than one fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever before -- students stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so who . 
now the reason is their brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask yourself : i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is it going right now ? 
and after that ? i was trying to start to kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do all placed my homework , whether they also in my class take a what grades . 
they really should go to these questions , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day of any time , in any one corner of the earth work -- and of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place can wifi , but i don &apos;t tell you the where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible chose liberal bring us is we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now to work for himself was moved to break or so . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 with all the phone , another 裤兜 installed in with their blackberry &#91; knee &#93; blackberry , and with the laptops . 
even though they are locked up , we still looking at in 场上 rivals for children and constantly ask myself , i still don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to this email or not ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this an 信稿 ? 
even if you give their answer is no , you for children and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether big thing , or the small things matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we used to live in the world is this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not 事事 need are choices . 
and today we live in the world is this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
one , some say up an oxymoron , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us is not liberating , but inside , is paralysis . 
so many people have the choice to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a story about peer-to-peer pension plan investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to recorded vanguard of investment . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
she survey found is that when these customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is about two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 fund 10 percent , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s preferably , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to a lot of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , too many choices , possibilities , the results were numb rigid . 
it makes us into the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make decisions is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where do you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation is wrong , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the more easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make choices . 
secondly , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost of things . 
earlier today , dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have many choices to think , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you quit to attract people aspect . and that makes you always chosen to you that think 美中不足 . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , if i take a 歉 . 
but this is now you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
gorgeous beach , sunlight 明媚 , they have all this . 
it can be better than this ? this is where it thinking “ huh , really bad , ” “ is now in august , ” . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home , ” 
i &apos;m going to be back “ can put the car stop in my own front ” . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost percent better chance in the parking . 
“ opportunity cost ” always has enabled us to make a decision not even with the decision actually quite 英明 . 
we have options more attractive in these options that are more , and all these things became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also says “ out in the present whatsoever ” this principle . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step here . 
but , of a truth is , when you chose to do something , and that you have chosen not to do other things . 
these other things tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this point in time , i have to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time to wash enough , after a million times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , wore it many years old pants , i finally 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and said , you have to type 紧身 , comfort type , was 宽松 for ? 
in front of it is to pull 扣子 locked ? 石磨 and acid wash ? 
going that fast grind breaking ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw nearly fall down . i have to wait 缓 , my god , i &apos;m going to ask “ that was the only one ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is , because there are so many can choose for a sex , my jeans what should have more good to be greatly good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a while , i didn &apos;t expect that too . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the best at least have a 极致 is perfect . 
and that &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i expect compare , and i expect than this line up , i became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond doesn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize and less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
there &apos;s nobody to market understand this principle . because if they know there &apos;s a person , and you don &apos;t have the opportunity to know what is this idea . i mean cartoons . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in all these things are bad past everything better than now . 
and the reason why is that when one of the things that are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every object the more you will only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
you will never be what surprises , because what you expect me than day and high . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so i want to do it by applause -- a bit of time on to myself , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now obviously the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
on out there with hundreds of jeans , no excuse put things you might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that decided to achieve results good they are still &#91; to &#93; disappointed , decided to blame myself . 
in the past of our generation , the industrialized world and the developed world -- clinical repressed disorder explosive growth . 
and the net effect is the objective , although we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this &#91; choose to bring happiness -- the standard principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no doubt choose to better than no choice , but not conclusion that choice more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we choose the richest ‘ ’ needs the critical value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that has so much choice , is a huge abundance of matter . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least we heard a few of those problems , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so here i talk about this topic is modern western societies on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we produced those expensive and very difficult to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just in waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , these expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really bring us harm . 
they actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 thomas improve practice . 
products redistribution will allow all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess choice . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in this fish in everything is impossible ” . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , is to interpret it . 
but i think , the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs such a “ ” fish . 
in this fish -- and you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective : we &apos;re working on digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from those numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life ” “ , i think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , and it from the biological world computer simulation analysis entered the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate out of genes from 500组 一百组 is our current these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study is the synthetic chromosomes , so we can change its components to continue to question these basic problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never succeeded overlarge of molecules ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , by the way down , just some topless live sexual chemistry . 
our digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it still growing . we &apos;re going to put in recent speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact it through a couple steps . we do in the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , the more fragmented long , made a mistake that much more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first try from phi x 174 , &#91; of &#93; genome bacteriophage digital information started . 
is a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the most exciting period is when we put this video there live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles and back to kill the e. coli &#91; 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some of the oil industry , and i think they communicate this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this is actually software is able to build a biological system within our own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that these numbers to be very accurate information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , right , gene sequencing is the standard per 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , on average , in sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design work is part of the design 50 character and the length of time and other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units of time . we need to design before they get together . 
and one of the unique part of that we design . 
you may have heard in which we add 水印 . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 the body -- and these scripts 编成 about 20 amino acids , each of these amino acids , have a badge . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we created these snippet and can use to cut enzyme 裁 . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , from 7000 character length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character length of time and pull 几组 snippet merger , 72 7,000 into a long time . 
in each stage , we train these images from a vast and so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very big piece , over 100 people in their basic when it &apos;s hard to keep in e. coil in long longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there are a little radiation 球菌 microbes is able to withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original form . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , moving around , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is a front mentioned yeast way and put it in the right after we design pieces . yeast automatically , will they aggregates . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
these are long , about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the recent experiment results . 
this is more than 580000 character long genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface no distance , it will print out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is a very simple process bacteria more complicated . 
like ourselves with this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a tucked into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole transplant cells from the chromosome from one to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process stop there . but we try to bring this process design some more deeply . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we found all accepted second chromosomes species or from elsewhere in the third side chromosome , one second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
what people were held by the time in the process of evolution would only have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of organisms . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digest dna . 
the original cell without this enzyme enzyme without it , and when we add in a have this enzyme chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it &apos;s going to its digest , finally , we have a new dna contains a cell . 
we put in gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original characteristics of all species disappear , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , actually , is that we put into it . 
this might sound like 炼金术 genes , but we really can move through dna , and to radically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not invasive century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of big life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
our population will in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to each of us from 1946 ; there are people in the next 40 years , becomes within four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
nine billion people to change that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this biological process or any can replace it program , it would be a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is this material in indicated by the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world that had a contains about 两千万组 genetic database , and i like to see them as the future of design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to kind of components , so let &apos;s get diversity . 
now , our main limit from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because this is what we can build “ mix chromosomes group ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to build a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is just standard . we can choose to survive , the ability to choose , or chemical production vaccine manufacturing fuel , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit at work in the computer to design species actually use software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what their genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 ” fuel . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it &apos;s sugar into higher value of the fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months to get our first 第四代 fuel . 
sunlight and carbon dioxide is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . in other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is its energy source . 
we &apos;re able to see whether to collect these two has , very convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry 化工 . and little goals applause -- if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there are probably ? became a major energy . 
and we are using the same tool making a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you can see the emergence of this year &apos;s flu , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine for change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species of bacteria , 古物 is really the nuclear biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 ted u short of the presentation , brian cox : which shares some super 对撞机 news . the content , including are now do the maintenance and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to update it on to the machine running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
used to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these detectors for mini some camera big bang . 
this is i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas process of building magnificent scale , you can see huge . 
last september 10日 we first started this one machine . 
this is a atlas shine down . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first picture clusters of particles around the lhc . along the way , as we have to plan with the lhc . part of particles in huge hit go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 this spectacle , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 or is this -- when people go to google , saw that graph is front page . 
this suggests that we work with shock that cause the culture of it as significant scientific shock 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the main 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they started machine . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , those wires ” too narrow . 
they can do , because when it becomes very low superconducting 导线 them . 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between the temperature of the cases these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 install technology has a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises that it is a little bit of a sudden they transmission 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , get data and continue our mission to find out that the universe , basic units . 
now obviously , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task still with us for the fact that my itself , which is where the value of the lhc . 
thank you . 
elizabeth gilbert , about creativity and create 呵护 reduce stress . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life work a specific event happened , however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event that i have to rethink i and my job relationship . 
it turns out , and no matter where i think , people all my life . this is the result is that , no matter where i now , people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , play 完了 ! 
they would be very to come up to me and said , “ you not afraid ? no . you &apos;ve ever that are not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s really going to comfort people ! 
i &apos;ve confronted at the same question , people say , you not afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair , full of dying in the failed 苦痛 i was always get that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know not to . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , talking about fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? but , talking about fear of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people afraid of doing their own destiny work ? it logical ? 
nobody says : “ john , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ” ? 
never would ask this happened . 
of course , 平心而论 chemical engineers , a group that doesn &apos;t in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of the century , every field great creativity wizards 英年早逝 case just look at the early years of the century , every field wizards 英年早逝 great creativity is always the case age gently died of suicide 
they don &apos;t even suicidal , often don &apos;t fully shows their talent that are not even suicidal , often don &apos;t fully shows their brilliance 
and the 曼梅 le , died in front of the interview last time i said , “ every book all 蚕食 ” part of me . 
for your life &apos;s work , this is how radical statement . 
i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
all of you think this sentiment ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even a little bit further away at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 
this view , and not only 可憎 scary , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this view , and not only 可憎 scary , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century this view , and not only 可憎 scary , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative wizards to live to be more . 
and just for myself , believed that i certainly going into the dark 绝境 and just for myself , believed that i certainly going into the dark 绝境 especially in my career at stage , especially in my career so far . 
you see , i was young , i just for 40 years old , you see , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years of career creativity 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say is between the heart , and friends . this is probably me in my life , this is the biggest successes is over . 
oh my god , it &apos;s kind of idea ! 
is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , i don &apos;t want to be like that . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to keep doing what i love writing career , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to keep doing what i love writing career , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , i had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create some psychological protect mechanism . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance away from writing itself , and i work for extreme anxiety open outcry from writing itself , and i work for responses extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because to end sent back to our problems . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred tense elves from remote places , and you know , artist came around with a remote and you know from distant and purpose is to know where the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creativity djinn tense for “ 守护神 ” 
and for people to think socrates have such a 守护神 from a distance , he was giving people to think that general wisdom socrates have such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him wisdom 
the roman people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius djinn called “ ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 individuals . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people from work 成败 psychological protect mechanism . 
we all can understand its business model , right ? 
ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass “ genius ” help work done . 
if you work pretty crappy , also not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is westerners in the last very long time thinking about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , which is too big . 
it completely straight up twisted people a sense of cognitive , and has led to personal achievement incredibly expanding expected it completely straight up twisted people a sense of cognitive , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years to kill countless artist and i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think is this so the question is : are we going to do now ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : are we going to do now ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to older , they used to reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to older , they used to reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 抹杀 18 minutes off the development of the human mind 500多年 reason we can &apos;t use a short talk 18 minutes , 抹杀 off developed 500多年 rational human mind . 
maybe i could not convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make us believe in you &apos;ve all had to sit on this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath and the really towards her . 
she could feel it , because it &apos;s a piece of energy would 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
she could feel it , because it &apos;s a piece of energy would 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
now , when she was the only thing to do only one thing with her words , is to 狂奔 ” “ 死命 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : sometimes she said she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail 顺势 pull , put it back to the other hand side poetry 誊写 on paper 顺势 pull , put it back to the other hand side poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper , except sequence is upside down , from the beginning , the last word go by , until after the first words . 
i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s unbelievable , and my creative process identical ! of course it &apos;s not my creative process of all , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 occasionally , as i will also inadvertently get incredible inspiration , but even 古板 occasionally , as i will also inadvertently get incredible inspiration .

this is exactly what happened ?

i hope that the historical record today : i 尽责 to 坚守 my jobs € today , i hope that the historical record : i 尽责 坚守 jobs to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they were great professional dancer who show a wonderful , because they were great professional dancer 
occasionally , although very unlikely , but actually happen at a dancer going beyond present 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i should say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that shows . 
it seems , time stops dancers crossed seemed as though time had stopped , across the dancer like he did . and before the 1000场 performance isn &apos;t anything different , but everything was amazingly unified up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life , from the bottom , light from the inside . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was sacred fire shine 
now , people know exactly what it is , they can call out its name was clearly , people know what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some incredible wondrous give , people will 喝彩 : arturo “ la , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 , arturo la , really great , excellent ” incredible , which is good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up that tuesday morning was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there emerge of god . 
and just that when bad leg , older people are going to go and van , he might last night , couldn &apos;t reach that level . 
maybe will never in his when somebody dance 喝彩 god emerge from good , there he is going to do ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
this is a very smart questions , and the creative process of self , one of the most painful cognition , this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
but maybe we were all suffering , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this point , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do good work ” your that part . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do good work ” your that part . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach this one idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore on ted global shows the new situation , climate trend that &apos;s worth more than scientists , and he worried that for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore climate trend for recently warning . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last thing in the area of the equivalent of the american south 48 state area combined 缩减 40 percent . 
but they can &apos;t completely illustrate that question . because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
it feels like the polar ice cap -- just like a good global climate system beating heart 
the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is 冻 permanent ice 
you see , it &apos;s moving into the dark blue is every winter annual ice formed in summer 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five or more years of ice you see , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that allow the arctic ocean warming around 受热 冻土 layer , and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 sealed carbon and 解冻 干冰 -- when methane , carbon microbes compost . 
if the breakthrough points , greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere is going to have total global warming pollution . 
some of the lake in alaska in shallow water 探头 already see the 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 went to a shallow lake . 
wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the boreal deposition a heat heating greenland . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it has to be better than traffic 往年 . 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of how to make ice melts , sea levels rising here is its 入海口 
here are rising 急速 traffic . 
the other side of the earth antarctica , the largest ice on the planet . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world from its molten water get half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of drinking water . 
that are growing traffic . 
but when they disappear , and we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
global dry that are causing fires in numbers . 
and the number of disasters , it &apos;s quite unprecedentedly with absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years time period , 总数 reached earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we day increases 七千万吨 co2 emissions 两千五百万吨 co2 to the oceans . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the continent 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of the big reasons , except for 20 percent of forest destruction is burning fossil fuels . 
oil , coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions one nation , and china . 
the solution is to build a use more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative . 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
before and after christmas , my home in tennessee digging billions of coal 淤泥 liters . 
you may have seen in the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
this is a before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of carbon -- coal industries . 
coal mr. cool is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive , and he helped us economic development . 
coal mr. cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
there is west virginia , a lot of coal waste 产地 . 
the biggest is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore is one of the president now formed and launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to set our initial goal explaining the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , why don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal factory . 
some 喧哗 spectacular machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now the clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security challenges . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , the climate crisis 
will the crisis is strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products on like dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve the problem of projects . 
america repower with 100 percent renewable electricity use a time . 
americans new work to get us to live more safe , and let the earth is not warming . 
finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the last one . 
this is about repower america . 
the old dirty oil are murder our planet is that allow us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
here &apos;s the future , wind and solar energy , a new network . 
new investment to create more money there &apos;s lots of jobs . 
repower america &apos;s wishes come true . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember about being a kid you at age played kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to do , is actually when you &apos;re learning how to think about and problem solving . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that 空间结构 really helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , therefore the infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable interacting with a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
siftables could randomly moved by hand , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as with legos could randomly . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information manipulation tools . 
this individual operating tools more and more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any slight mobile , so we can use this tool try something new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to demonstrate some simple . 
there &apos;s this siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , so it &apos;s indicated in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , then images tilt also tilted towards the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a 挨 out a good , interesting phenomenon will happen . 
and if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves each other and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures and siftables , like a liquid that put down from a color siftable into another piece siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel set paint patterns of siftables , we can put these barrel into color in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it much , can you go back a few . 
siftables and machine learning function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , chef -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , faster that result . 
this is also , i &apos;m here to show siftables reason -- and applause . this is a simple equation i use a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
spell this word play a game act as down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together as words , it will be in the dictionary siftables automatically find words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spelling out to change the sequence shows , make the right word , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
( applause . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because siftables participate in the test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this game play together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them that &apos;s a “ spell ” word games , then they know how to do this . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this woman is age , the smallest experience . 
he just wanted to siftables pile together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now i have on the screen a animation function interact try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the children &apos;s felix . 
he could use some new add elements to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animation images vote image , you can bring these new to add elements on it . 
see , he took the sun add up . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
orange tractors . 
do good ! 
put that in animation siftables shake images that can bring new add elements to image on his new element to add up -- 吠 dogs . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he &apos;s planning what story unfolding plot . 
the cat balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables function that into sound domain , can make like 超载 tone and bess and drum voice . 
every modules 四档 there could be staring regulate , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there &apos;s something like 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles tiles near sound can adjust voices . 
so , we can use to control master rhythm and volume siftable modules near the end of the modules siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the two tiles 超载 into edit , and then add some 超载 sounds . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now take filter acoustic tile near drums modules , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to accelerate rhythm some just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now let &apos;s put a close to the acoustic tile shellfish tiles sound filter . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s based on play , over time , but long and short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited near modules tiles on the left , with the place . 
( applause . thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want you to interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 of technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
