through rapture picture , and the story of national geographic explorers by wade davis celebrate the extraordinary biodiversity aboriginal culture , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same kind of adaptive . 
we are born in 母腹 and in this 生儿育女 in the world . 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl , sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance in 排遣 life 苦楚 we create art . 
but you can see the rhythm of culture song and dance rhythm , has unique . 
all these communities show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 . 
if you thinking about , you can now send this different thinking will let you see hope 
the world of a cultural 五彩缤纷 犹如 by mental life and culture intertwined in the life of the earth with it for the earth &apos;s 芸芸众生 with very important point as we call the internet as the biosphere . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity . it &apos;s a very strong , we have the ability to look at the species . 
as a biosphere by the end of the rings and with the same shorter destruction , and it faster . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet , there were six : 00 language 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is the human spirit shining 
it &apos;s all the mental actually unique culture in the material world 承 dictionary . 
each one is a language is a conscious mind and a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate . 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we in the audience as the number of these languages in half no longer to teach kids 
these language has no 传人 do that unless it works they will completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . people don &apos;t have to pass on the way our intelligence for kids don &apos;t predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
and it &apos;s a terrible on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 and this is a language with old . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore this race to loop loop let you in a big to understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
it &apos;s a lot of people have forget the front , and i said “ different way of living ” i said “ different way of ” . 
for example this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 of -- they played methuselah area called that the 蚺 race because they believe in a time , they come from the 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of the forest , they 栖身 , so they , in the forest canopy 天穹 and didn &apos;t . 
they said , with a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 called 异族 通婚 a went to the people with a different languages married . 
this is the mythology of legacy of history , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
i was in contact with the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing race early years , i was in 1958 , and they had to peace . 
five missionary 1957 years trying to get these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they have in the next eight to 十张 they himself in the picture we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think these people live in 雨林中 never seen two-dimensional . 
they from the forest pick up these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people , but what they found that the person , and so they don &apos;t think this is a call to devil the cards , and they use with spears 戮 dead that five evangelist . 
and it &apos;s not just the 华拉尼 戮 at people . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is death by their own people 戮 . 
we have to 一个八代 宗谱 survey found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the more people out of the 年迈 . it &apos;s going to wood , they &apos;ll 戮 he 送终 for him . 
on the other hand , they have to forest and 惊诧 perspective . 
their predator can smell several hundred yards away 40 a animals smell urine and know that &apos;s what the urine . 
to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark have the magic . 
instead , this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions 
voodoo the unique about it is in life , and the connection between 
the soul in life . 
the dance with the rhythm can 大水 翩翩起舞 to the soul of just replace the soul of life in the short shining 侍僧成 for the moment . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we dance in a cathedral . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
in my exposed to all of the community in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 of 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is the tyranny in ancient civilization descent , they were once conquered and take over the columbia coast in plain the 此后 they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody continent 肆虐 this race has never been the spanish people . 
and to their 续 today in the system will monk . but they monk 训诫 very unique . 
they like to go back to 母腹 have been taught the values that maintain these values , and with the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it beautiful . 
they call themselves for 兄长 call for 弟兄 we say we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to create a very important . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain shelter , or god is a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s a symbol that this is a relationship with nature . 
i &apos;m british columbia , grew up in the forest , local people &apos;s thoughts . i think is going to forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this is a picture i last in august in northwest amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 dead on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 use it to make -- dead on water psychedelic drugs . 
this is a plant potent is it in the color of the brain five -- 羟 color is 成份 very close to . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribe , people are from with five -- 羟 color is plants extract this and it took crack nose . 
if you use the nose of the powder , you &apos;ll see these 光怪陆离 in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you , but not distorted were totally wiped out 
but the color is matter doesn &apos;t oral because they will be in the organ in a single is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have to change and oral is 氧化酶 live in the other chemicals . 
and there &apos;s this 藤本植物 of β -- 咔 啉 to control the single is 氧化酶 and play the color is working 不由得 so you have to ask ourselves 
when we do all kinds of experiments , and make mistakes and measure . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is they &apos;re all in the jungle in that we think they &apos;re different . 
if you ask them to a hierarchy is how these plants and they said , i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants . i don &apos;t know , is 
i tell you that if they said in the months circle night in the things that grow every plant in different little , singing to you . 
this that you don &apos;t have to get at harvard university ph.d. , but it &apos;s far more than accounting 报表 have fun . 
now . we have a problem that even though we some of the aboriginal people had thought of compassion 离群索居 丰富多彩 their lives , but as we move the development of these people in the back to history . 
and all cultures have new life by the way an shock . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is the great sioux nation and the people who 骑马 to go and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
and the threat 完整性 race not change or technological innovation , it &apos;s the power of it all up robust . 
we take of tibet recently where i do a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
and genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide . it &apos;s cultural destruction of the way people live without denounce 行径 by in many places it even be a part of this strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese people immediately , he was killed . 
his uncle and other together to nepal fled . 
his mother because 富农 family 成份 and be 关押 . 
he was only two and his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding dress and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and was sent to 学习班 . 
one day she not to be stuck on a hair &apos;s head of the 臂章 and to be about seven years of a nation 劳教 guilty . 
the pain of tibet for people to take human redemption need to get to see . 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need to a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
think about it , we have in the 10,000 year in the world . it &apos;s going to make us feel . 
新石器 revolution into agriculture , human time to time , we seed girl , he went to the 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra of 祭 for for we create the level of this and 社会分工 only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial social only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history , and we have enough to get to the future to solve the face of challenge . 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 a different . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to find as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely species to recognize that we have to make sure that all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the top . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 to the people i talk about a about his grandfather legendary story . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , and the government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we put them to make 定居点 away by . 
this is the old man refused to move . 
his family that he put his all safe , weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear them cold , this is my it alone . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man and not the fear of the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he sleep outside wearing his skin his seal 长裤 to pull on stool to when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this shit made to the edge of the blades make 口水 and frozen after it becomes very solid , he used it to a dog 刀子 宰杀 . 
the skin 剥 dog made a 挽具 he and his dog made out of a dog sleds to another to between when that don &apos;t have to do it in the shit ice sheet . 
this is a really 空手 life . 
in many ways . this is the inuit people on all of the indigenous 顽强 living real 写照 . 
1999 four months to canada than the size of california and texas area 之和 to the land returned back to inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called le , new dimension 
this is a independent territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is very good example , a country that can make a difference to think about how to fix it , and the relationship between people . 
and i think for ever in the world , some remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent the human imagination branch that can go back to the origin of the ancient times for all of us , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world to a part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and do things , which is that we don &apos;t make politicians . 
we think . debate is not to convince people , but we think about it in the world can to get so we can change the world &apos;s at the institutions of the month our website click about energy to three thousands of five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we see digital images from the internet . use pick the picture of static , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and it can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
we see here is so many many gb 千兆 byte . level of digital photograph , they can continue to do and smooth can zoom in , by the way mapping through , and they can do to rearrange them . 
they can see how many images of data , how big the and image how big , all with seadragon have this ability . 
so the image of you are a digital camera picture taken , but this one is , it &apos;s a different from the library of congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it and no difference , because it limited system , the only thing is , you use the screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s not the data images . 
this is what the dickens had 荒凉 山庄 , &quot; is chapter three content . 
i give you that this is a really not text and images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture of 张大 opening . 
and in the paper version or the itself contains proportion of the images in reading , when people get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in this a &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture . this is just -- you see the normal advertising to high resolution , in a lot of extra images into the content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to actually use of the screen is limited . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and the kind of information . 
obviously , this technology for use digital maps , and it &apos;s one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make a difference in their own . 
these are just the nasa geographic images in space . 
to 叠加 process and get the map of the road . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go about their experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually by two different : the technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from the university of washington graduate noah snavely can do with computer vision research . this research and get washington steve seitz university . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
in this project on the internet we &apos;ve got , it &apos;s based on building seadragon technology . 
you can see , we have access to multiple ways to look at pictures of , and to do the images subtlety 剖析 and how to have resolution experience . 
but , in these images of three . in fact , is very meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure if we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of than this space and strong sense . 
because when we make the site , to take care of problems to law . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by 串联 up in space . 
and then , we can easily , so the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this , is to really be happy . 
i think you can see the these images from a lot of different camera phone camera , from one to the professional . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment was put together . 
let me to find some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors 大头 contains the pictures , etc . 
i remember that we should have a series of photos -- ah , in here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to see in the poster to rebuild the environment . 
here &apos;s the point is that we can work to use the internet community . we can from there to get everybody . everybody environment for different memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , what a lot more than just to collect all up . 
this is a model , however , is the earth . 
this is like stephen lawler , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people to use and complex , and it becomes more valuable . 
user picture , you will be the 注 tag . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software that really means is to explore . 
it &apos;s in building a picture of the links . 
this 接合 process . it &apos;s based on the content . 
more exciting is that contains a picture of text semantic information . 
for example , what you &apos;re in the picture , and the key word , page would have a lot of text and images of the relevant information . 
now , that all these pictures and images to you , that would be like ? 
then , so these semantic information to each other and to link in is a big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in the time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about this book of hope it . and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to from a recognized principles of about it . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 笃信 疑 principles . 
well , that this is to say , if we want to get people to get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is this thing in the freedom to is good , valuable , for what they need to . 
and once you have the freedom , all of us can 做主 with all their way to get on the big benefits , people i don &apos;t have to 做主 for them . 
freedom to make a lot of the way it is on the largest increase selective . 
people more choices , it &apos;s more freedom , freedom , get more and more that benefits . 
i think , like this idea that 掺 into the water that age-old in that nobody wanted to get it up to ask questions . 
this is the same idea deep embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples look at the social progress . let &apos;s be possible to do something . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
i just want to say the ingredients and salad . 
you see , this is like supermarkets . 
and you turn out to be a one to store it a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for cd machine , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s the one in a three-dimensional sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
in the components of this , you can have last 650万种 out of the things pop-up sound system . 
you can &apos;t don &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a little of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid , you want to refer to was telephone service , which have to go to the bell , just a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , it is that the dead are not to be bad . 
that are 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially mobile . now , it is . 
these are the phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 -- that will take mp three the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t in the next to your store seen it , don &apos;t worry , with no . how do you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people went to the store , and you ask : is there a not so much with function ? &quot; 
you want to answer is , what ? 
answer is no ” “ . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a not so many things to do the phones . 
the same in life , in some other than shopping for things that we have more impact on the same choice , this up there . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , they tell you how to do so again , this time . 
instead , you to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth and nail . a very risk . 
for a very 乙 and so forth and risk to treat . you do ? 
and you say , “ doctor , i should do ” how ? 
they said , again , a very nail these and risk , there are very 乙 and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , “ , but i don &apos;t you ” is . 
now the prescription , all over the ad is for you , these people with me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said . if we can &apos;t think a can &apos;t go to buy 柜台 . 
why should we do have to market ? 
answer is , they want to look at the advertising , and the next morning going to call your doctor , to put on the prescription drugs put into them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the subject to the . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now our gender , not from my parents down there inherited , but to invented by themselves . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to to you about today , you want to do a what people and the men and women -- is the make decisions . 
in marriage of in the family , everybody in the age that it &apos;s almost got married , of course , and that &apos;s 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing that you need to and who &apos;s married , and it &apos;s not what i was , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and now , all the things that can take to pick 拣 挑拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart good student , but now i give them all placed homework time less than one of the fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they than ever before -- and the students stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask yourself : i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t married ? is going to now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they do is i don &apos;t do all placed homework , whether they also in my class . take a grades . 
they really should go to the problem , because this is something important question . 
now , do work like karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day , any time in the earth a work in the corner -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place to wireless online , but i don &apos;t tell you in god . 
don &apos;t tell you is the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible freedom of choice for us is we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , for their work now that &apos;s right , and the rest . 
we look at the kid play football , in a 裤兜 with the phone , another 裤兜 it in with their blackberry blackberry . so , and it goes on the laptop . 
even though they are locked up , we are looking at in 场上 rivals for children and constantly ask ourselves , so this is not the phone ? 
go back to the email or not ? i don &apos;t have to write this an 信稿 ? 
even if you give their answer is no , you have children . &quot; and the experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether thing was , the small things matter and live in a way , is to life . 
we live in the world is this . 
that is , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today , we live in the world is this . 
the question is , what &apos;s a good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know it &apos;s good . so let me say it is a bad . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
one , some say up an oxymoron , is to give us , and -- that &apos;s not free , but inside , is paralysis . 
so many people have the choice to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you give you a very vivid example to do that , this is a about pension plan for investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to the vanguard investment . vanguard record is a big foundation , a company has about a million people , and two 000多个 office place . 
her research , that &apos;s when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 fund 10 percent , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 foundation to choose to choose to decide that it &apos;s just so you can actually even more difficult in last tomorrow . 
get tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to the year of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , to have the possibility of is rigid and paralysis . 
it makes us into this world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make the right , right ? 
there you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation is wrong , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the more puzzling for something , to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make choices . 
secondly , economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert about a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we use to compare that to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice to think , is very easy to imagine that you give up to attract people in that . it makes you always right . you see the think 美中不足 . 
for example , that -- and it , but if you are not people , new york , i have a 歉 . 
but this is that you should think right now . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
all of the beach , 明媚 , they have it . 
you can better than that ? that &apos;s it like this in “ huh , really , it &apos;s bad ” “ in august , ” . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home , ” 
“ i want to go back to the car stop in my own front . ” . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost to all of the parking , opportunity . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let us have decided to make it with this actually even to a 英明 . 
we have the option more choices to people in these things that the more , and all these things into the opportunity cost . 
it &apos;s an example . 
this cartoon means for the problem . 
it also say the “ live in the ” this idea . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , and a sense is , when you chose to do something , and that you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing is to have a lot of your place , and you &apos;re going to undermine do appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
the point in time , i have to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is a pattern that , you buy , not right back pants , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time , enough to wash over a million times , pants to become 凑合 . 
so , in many years old and the pants , i finally 上街 to buy a new . i said , “ feed , i want to a jeans , this is the size of the ” i . 
and they said , you have to 紧身 , comfort , , or 宽松 , ? 
the first to 扣子 and the locked ? 石磨 and , the wash ? 
to a kind of fast them ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw , almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i asked , “ i &apos;m going to that used to be the only kind of ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , i can take a me the most 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not have to really wrong . these choices that i have to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? for this , and i specifically wrote a book for me to make excuses . 
and i felt worse reason is , because there &apos;s so much as i can choose , for a jeans what should have much good to be a good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is a , so much , i didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the best is at least have a 极致 perfect . 
it &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i take i had to and i want to do , and i expect more than it is , it &apos;s become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together , in addition to improve people what to do , you know , how good expectations and no other people how to do that . 
that &apos;s just to make people and less happy , even though that it &apos;s good . 
to the people that people don &apos;t understand this . because if they had people in the , you know , you don &apos;t have to know what this is the idea . i mean it . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in all things are bad past all better than now . 
and the reason why is that when one of the things are not good , how people might experience to some surprises . 
now we , in these rich , industrial civic life in the world , perfect . it &apos;s of course , for every one of the things you only want it worse than you would expect . 
you will not be what you know what , because i than my high expectations and . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
now , i think -- and you talk about ourselves a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a very good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now in the store , there &apos;s hundreds of jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can do it better . 
there with hundreds of out the jeans , you don &apos;t put things excuse f it up . 
and it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be very good , and they are to -- and to feel down , to blame myself . 
in the past of our generation , and the industrialized world -- if the developed world clinical , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
i remind you . 
the choice , happiness , and that -- well , the standard , we all think is right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
of course , there &apos;s choose not to better than choice , but not just to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a key , , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond ‘ choice we rich and ’ needs , the key . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that have so many choices , is a matter of rich . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least we heard a few of those problems , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about is the modern western societies on a particular question . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we produce the expensive and it &apos;s the car seats babies 于事无补 , just in waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , these expensive , complex choice is not just 于事无补 . 
they actually give us harm . 
they actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and fix it . 
products redistribution will make all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our another . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in this fish is all in all the ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , what is this . 
but i think , the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not free , and it &apos;s really fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is , paralyzed by is satisfied . 
everyone needs a fish that “ ” . 
in this fish -- and there , for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s a symbolic fish that is going to suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
we have this from a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new design in biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists are in a different level to try to understand the problem . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to go to the . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , from biology , it was the computer and entered the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , we could build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a map of microbes sequence , mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome in the lab to make it replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we can find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 genes from the 一百组 separate out is that we can see here . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study is synthetic chromosomes , so that we can change it to continue to questions of the most fundamental problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never make a big molecule ? 
and , if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way , is not the only some live as chemicals . 
we digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it was in increasing . and what we &apos;re going to put speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact , it took me through the stages . we do in the first trial ago , i have a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it &apos;s synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world in a 十几万台 device make little pieces of dna , in 30 to 50 character , and this is a process of decline , made the long time , that &apos;s much more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to put these small snippet emissions and put together all wrong . 
this is our first try , from phi x 174 bacteriophage genome -- and the first digital information . 
it &apos;s a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it &apos;s wrong , have a symbol of 5,000 of dna . 
and the most exciting . when we put this video is not a live sexual chemicals bacteria , put into the bacteria started reading the genetic code , make virus particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli and 兰氏 革 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , i think they model to understand this very well . 
he was laughing more than you go . 
so what we think this is actually in software to build a biological system in their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you start in the computer use digital information . that these numbers to be very accurate information . 
when we first in 1995 , to this group , gene sequencing , right is the standard every 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , in sequence is wrong , on average , 30 . if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design part of the design work is 50 character and the length of time and other 50 character long piece 叠加 to build smaller units of the time . we have to design , they can come together . 
and we have a design of the unique . 
you may have heard in one of us to 水印 . 
think about gene code . there are four : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 -- the body and the character 编成 about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , we can do is to use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed . we didn &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we made these images from enzyme and can use to cut 裁 . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , from 7000 character , which they started to piece together to make people 24 , ask the length of time to time and 几组 merger , 72 into a long time , people . 
in every stage , we grow a piece of these , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process in a minute , you will see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece , over 100 people in their basic , it &apos;s hard to keep in e. coil in a long , long . try to do in the modern molecular biologist in all the tools we turn to other ways . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , it can put together to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example of that is a little radiation 球菌 able to afford the energy 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images , the chromosomes , nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s going to ourselves , before the combination of the back . 
we have this can have 千种 . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has show a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a we take this molecule microscopic images through this process . it &apos;s all about the yeast , and the way we design and put it in the right pieces . yeast automatically will they aggregates . 
this is not an image microscopic ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
these are , long about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than 580000 character long genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we find in 10号 distance , not to print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously a very simple process virus with a bacteria is more complex . 
we do something like this is a relatively simple biology , and you can take a into the nucleus , and the other cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but we also recently clear . we can do a whole transplant cells from the chromosome from one to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we &apos;re trying to design this process into some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that for a second of all species or from other parts of the third side , in a second 数千种 features to add a new its own . 
that can take the people in the process of evolution , and just have a genetic change ignore the idea of a life of reality . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzyme dna is to digest . 
what of the cells of no this enzyme and no this enzyme when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is at a material , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a has a new dna . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original of all species we disappeared , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins are changed , and the membrane change -- when we reading the genetic code , in fact , is we put into it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we really can shift to dramatically , through dna to change things . 
now , i want to say it &apos;s not the -- this century is based on the 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of life is based on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think , for some reason we need to do is very clear . 
our population will in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world &apos;s people into three relatively in every one of us from 1946 , is the people in the next 40 years , and within a four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 food for people , clean fresh water , the fuel all , the very difficult . 
change to nine billion people that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil . it &apos;s 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about the biological process or any can replace it program , it &apos;s a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that the material that was in the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world that had a contains about 两千万组 genetic database , and i just love them as the design components . 
electric industry only 10 to a components that , let &apos;s get diversity . 
now , the limits of from reality in biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology is that , because we can make a group called “ chromosomes ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a day chromosome . 
and this is just standard . we can choose to survive , to choose to chemical production , or fuel , they produce , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit down , really work in the computer to design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what their genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you see the recent corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it was sugar , into a high value of the fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
and one of the co2 is a way -- 
so -- so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a , was in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep . about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
and if we look to collect their of these two , very convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we may increase in life ? &quot; &quot; what is the understanding of basic question . 
we really have replace the oil industry 化工 little goal . and -- now , if you can &apos;t do that in ted , where there are probably ? as a major energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tool making a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see this all happened flu , we always to slow the time of year , and in this case , they really useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is the future might present situation with change , we evolved as a synthetic tree , bacteria , 古物 species is really the nuclear and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , it can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 ted u short of the presentation , brian cox shares some which super 对撞机 news , including . it &apos;s now doing the repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to it . it is the machine . 
this is it , if you don &apos;t to last year , the lhc . is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state , every second 6亿次 and make it a state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in the mechanical 日内瓦 . 
we use it to the big bang little some camera 
this is that , i worked at this atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this one . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters of particles and the way around , the lhc . we have to plan with the lhc . part of a lot of particles , in that 辐 go flying off . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know is this got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people to see this graph is google front page . 
this suggests that we work with a shock to culture that it &apos;s science as a shock . 
but about a week later , we machine out of the break , with these 导线 about -- the golden 导线 . 
these 导线 transmission 安培 when they current machine on . 
now some of you might say engineers “ impossible wire , these little ” too . 
they can do , because when it &apos;s very low them into the superconducting 导线 . 
so in minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between the temperature of the cases these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in of a 接点 have put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise , it is a little bit to transmission of 安培 and they and their resistance 
this is . 
very shocking , because the magnets up to 20 tons . they move about a ruler miles . 
there are about 50 magnet . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to start it , and in six july , to get the data , and then continue our mission to find out of the most basic units . 
now , one very clear these accident 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering argument , but these very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still my for the itself , and that &apos;s the value in the lhc . 
thank you . 
elizabeth gilbert 呵护 . about creativity and make them light . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love with the with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love with the with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love with the with life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a special event , however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a special things that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
and it turns out , and no matter where people are , i think this is my life . this is the result , no matter where i now to , people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , play 完了 . 
they &apos;re very to come up with , and i said , “ . you don &apos;t you ? no . this is not in my life beyond the book ? ” . 
it &apos;s really going to comfort people ! 
i was in the same question is , people said , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you &apos;re afraid of going to continue to collapse , you say ? 
you end up is in the dream of die of despair , in failed 苦痛 and i was always get to that question . 
and the question , the simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that i was afraid to think a lot of people don &apos;t . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , the fear of writing , i &apos;ve been to recently , why would i fear of writing ? but , the fear of writing , i &apos;ve been to recently , why would i fear of writing ? 
this is the idea is a rational ? 
people fear destined in your work ? it logical fear ? people in their own destiny of logical ? it work ? 
no one said , “ john , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ? ” . 
never would happen this question . 
of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer a group that doesn &apos;t in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of a century of creative genius , the great 英年早逝 examples are just look at the early years of a century of creative genius , the great 英年早逝 are often the case is age lightly died since . 
even if the suicide , no , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent , not even if the suicide , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent . 
and the 曼梅 le , died in front of the last one interview i said , “ every one of the book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
for your work life , this is how radical statement . 
i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
you think this is a view ? no problem , even from a little bit further look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even from a little bit further look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 
this is terrible , and not only 可憎 , i don &apos;t want this idea of goes to the next century . 
this is terrible , and not only 可憎 , i don &apos;t want this idea of goes down a century to this point , not only 可憎 terrible , and , i don &apos;t want this idea of goes to the next century . 
i think we creative genius great encourage them to live to be more . 
and i , myself , believed that it will i in the dark 绝境 and i , myself , believed that it will i in the dark 绝境 , especially in my career , especially now stage is now in my career . 
you see , i was young , i have to 40 years old , you see , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years of life . 
and frankly , look at all , we talk about that long , i would say , is the heart of friends , and it really possible , i &apos;ve ever is this the great success is over . 
oh my god , what this is the idea . 
is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano . don &apos;t understand the way , is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank way to the piano . no . i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
and deep thinking about it , in my view , you want to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protection . 
i have to , in a way to build a safe distance , the difference between writing , and i work for responses extreme anxious , the difference between writing , and i work for responses extreme anxiety . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because the around us to go back to the problem . 
in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human . 
people believe , is to create a sacred elves from distant and not to know where all the artists , with a remote and you know from distant purpose and not to know where all the artists , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks universal to call this a with creativity to for the djinn “ 守护神 ” 
and for people to think socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 from a distance , what he was common wisdom people to think socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 , give him from a distance . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ genius ” ancient rome that people have similar , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this is a good idea , because i don &apos;t think people “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particular individual 聪慧 . 
this is a view , this is what i was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people 成败 from work on protecting mechanism . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
ancient artist by this idea , and get to protect the narcissism artists of ancient by this point and get to protect , excessive narcissism . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of genius “ ” help work done . 
if you work , so it &apos;s also not all of you . 
we all know that &apos;s because you “ ” very bad genius . 
this is in the western for a long time about creativity . 
and i want to say is , i think that &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow , that the sun for vulnerable individual , , is too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of our self , and for people to make most of it . they completely straight up twisted , one of our self , and for people to make an incredibly expect . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of kill artist is i think this pressure , in the last 500 years of the artist . 
if it &apos;s at least i think that this is that our question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to older , they used to reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to older , they used to reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk 抹杀 18 minutes , the development of the human mind 500多年 reason we can &apos;t use a short talk 抹杀 18 minutes , the development of the human mind 500多年 rational . 
maybe , i can convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any was trying to make people believe that there are ways you had this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a 雷鸣 of the mall in her and the really . 
she can feel it , because this is a force that she would 撼动 feet into the ground . 
she can feel it , because this is a force that she would 撼动 feet into the ground . 
and now , she can do the only thing with her , say , is to “ 死命 狂奔 ” 
in other , and this is called me the most amazing part , in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail to pull it 顺势 back , the other hand , to the poetry 誊写 on paper 顺势 and put it back , the other hand , to the poetry 誊写 on paper . 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on the order of just &apos;s upside down , from the beginning , the last word go by , and , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s incredible , and my creative process . it &apos;s not exactly the same of course i do the whole process , i &apos;m not a pipe , my work is more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 , and as i have to get an incredible inspiration , but even 古板 , and as i have to get an incredible . 
there may have a lot of people like . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i will meet and to the idea of where you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i don &apos;t know where to go through and inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it , don &apos;t mind would loss ? we want to see how it , don &apos;t mind going missing ? 
he was going to capture it , but no way , he neither pen and paper , no tape , he was trying to capture it , but no way , he neither pen and paper , no tape 
“ i had no , i can &apos;t do ” 
suddenly , he &apos;s a weird to stop the to panic and impatience emotions , and do something unusual . 
suddenly , he &apos;s a weird to stop the to panic and impatience emotions , and did an unusual thing , he suddenly a weird to stop the to panic and impatience emotions , and do something unusual . 
he looks at the sky , to look up to it said , “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , i was driving ? ” him to look up at the sky , and it said , “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , i was driving ? ” ? 
he looks at the sky , to look up to it said , “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , i was driving ? ” i looked like can immediately the next piece that look like ? 
if you really want to pick out in the world , and a great time to come in , i could , if you really want to pick out in the world , and a great time to , again , i was in . 
or , you can today , to get people to harassed 莱昂纳德 de 科恩 to 
or , you can today , to get people to harassed 莱昂纳德 de 科恩 to 
since that event later , tom &apos;s change the creative process . 
it &apos;s not work , he &apos;s still the dark , we &apos;re still onto something . 
for inspiration can is his and it &apos;s a unknown in between the weird , wonderful and strange relationship can is his for inspiration and it &apos;s a unknown in between the weird , wonderful relationship , and that &apos;s a way beyond ourselves . 
this story 潜移默化 to change the way my work , it &apos;s a transformation has saved me this story again 潜移默化 to change the way my work , this one has saved my time . 
not only , and it &apos;s completely shit , i started to think i should give up to write this book . 
not only , and it &apos;s completely shit , i started to think i should give up to write this book . 
and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 thing , and i tried to try and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 thing , and i tried to . 
i looked up from manuscripts of the room , to one of the manuscript . and i looked up to the room , in a corner . 
“ because you can see , i &apos;ve shot for the committed no kept ” “ because you can see , i &apos;ve shot for the committed ” . no . 
“ if you want this book better , and turn them to you , do you work ” that part . 
if you don &apos;t “ to help , that you can see the ” to . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because this is my job . &quot; 
today , i hope that the historical record : i 尽责 to 坚守 my jobs € today i want to record that : i 坚守 尽责 to me . 
that &apos;s wonderful performance , because they are great professional dancer who show a wonderful , because they are great professional dancer . 
occasionally , although very unlikely , but actually happen one a dancer going beyond the 出世 transcendent experience when . 
you know , i should say this is because you have in a moment , have seen that . 
time to stop , like a dancer , the time seemed to stop , across the dancer like he did . and before the performance 1000场 and no difference , but everything , it was miraculous unity . 
刹那间 , he is not a normal human , his life , from the bottom , light from the inside . 
刹那间 , he is not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was sacred shine . 
now , clearly people know what it is , they can make it was called the name of the people , to know exactly what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some incredible for the magic , people will 喝彩 : “ -- oh , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 , oh , great -- really , really great , an incredible ” that is good , there emerge . 
this is a good way , because this is what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky , is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up for the most tricky for artists , is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on that tuesday morning was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
and just the legs , when bad old you are going to the people , maybe , and he couldn &apos;t be that the last night . 
maybe never somebody dance , in his 喝彩 god with his good , there should be , how are they ? 
this is a very tough question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
this is a very hard problem , and the creative process of cognitive one of the pain of this is a very tough question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
but maybe we were all suffering , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your jobs , and on you . what is : if you &apos;re dancer , that &apos;s dancing . 
坚守 in your jobs , and on you . what is : if you &apos;re dancer , that &apos;s dancing . 
if not , it just continue to dance , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 . 
if not , it just continue to dance , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 . 
i believe we have to teach this one . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
欧 嘞 . 
in 2009 , al gore on ted showed the world &apos;s new is that trend , climate scientists , more than a to worry about that , and he for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore recently trend for the climate . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about the polar ice cap . in the last 三百万年 in the area of the equivalent of the american south 48 state is 缩减 a 40 percent . 
but it can that not all of this problem . no , because it means that the ice cap thickness . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the global climate system in the heart . 
in winter , the heart 舒张 summer . 
i &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 . 
red is 冻 permanent ice . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue is a year in the winter of ice in summer 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five years or more time , you see the ice , it &apos;s like blood to move to 各部 &apos;s body . 
in 25 years of the time , it , from here to here . 
that &apos;s worth the greenhouse effect that around the arctic ocean 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon and 解冻 干冰 . when compost methane , carbon microbes . 
if a breakthrough the greenhouse gas emissions , to the atmosphere is the amount of global warming pollution . 
in alaska light in some of the lake has can see the water 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
wow . 
she &apos;s ok , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , north sink of heat , which the heat . 
this is a year of melting . 
but it has to be than traffic 往年 . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq greenland . 
if you want to understand the land of melting ice how to make sea level rise here is 入海口 it . 
here &apos;s the traffic in 急速 . 
antarctica , the other end of this planet of the ice . 
last month , the entire continent report , scientists are in decline of the ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
this is in the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the water from the financial get half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , this is the ice , the city drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in terms of water , it &apos;s a . 
and as you see is , we &apos;re very serious . 
the world . and dry in the fire in numbers . 
and the world population in time is absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years , 总数 in time to the first four times more 七十五年 总数 . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we increase day 七千万吨 co2 emissions from the ocean 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
look at the pacific region east to west from america in india , the 两边 含氧量 in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of the big reasons , except forest destruction 20 percent of the oil is burning . 
oil , coal most urgent very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution is to build a more carbon use of the planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s some have recently discovered the and some new green alternative . 
but now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political . 
carbon and oil and coal industries in last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what i remembered . 
before and after christmas , my home in tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
can you see in the news . 
here , is the second big were put up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a this coal industries of carbon . 
coal is cool , happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile productive and how he helped us economic development . 
coal cool day in , it becomes more clean 
he cute , sanctuary workers work for that . 
this is west virginia , a lot of coal waste 产地 . 
the big is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore . and now is one of the president of the project to two . 
this is one , a part of it . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal for explaining coal and truth . 
in fact , coal and not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , don &apos;t for global warming and . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plants . 
some spectacular machine 喧哗 . 
but this is technology clean coal . 
and burning coal is causing global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look at it . this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , the national security , climate crisis 
these are going to be the strings of us together is based on carbon for oil products on are like the man imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve the problem of projects . 
repower america with 100 percent clean electricity in 10 years . 
for the new work we get people to live more safe , and not for the earth in warming . 
and finally , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
and finally a 
this is about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to the less dependent on the way . 
the future is in here . wind and solar energy , new network . 
new investment to create a huge job . 
repower america &apos;s wishes come true . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables you would think -- a toy . 
first of all , i want you to remember you in a time of being a kid play a kit . 
when you idea how to build with legos to do this , and it , is you &apos;re learning how to think about and solve the problem . this is something that is to 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that really helps us to 空间结构 around learning a lot of things . 
so the question would be , and in my mind , so we decided to get the answer , so that will have this siftables . 
simply said , siftable . it &apos;s a computer , as a small cookie big . 
siftables can hands just move 每块 siftable each other , can perceive each other , and move 每块 siftable displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like the block , can have with . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that the digital information tools . 
the tools , with more and more sensitive to each other , feel , feel any with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this siftable have 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows images in here , and maybe if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe that image to maybe the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you take them out a 挨 a good , interesting phenomenon will happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves , and maybe each other . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use and interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that down to from a different color siftable into a siftable . 
we look at the demo , there &apos;s three dollars a barrel of with paint patterns siftables , we can put these barrel into the color of the color of that , to study together . 
if it , and how it can go back a few . 
siftables and learning machine function , can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , more quickly see it . 
this is i &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- and this is working . i do with a simple equation of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
this &quot; play games together in a way as the , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter 几块 siftables together to make words , siftables in the dictionary automatically find the words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell it turns out that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here &apos;s some kids are in the media in siftables ; in the test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
kids love siftables . 
and interestingly , in this game play together words , we don &apos;t need to explain what they . 
just to tell them , this is a word “ together ” game , they know what to do . 
now on the screen that is other people in siftables experience . 
the bottom right corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now on the screen that is a function of to interact with it . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
and this is the child felix . 
he can put some new add elements to animation image , he can do is to the table siftables pick up to it should be images that image , you can put these new add to the elements animation . 
see , he put the sun add up . 
the sun it up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
the orange one tractors . 
do good . 
and to shake siftables animation images that can make new element . he put into the new elements to add up -- the dog 吠 . 
he &apos;s in writing in his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he was plan out plot how stories . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function and 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables that function in terms of sound , can make like 超载 . and bess and drum sound . 
and there &apos;s tiles 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into the siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to come to sound editors module . 
there &apos;s this 响器 , which is a voice , the siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles come close to sound can adjust the sound . 
so , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume siftable near the tiles tiles siftable to change the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at . 
to take the two tiles 超载 into edit , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now , in some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to come to sound filter tiles drums , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to develop some rhythm , just to block the rhythm to module . 
now to put sound to filter tiles shellfish tiles . the filter . 
music playing in the process , and to 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s playing , over time , you can play a short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so . thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you the siftable , we &apos;re in the next research lab to . 
i want to talk to you the idea is we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect together and you talk about .
