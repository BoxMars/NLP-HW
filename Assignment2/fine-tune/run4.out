for a rapture . and the story , a national geographic the explorers by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , the culture is an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same kind of adaptive . 
we are all born into 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 , so we need to sing and dance in 排遣 life that we create 苦楚 art . 
but you can see that every culture song and dance rhythm rhythm , has unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send a different way to make you see . 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture conflicts in life , and the internet cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity , it &apos;s a very strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
in biosphere by severe around in circles like also facing the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
and one of the most important is that language . 
in our lives on this planet , that &apos;s 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is shining human spirit . 
it &apos;s actually in a unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a mind a conscious and a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know that the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we in the same number of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
the language has no 传人 that unless we work , and it will be completely gone . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re a final say 本族语 . people can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our children are not allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks , you have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore the race and to give you a rough race and understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
it &apos;s a lot of people have forgot . i said “ different way of ” . i said “ ” different ways . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 played methuselah -- the areas that they &apos;re called the 蚺 race , because they believe in a time , they come from the 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 forest , and so , in their mind 天穹 with the forest canopy . no . 
they say , with a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that as a 通婚 异族 went to the people with a different languages , married . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language , you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
when i was exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 to one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i was , and they had to peace . 
five year 1957 man to try to them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they have in the next eight to 10 十张 they himself picture , and we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think that live in 雨林中 people have never seen this two-dimensional . 
from the forest , they pick up these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people , and the person , but nothing , and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 this missionary five died . 
and it &apos;s not only 华拉尼 戮 at people . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of the population was their 戮 to die . 
we &apos;re going to 一个八代 宗谱 survey found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the more 年迈 out what to do is going to wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , to the forest , they have astonishing 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell predator 40 step , animals smell urine several hundred yards away , and they know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
born in the soul . 
the dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 below the soul to just replace the soul of life in the short time for the shining 侍僧成 . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re cathedral to dance . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
and i had access to all of those groups in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 科基人 of the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient civilization tyranny of descent , they were once conquered and take over the columbia the coast in plain 此后 they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent that has never been in the spaniards . 
and to their 续 today in the monk to rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain these values , and with the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s a beautiful , you want to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 弟兄 call to say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain shelter , or god is a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s a symbol that means that the people &apos;s relationship with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia , up by the people on the mind , i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll see that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll see them different way of life 
this is a picture i in august in the northwest amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent spirit and plants 萨满教 徒 often used it did die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain with five 羟 color is very close to 成份 . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribe , people are from a five -- 羟 color is plants extract the nose , and it took crack . 
if you use a sucked into the powder , you &apos;ll see these 光怪陆离 in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distort it were totally wiped out 
but the color is matter that doesn &apos;t oral because they &apos;re going to be one of your body , called a single is 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral the color is matter , there is going to change and oral 氧化酶 living as any chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that the 藤本植物 there -- β 咔 啉 is going to be able to control the 氧化酶 and play is the potency of color , so you have to ask ourselves 不由得 
when we do all kinds of experiments , and make mistakes and measure . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes of the people that died in the cane is all of them in the deep jungle in that we think they &apos;re different . 
if you ask , how are they gave these plants hierarchy , they said , &quot; i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , and i said , don &apos;t know . 
and i tell you they say , if the months circle of the things that night in the plant , every plant to use the different little , singing to you . 
it &apos;s not that you get a ph.d. from harvard , but it &apos;s much more 报表 calculus is more fun . 
now . we have this question , and some of us with the aboriginal people had thought they 离群索居 丰富多彩 life , but as we the people in moving forward and back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been a new way of life as a strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is the great sioux nation and the people who say goodbye 骑马 and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat race loop 完整性 is not change or technological innovation , it &apos;s the power of all the words , he &apos;s robust . 
we take of tibet recently , where i do a lot of research , where you can see the political repressive brutal . 
and genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide . it &apos;s cultural destruction people lifestyle 行径 no opinion is , in many places it even be a part of this strategy is . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese people immediately , he was killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family 成份 and be 关押 . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding dress and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and be into 学习班 . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the face of hair 臂章 and be in a country of seven 劳教 guilty . 
the pain of tibet for people to take the human salvation to get to see . 
and finally , we &apos;re going to have a choice is that we want to live in a world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
we have to think , in the world is in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 revolution in agriculture , human time to time , we seed , he went to the girl 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra for 祭 for us to create the level of 社会分工 . it &apos;s 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society and nearly 三百年 . 
and i think this brief history was enough to make that we have to have the ability to solve the challenges . 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 a different . 
in a song of that , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that every race , and all of those organisms 昌盛 for life . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the top . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people tell me about a legacy of about his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make the 定居点 away by them . 
this is the old man to move . 
his family that he &apos;s safe to put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you know , inuit people fear them cold , it &apos;s god , it alone . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he &apos;s slept outside wearing his seal 长裤 , he took a stool in hand when stool quickly become stiff , he made it into a blades . 
and in this shit , to make a 口水 on the edge of the blades , and it &apos;s frozen and become very robust and he used it to a dog 刀子 宰杀 . 
the 剥 dogs bark into a 挽具 he and his dog made out of a dog sleds to another -- and that when you don &apos;t put it in a shit ice sheet . 
this is really a 空手 life . 
in many ways . this is the inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
1999 four months , the government to a area than in california , and the area of the land and 之和 returned back to the inuit people . 
i was the new home , it &apos;s called dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is good , a country that can make a difference to think about how to fix it , and the relationship between the people . 
and i think for ever in the world , some remote people is not remote . 
because there &apos;s a 族类 home . 
they are the branches of human imagination , you can go back to the millions of times , for all of us , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and tv can do is we believe that politicians do not . 
we think . argument is not to convince people , but we think about it , and you can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s at about the institutions of the website and a click of thousands of about three to five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have a million people . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we see digital images from the internet , to pick out a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and you can go all around them . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is many many gb and byte 千兆 . level of digital photographs , and they can do for smooth , and you can zoom in , by the way mapping through them , and we can do to rearrange them . 
no matter how data can see , there &apos;s a lot of pictures and images themselves , how much seadragon all have this ability to do . 
so most of you are a digital camera picture taken , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it , and there &apos;s no difference , because it limited system , the only thing is , you can use the like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very , very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , the data is an image . 
this is what he dickens &quot; 荒凉 山庄 line , &quot; is chapter of content . 
i gave you prove that this is really text and the images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s a read the book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 is a picture of the opening . 
and the paper , or a magazine paper version itself contains proportion of the images , reading , people will get better reading experience , reading to enjoy it . 
here we made small change in it a &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture . this is just -- you see the ad higher resolution versions of the picture , into the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can see other version , and even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to the screen , is actually used the limit . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and this information . 
obviously , with this technology , with digital maps , of course , it &apos;s one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to do this in my whole . 
these are just a nasa space on the basis of geography . 
to 叠加 process and get the road map . 
now , let &apos;s put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually by two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from graduate school at the university of washington noah snavely are going to work with computer vision . this research and get steve seitz washington university . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got application , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to do with multiple ways of looking at , and to do with subtlety 剖析 and a lot of the resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot better than this sense of space and strong . 
because we make the site , to take care of the law . 
these are all the images from flickr , to be in that space is 串联 up . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : i mean , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this , it was to be happy . 
i think you can see that these images from the many different camera , from a cell phone camera into a single the . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment are put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
i remember here , there should be a series of photos -- well , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to rebuild , to see in the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can work to use the community . we can start to get everybody . everybody to different environments that memory , collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , have a much more than just to collect it all . 
this is a model , however , is the whole planet . 
this is stephen lawler , like , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
their images , are you 注 tag on . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand that it &apos;s right , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the years to come from the picture 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software is really , is to explore . 
it &apos;s a picture of the building hypertext . 
this 接合 . it &apos;s based on images of content . 
more exciting , and that contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you have on the web in a picture , a button on the web , and the text is going to have a lot to do with this picture of information . 
now , suppose that image with you a picture of it all together , that would be like ? 
now , so the semantic information to each other inside of links , and is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about the book of content to it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a the standard principles about it . 
well , what the standard ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 疑 笃信 principles . 
well , this is to say , if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to get people to be free to maximize . 
and it &apos;s free , with this stuff was good and valuable , for what they need to . 
and once you have the freedom , all of us can themselves with 做主 all the way , big enough to get welfare , people don &apos;t have to work for me were 做主 . 
and the freedom to do a lot to do is on the largest increase selective . 
people more choices , freedom , which are much more freedom , get the benefits that the more . 
i think , the idea is like 掺 into the water that the age-old that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples , and look at the social progress . let &apos;s be possible to do something . 
this is my house , near a supermarket . not very much . 
i just want to talk about this salad ingredients . 
you see , it &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one to store it a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s the one in a three-dimensional sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
in the store components that you can have a close 650万种 the combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a bunch of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid , you have to think was called the phone service , and that is to go to the company , and it just a . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , it &apos;s time to the dead are not bad . 
that are 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially cell phones . now , it is . 
these are the phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 -- that will take mp , the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , it doesn &apos;t take long , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store , and you ask : is there a with so many function ? &quot; 
you think , is to say ? 
answer is no “ ” . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things mobile phone . 
again , in life , the other day , more than to affect the things that we have the same , and up there . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , they tell you how to do so again , the time . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail . there are things and risk . 
and so forth . there &apos;s 乙 things and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , i should do ” how ? 
they said , again , a nail these things and risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how are you going to treat ? 
if you ask the doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you have ” that ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for you and me , and the ordinary people . if you think about it , it &apos;s said , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why should we do to the market ? 
answer is , they want to look at the advertising , and the next morning going to call your doctor , and they put on a prescription drugs on them . 
now , as we gender identity that kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide , trying to convince you of that . 
now , our gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but to invented by themselves . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you today , you &apos;re going to do a kind of the people and the men and women -- make decisions . 
in the marriage of the family , and everyone in the age , which got married , that &apos;s almost as a result , and that &apos;s 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing that you need the choices , and who are married , and not when you see , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and now , about everything that can take to pick 拣 挑拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart good student , but now i give them all placed assignment less than five , one of the time . 
it &apos;s not because they than ever before -- and the students , stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not and who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re thinking , are filled with all sorts of things , are always asking myself , i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? is it going right now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
this is a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do i all placed homework , whether they , in my class . take a grades . 
they really should go to the problem , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day of any time , in any one of the work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but this restaurant , in fact , there &apos;s a place to wifi , but i don &apos;t tell you are . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i wanted to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible freedom to bring us is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , for their work now that &apos;s right , and the rest . 
we go to the kid play football , in a 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 it in with their blackberry and -- blackberry , knee and with the laptops . 
even though they &apos;re off , we are looking at children in 场上 rivals for , and continue to ask myself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to the email or not ? i don &apos;t have to write this an 信稿 ? 
if you give their answer is no , you have children . &quot; it was the experience , it &apos;s also a 打折扣 . 
look around , whatever . it &apos;s a small thing , matter and lifestyle part , life is a choice . 
we live in the world like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world , like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say that it is a bad . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
one , it &apos;s some paradox , which is , so -- to bring us is not liberating , but inside , is paralysis . 
so many people have the choice to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid examples of this , this is a about pension plan for investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to the vanguard of investment . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office places . 
her research that &apos;s when the client , and they want to give a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 foundation , down 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose , choose to decide that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
get tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , we will never come . 
not to wait for this project , they make a lot of things about 5千元 employer 对等 from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , the more likely to have the results were numb rigid . 
it makes the world into this slide , and it looks like that . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision , right , right ? 
there you really don &apos;t want to have a foundation , or is it salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the more likely to puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make decisions . 
secondly , economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice can think about it , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you give up the choice of interesting ways . and that makes you always chosen to you that think 美中不足 . 
for example , and it &apos;s -- that , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is right now , you should think about that . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
all of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
it can be better than that ? it &apos;s now are going to “ huh , really , it &apos;s bad ” “ in august , ” . 
so the “ neighbors are not ” at home . 
i &apos;m going to “ is back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was such an idea torture and 念叨 lost in every day of the parking , to the best chance . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let us to have to make a decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in that it &apos;s more , and all these things in the opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for . 
it also say the “ live in the sense that the ” . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , in a sense is , if you had to do something , and that , you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing is to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and third , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time , i went to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you get it to a time , enough times , then washed pants to become 凑合 . 
so , in the many years old pants , i finally 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is the size of the ” me . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , and they are 宽松 ? 
the first to 扣子 and the locked ? 石磨 and with this ? 
a kind of come to them ? 
and the mouth , and the back of ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw , almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i said , i &apos;m going to “ that was the only ” kind of pattern . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i have to do better . 
but there it was even worse . 
why ? for this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is because there are so many sex , i can do for a jeans what should have good to be a good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i didn &apos;t expect that much . 
and when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the better at least a is 极致 perfect . 
it &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i want to do , and i expect more than it up , and it &apos;s just become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together , except for people to choose the right thing to have a lot of good what other people don &apos;t expect to have many benefits . 
that &apos;s just to make people and less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
and the people who don &apos;t know the truth . because if they know what &apos;s inside of it , you don &apos;t have to know what is this idea . i mean it . 
it &apos;s like this and in comics , in all these things are bad past , everything is better than now . 
and the reason why is that when one of the things that are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , in our these rich , industrial civic life in the world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every one of the things that you only want it worse than you would expect . 
you will never be what was amazing , because you my than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so thank you . i want to talk about ourselves a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of on the jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t make excuses that might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be very , very good , and they have to decide -- is so disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world , in the developed world . and if any , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but they don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
i remind you . 
this and bring it to the standard -- well , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
of course , a choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a key , and i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we &apos;ve got to ‘ far beyond what we need to actually ’ the critical value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that has so much choice , is a material , good . 
the world , and a lot of places , at least , we heard a few of them , where the choice was not too much . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern western societies , on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we make the expensive and it &apos;s the car seats 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , these expensive and complicated . it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us harm . 
they actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and to do it . 
products redistribution will make all , it &apos;s not just the poor , living good , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting us another . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , the fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish in all ” is impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , what &apos;s it . 
but i think , the more clearly felt this fish , you know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is , paralyzed by is satisfied . 
everyone needs this fish “ ” . 
in this fish -- and you know , for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but there &apos;s a symbolic fish , it means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i have to talk about this project , part of the human genome , and they sense , and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from the numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” , i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we have to almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , and it from a biological mimic analysis entered the world , the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to question , if we can build any life , or are we in the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , and mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 of genes that we 一百组 separate out in front of these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to research , which is the synthetic chromosomes , so we can change it to continue to questions of the fundamental problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to build this , we never make a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way down , just some not live as chemicals . 
our digital life constantly going up exponentially . . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it still increasing . and what we &apos;re going to put speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
in fact , it through a couple steps . when we did the first trial ago , i have a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it &apos;s synthetic dna is very , very difficult . 
the world &apos;s 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , made the long , long time , that &apos;s much more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to make these little snippet emissions together , and it all wrong . 
this is the first attempt to phi x 174 , from the genome and bacteriophage -- to digital information . 
it &apos;s a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character of dna . 
the most exciting stage is when we put this video there we go live chemicals into the bacteria , the bacteria started reading the genetic code , building the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill the e. coli and 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , and i think they &apos;re model to understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud , more than you . 
so we think this is actually software can , in a biological systems that build themselves in the hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that those numbers to be very accurate information . 
in 1995 , when we first gene sequencing to this group , right . every 10,000 is basically to a mistake . 
in fact , we found , in the sequence again , it &apos;s 30 mistakes . and if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of a piece of design 50 character and the other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units of the time . we need to design that they can together . 
one of the design of a unique . 
you may have heard about us to 水印 in one . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
the character of the body 三联 -- and the character 编成 about 20 amino acids , these amino acids , and there &apos;s a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and you can use to cut 裁 enzyme . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , from 7000 . the length of time to put them together make 24 , ask people , and the length of time to time 几组 merger , a long time , at people . 
in every stage , we produce a lot of the time , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very , very reliable process a minute , you &apos;ll see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece , more than 100 people to basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for a long , and try to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there are a little radiation that is able to afford 球菌 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images , the chromosomes , nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s going to your back together again before the original . 
we have 千种 can do it . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is all about the yeast . and we put it right , design pieces . yeast automatically aggregates them . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just a optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
this is a long time about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than 580000 character long genetic code . this is a human set structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface , no distance , it will print out 142页 . and you need to print the genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple , with a bacterium , which is more complex . 
as we deal with our biology , and this is a relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into other cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they &apos;re the 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we can understand , we can do a whole list of the chromosome from one cell move on to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we try to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve had a second of all species or from other parts of the chromosome , the third side , in a second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution , and it would have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes is to digest dna . 
the cells to have this enzyme enzyme without it , and when we add in a have this enzyme chromosomes . 
it was out and work out the other one is no matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a has a new dna . 
we put in gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all of the original characteristics of all species disappear , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins are changing the membrane , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , in fact , is that we put into it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we really get through dna , to move to dramatically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of a life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think , for some reason , we need to do is very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years , from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to each of us from 1946 , who is in the next 40 years , in a four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , the fuel , is very , very difficult . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil . it &apos;s 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about the biological process or any can replace it . this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that the material that was in the atmosphere of co2 emissions . 
we now from around the world , that &apos;s the one that has about 两千万组 genetic database , and i like to see them as the design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to a components , so let &apos;s get diversity . 
now , the limits of reality from biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can make that we call the mixing of “ ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day , the chromosomes . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can start to survive , to choose , or chemical production , the fuel produced and so on . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit down , really work in the computer to design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
and you see the corn ethanol is going into a bad experiment . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it was sugar , into a high value of the fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
and the co2 is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
we &apos;re looking at is able to collect the two no , really , they &apos;re very easy to get a handle on , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase the &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we did with the oil industry 化工 with the little target . and -- now , if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there are probably ? be a major energy . 
and we &apos;re using the tools to make this real-time 几组 vaccine . 
you see in this case , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species of bacteria , which is really the 古物 and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 u at ted , in short , the brian cox : share some of which are the 对撞机 . what are now , to repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted , i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to it . it is the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state , every second 6亿次 and make the state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in the 日内瓦 mechanical . 
we use it for a big bang some camera detector . 
this is what i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this one . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters of particles , the lhc . along the way around , as we are planning to the lhc . and , in part of a lot of particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know is that it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when you go to google , saw that graph front page . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of the impact on top of it as a shock . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the main 导线 -- that golden 导线 . 
and they transmission 导线 安培 current when it started . 
now , some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , that &apos;s a little ” . 
they can do it , because when it &apos;s a very low , they superconducting 导线 . 
so in minus 271摄氏度 space between the temperature of the planet than the case of these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises that it is a little bit of transmission 安培 and they and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now , just wait for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , to get to data and we find out of the most basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but that &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still in my pursuit of the fact is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event , however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event that i have to rethink , and the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and if i , where people think this is the result is that life , and if i , where people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , not saved , play 完了 . 
they &apos;re very up to come to me and said , &quot; you don &apos;t “ ? no . you &apos;re afraid of this in my life is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people ! 
i was around in the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in the dream of despair is dead , in all the failed 苦痛 i was always get to that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know that . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , the fear of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear of writing ? but , the fear of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear of writing ? 
this is a better idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? 
no one said , “ john , do chemistry in bottleneck ? how ? ” .

in your life &apos;s work , this is a radical statement . 
i want to ask all of you is , you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you is , you have no dispute about that ? 
you think this idea ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断

and i , myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , and i , myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , especially in my career at stage , especially in my career so far . 
you see , i was young , i have to 40 years old , you know , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years of life . 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say is , in my heart , and it really possible , and i &apos;ve ever been the most successful . 
oh my god , this is what the idea . 
is this idea , it took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , is this idea , it took a 大清早 drank way at the piano . no . i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
and after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from the writing , and i work for responses extreme anxiety difference itself , and i started writing about response extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please bear with me , because the sound around us to go back to the problem . 
in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from a human in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from a human in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred , to the djinn , and you know , from remote place to be an artist , around with a remote and you know it , and you know , from far away to all the places where artists , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creative , to the djinn “ 守护神 ” for 
and for people to think socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 , from a distance to give him to think that general wisdom was that people socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 , he &apos;s from a distance . 
the roman people with the same ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ genius ” ancient rome people with the same ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this is a wonderful , because i don &apos;t think of genius “ ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think it &apos;s a genius “ ” 聪慧 personal . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people from work on 成败 psychological protection . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
the artist by this idea , and get to the protection of narcissism ancient artists from this view and get to protect , excessive narcissism . 
if you work great , it can &apos;t fully to the fact that you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of genius “ ” work done . 
if you work a terrible , and not all of you . 
we all know that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is in the western for a long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
and the 无异 to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , that &apos;s too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of our self , and for people to expand this was done in this completely straight up twisted , one of our self , and for people to make an incredibly expect . 
i think that &apos;s the pressure , in the last 500 years of artists to kill , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists together . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think , is this so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to the older , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to the older , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 out of the reason we don &apos;t mind with a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 out of the reason . 
maybe i can convince you that we all agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , and no one had ever tried to make people believe that there is that you &apos;ve all had this experience of the things that are going to be creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath , and really towards her . 
she could feel it , because it &apos;s a piece of energy to her 撼动 feet into the ground .

and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail to pull it 顺势 , come back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 顺势 out , put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper in just a upside down , from the beginning of the word , and go , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s incredible , and i , the creative process , of course it &apos;s not me all the creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even as i 古板 , and also happened to get an idea , but even 古板 , and also , as i &apos;m going to get an accident . 
there &apos;s a lot of people might have something like that . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i meet and to the idea of where you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i don &apos;t know where to go through and inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on here ?

since that event , tom &apos;s after the creative process . 
it doesn &apos;t work , he &apos;s still the dark , we &apos;re still onto something . 
for inspiration can is his and the outside , there &apos;s an unknown weird , wonderful between and strange relationship for inspiration can is his external unknown , and it &apos;s a weird , wonderful in between , and that &apos;s a relationship beyond ourselves . 
this story 潜移默化 to change the way i work , it &apos;s a transformation has saved me this story , a 潜移默化 to change the way i work , it &apos;s a transformation has saved me again . 
it &apos;s not just , it &apos;s completely shit , i began to think i should give up to write this book . 
it &apos;s not just , it &apos;s completely shit , i began to think i should give up to write this book . 
and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 thing , and i tried to try and i remembered for the day , tom 空喊 thing , and i tried to . 
and i looked up and , in this room to one of the manuscript . and i looked up and , to one of the room . 
“ because you can see , i have a shot of committed no kept ” “ because you can see , i have a shot of committed ” . no . 
“ if you want this book better , it &apos;s now your turn them , do you work ” that part . 
if you &apos;re not “ to help , that you see the ” to . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because this is my job . &quot; 
i hope that history today : i 尽责 to 坚守 my jobs € today , i hope that the historical record , i 尽责 坚守 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , and it &apos;s unlikely , but actually happen at a dancer , going beyond that , when the 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you have in a moment , have seen that . 
it seems to stop , dancers was across the time to stop , across the dancer like he did . and before the 1000场 performance , and there &apos;s no difference , but all of these amazingly it up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom , and this is the sacred shine . 
and people know exactly what it is , they can make it was called the name of the people know exactly what it is , they can call out of it . 
we all know , that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some incredible for the magic , people will 喝彩 : “ -- oh , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 , oh , great -- really , really great , incredible ” that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up the tricky for artists , is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on a tuesday morning , that was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
and it is that when bad leg , and you &apos;re going to people , and he might last night , couldn &apos;t get that level . 
maybe no longer there will be in his dancing , 喝彩 god with him , and good , there are going to do ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of one of our self . 
this is a very hard question , which is the most painful for my self , understanding of this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of one of our self . 
but maybe , we were all suffering that if you were never thought , it &apos;s wonderful work of art completely from you , if you were never thought , it &apos;s wonderful work of art completely from you . 
so if we look at this point , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
in your 坚守 jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
in your 坚守 jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
if not , it &apos;s just keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs , and i still 喝彩 for you : 欧 嘞 . 
if not , it &apos;s just keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs , and i still 喝彩 for you : 欧 嘞 . 
and i believe that we have to teach the idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
欧 嘞 . 
in 2009 , al gore here at ted global shows the new situation , think this is a more than scientists to worry about that , and he for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore and to climate trends . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about the north polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last thing in the area of the equivalent of the united states is 48 state 缩减 a 40 percent . 
but that didn &apos;t really make this problem . it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the climate system beating heart 
in the summer 舒张 , the heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is a permanent ice 冻 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue is a year in the winter and summer ice 冻 permanent ice . 
what “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or more time , and the ice , you see , it &apos;s like the body to move to a 各部 . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect of the arctic ocean around 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon and 解冻 干冰 . it &apos;s methane , carbon compost . 
if you break the little , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the light in alaska in the water is you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the sink , which is a heat heating . 
this is one of the last year . 
but it has to be better than traffic 往年 . 
this is greenland southwest kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of the ice melts , to make sea level rise here is the 入海口 
here are 急速 traffic . 
antarctica , the other side of the planet earth , the ice . 
last month , on the continent , scientists are in decline of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s on 20 feet of sea level , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
from 40 percent of the world to its molten water half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of the drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
the world is in the fire and dry in numbers . 
and the world &apos;s population are disasters in absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years , in time to the 总数 earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years , we increase 七千万吨 every day to the co2 emissions 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
look at the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of the big reasons , in the forest destruction is 20 percent of the burning fossil fuels . 
oil and coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution is to build a use more carbon of the planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
there &apos;s been recently discovered and some of the new green alternative . 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry , last year , spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth , in my home in tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
can you see on the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of coal industries are . 
coal is cool , and i &apos;m the embodiment of happiness . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive economy , and he helped us . 
and coal cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
this is west virginia , a lot of coal , the 产地 . 
the big is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and one of the president now to two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal explaining coal mine , and the truth . 
in fact , coal , not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , not for global warming and . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plant . 
some 喧哗 spectacular machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and burning coal is causing global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , the climate crisis . 
these are all the strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products are like on foreign oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve the problem of projects . 
america repower with 100 percent renewable electricity in 10 years . 
the ability to get people to work , we live more safe , and it &apos;s not in warming . 
and finally , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america , about more . 
the final 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to the less dependent on the fastest way . 
this was the wind and solar power , and new energy . 
the new investment to create a huge job . 
repower . it &apos;s time to america &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables -- you can think about a toy . 
first of all , i want you to remember that you &apos;re in the age of being a kid with a kit . 
when you design , and how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re learning how to think about and problem solving . this is the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that help us very 空间结构 around for a lot of learning things . 
this would be the question is , in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so we have this infant siftables . 
simply , is a siftable interaction , as many of the big cookie . 
you can siftables hands just move , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can have with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
the tools that are independent , more sensitive to each other , with all its senses , mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it is in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , maybe , then images in the opposite direction , and maybe . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a 挨 a out ok , interesting is going to happen . 
and if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that there &apos;s a kind of chaos . 
they can perceive moves each other , and maybe . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures and siftables , like a liquid that down from the color of the siftable into a siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there &apos;s three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put it into the barrel of color in the middle of that , along with the color . 
if it more , can you go back a few . 
siftables and learning machine function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , one -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , more quickly see it . 
this is , i &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- so -- so this is a simple equation , i have a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
this &quot; play games together as a way that the , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together to make words , siftables in the dictionary , the automatic find words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word that they have to change that letter , make the right word , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because in the use of siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that playing games together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , and this is a “ together words ” game , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen on other people to experience siftables . 
the bottom right corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just wanted to of siftables together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now the screen that is a function of trying to interact with it . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the children &apos;s felix . 
he can get some new images to add elements on it , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animation images which image , you can bring these new element to put it on . 
see , he put up to the sun . 
the sun it up . 
david and he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
put it in siftables shake . it &apos;s able to add to the new element . he put up a new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing his own story of it . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he &apos;s planning to do that story plot . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables . that &apos;s the sound domain , can make , like the 超载 and bess and drum voice . 
and there &apos;s 四档 tiles for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into the siftable by the way you like . 
voice , just to put sound to block the modules . 
there &apos;s this 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
and this kind of tiles sound can come close to the sound . 
so , we can use to control , and the rhythm and volume of the modules siftable to come to adjust the siftable rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the 超载 into the two tiles , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now , in some 打击乐器 voice . 
now , to come to a voice were drums , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to just accelerated pace of rhythm to come to the tiles . 
now , and then bring a voice to the tiles shellfish tiles sound filter . 
music playing in the process , and to 编排 . 
so , don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s playing , over time , but can play a short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with the volume of the tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so . thank you . 
as you see , my work is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want to talk to you with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 of technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
