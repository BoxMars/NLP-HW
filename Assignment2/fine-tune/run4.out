this is a rapture . and national geographic by wade davis the chance to aboriginal culture , the great diversity culture , it &apos;s an alarming rate . from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
and , of course , we are all with a adaptive . 
we are born in 母腹 and 生儿育女 in the world 
we have an adult sculpted by millennia of girl . 
we have to cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance in 排遣 life 苦楚 we make art . 
but you can see that every culture in the rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
we have all this to give you a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 . 
if you &apos;re thinking about it . you can think of the kind of get to see 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture intertwined in the life of the earth . it for the 芸芸众生 of a very important in what we call the internet as the biosphere . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity . it &apos;s a very strong , we have the ability to look at the species . 
and by the biosphere . and as a species and the same shorter , and it is more expensive . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet , there were six : 00 a language . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is a human shining . 
and it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the physical world 承 dictionary . 
every language is an idea that a and a mental ecosystem 沉淀 and they have . 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we in the same number of the language in half of them don &apos;t have to teach . 
the language has no 传人 that do this . and they will completely . 
imagine you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re last say 本族语 . you can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t -- for the future is this how lonely and scary . 
and that &apos;s one of the earth , about every two weeks , there &apos;s a 年长者 仙逝 and it &apos;s an with a language . 
or 科基语 
you see , you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore the race to the species , and you have a context for what &apos;s happened , and you see are death civilization . 
it &apos;s a lot of people have to the . i said “ different way of ” . i said “ different ” way . 
for example this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 -- we in the world that they &apos;re called the 蚺 race , because they believe in a time , they come from the 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
it can &apos;t tell us have blue and green is because forest and the 栖身 , so they , in the forest canopy 天穹 and not . 
they say , with a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that as a 通婚 异族 went to the people with a different languages married . 
this was the mythology of memory . and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 . you never see 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i &apos;ve been working in the northeast of ecuador 华拉尼 to one of the most amazing in first year i was in 1958 , and they had to peace . 
1957 man to five years to them , but they made a fatal . 
they have in the next eight to 十张 with them . we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think that live in 雨林中 . never seen two-dimensional . 
and the forest and pick up these pictures and images to get over to try to find the people that person , but it doesn &apos;t and they think this is a call to devil . and they use with spears 戮 this man five . 
and it &apos;s not just the 华拉尼 戮 , no . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population was their people 戮 . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 that nature &apos;s 两例 . we 刨根问底 they finally , the people of the 年迈 wood is going to do more , they will 戮 and 送终 for him . 
on the other hand , they have a forest and 惊诧 perspective . 
they can do a predator to 40 of several hundred yards away the urine . and know that &apos;s what the urine . 
to understand the way i have to get this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was not a voodoo to have a dark . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 world . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some of the world is going to show you what religion . 
so christianity , islam and other religion . 
voodoo -- in the in life , and it &apos;s the connection . 
life in the spirit . 
and the rhythm to dance 翩翩起舞 can 大水 to a point of the soul , as a life in the short time for the shining 侍僧成 . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
and the temple in a dance . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . you &apos;ll get hurt ? 
and i have to have all of life in the northern in colombia 玛尔塔 科基人 the of the most remarkable . 
this is in the tyranny of civilization descent , they were once conquered and take over the columbia off the plain 此后 . they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this 肆虐 go in the world that have never been the the people . 
and to their 续 today in the monk . but they will , very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like to go back to 母腹 are taught the values that have values that maintain the relationship to the . we can call it the . 
this is a beautiful , you want to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 called 弟兄 to say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
and the mountain . that &apos;s the shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s a that this is a relationship with nature . 
i &apos;m british columbia as the jungles of the people &apos;s thoughts . i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you look at it this way , you see these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll see them in different ways . 
this is a picture i in august in the northwest amazon . 
it &apos;s 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 dead on many of you have heard of it is a very potent spirit and 萨满教 徒 plant to use it on water -- and make psychedelic drugs . 
and this is a work and the color is it in the brain with five 羟 color is very close to 成份 . 
jamie 亚诺马 . people are from a five -- 羟 color is plants extract it and it took crack nose . 
if you have to take a powder that you can see the 光怪陆离 . in a very exciting . 
now , in front of you don &apos;t deformed were totally wiped out , but 
but the color of is not oral because they are the organ that is called this 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
and that is to oral . there is going to change and oral 氧化酶 . the other chemicals . 
and this is the 藤本植物 . 咔 啉 β -- you can actually 氧化酶 and is going to work with the color is so you 不由得 to ask . 
when we do all kinds of experiments , and make it measure it . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes that people in the dead on all of them in the forest , and that we think they &apos;re different . 
if you ask , how are they give the hierarchy , and they said , i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , i don &apos;t know . 
so i tell you they say , if the months circle of the things in the night to every plant in different little , singing to you . 
it &apos;s not that you get in at harvard . but it &apos;s much more 报表 calculus is more fun . 
now . we have this question , and some of us with the aboriginal people had thought they 离群索居 丰富多彩 life , but as we develop these people on the back to the in history . 
and all cultures have been new way of life as a strong . 
this is not the technology . 
in the race , and people down 弓箭 still is the great sioux nation and the people who 骑马 to go and sit 马车 . it &apos;s still in the united states . 
and in the threat 完整性 not change the technological innovation , and it &apos;s the line all he was barbaric . 
we take of tibet and where i made a lot of research , where you can see the repressive brutal . 
and in the genocide is the same denounce genocide and cultural . it &apos;s people do lifestyle 行径 no opinion is , in many places , and it was a part of this is the strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel pain with tibet . 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the people in china , he was killed . 
his uncle and other fled together to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family 成份 and be 关押 . 
and he had his mother two 悄悄地 to which he in dress and bring him into his because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and be 学习班 into . 
one day she has to be not on the face of a hair 臂章 , which is a country of guilty 劳教 seven years . 
the pain of tibet and you have to human salvation to see you . 
and so we &apos;re going to have a choice is that we want to live in a world still need to a 五彩缤纷 , diversity . 
and finally , we have in the world is in the 10,000 year it will make you feel . 
新石器 time to the human into the agricultural age we girl , he went to the seeds 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra for 祭 for us to the level of 社会分工 . it &apos;s 10 : 00 years ago . 
the modern society and almost 三百年 . 
and i think it &apos;s a brief history , and let &apos;s have the ability to have to solve the challenges . 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 a different . 
and the song , we &apos;re going to find as human beings , we have another possibility , a species that have to realize that we have to make sure that the race and all of those 昌盛 to live with . 
this is a picture i 巴芬岛 in the northern part of the mountain . and i and some are inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 . i go to a about his legacy of the story . 
in the 1950s , they don &apos;t have to treat inuit people to build a sovereign we away by them to make 定居点 . 
this is the old man to move . 
his family was worried about all the weapons and put it all away . 
you know , the inuit people on fear and their god , it alone . 
they sledge . the first slide in north america train 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
it &apos;s the man and not the of the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he &apos;s slept in a out of his seal 长裤 , he took a stool and they make up these stool stiff , he made it into a blades . 
and in this shit to make the blades in the make 口水 . it &apos;s frozen and become very solid , he used it to a dog 刀子 宰杀 . 
剥 down , and as a 挽具 he and his dog sleds made out of them to the dog in that when you don &apos;t have to do with shit , in ice sheet . 
it &apos;s 空手 make life . 
in many ways . this is the inuit people in the world of the indigenous 顽强 写照 real life force . 
1999 four months to the area of the than in texas and 之和 is to the land , and returned back to new haven . 
i &apos;m the new home , it &apos;s new le , dimensions . 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is good , a country that you want to do something with it between people . 
and i think for ever in the world , some remote people is not remote . 
because it &apos;s a 族类 home . 
they are the branches of human imagination , go back to the ancient times the for all of us , these kids . and our children &apos;s dream of the world to a part of the future . 
so we &apos;re in a national geographic and which can do is we believe and don &apos;t do . 
we think . don &apos;t try to convince people , but we think about in the world to get so we can change the world &apos;s at about it . the site of a it up to the three of thousands of five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have a million people . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas did this stunning photosynth , this software , you can change the way we see what . use images from the name of a static , photosynth created an absolute brute . like magic , and you can go all around it . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
here we see many many gb 千兆 byte . and level of digital photographs , and they can do it up and flat , by the way to mapping through them , can do to rearrange them . 
and we can see how many and image how much of the image , and how much seadragon , have this ability to deal with . 
so most of you are a digital camera picture taken , but this one is , it &apos;s a different from the library of congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it and no difference , because the system . it &apos;s the only thing is , you can use the like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , the data is an image . 
this is what dickens had 荒凉 山庄 the line , &quot; what is the chapter . 
i &apos;ll show you that this is really text and the picture , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s a read the book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more of it , it &apos;s a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
and here is a 张大 of the opening . 
and in the or the paper , which contains the percentage of the images , reading , people get better the experience , and have read it . 
here we made small change in it a &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture . this is just -- you see the ad higher resolution , the picture of the extra embedded in it . 
if you want to see that the car , you can see here . 
you can see other version , and technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to use it on the screen is limited . 
we want this technology will reduce unnecessary play out the window and all the information . 
obviously , with this technology , number one . and it &apos;s one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to do this in my whole . 
this is the nasa geography of the space . 
to 叠加 and get on the road map . 
now , let &apos;s put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you to experience it . 
the project called or photosynth , it actually two different things . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from the university of washington graduate school , and when noah had snavely can do at the end of the visual . it &apos;s got this , steve seitz university . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful to work . 
this project we &apos;ve got on the internet , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , for us to do with the way of looking at , and to do with the subtlety 剖析 and have a lot of experience to resolution . 
but , in the image of three . it &apos;s actually very significant . 
i &apos;m not sure if we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot more of this space , and it . 
because we make the site , to take care of the law . 
these are all from flickr . this is in space , it &apos;s 串联 . 
and so , we can easily go to do . 
. in fact , i never thought i would and microsoft for . 
so , it really is to be happy . 
i think you can see that the images from a lot of different camera phone , and to get to the other one . so a lot of different , and the quality of being in the environment into building in . 
let me get some kind of weird . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
i think we should have a series of the -- well , here . 
this is the notre dame , in paris . 
we can get to the , to look to the environment . 
here &apos;s the point that we have to work with the community . we can start to get everybody . everybody from the environment and gather together so we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , is a much more than just to collect it up . 
this model of the crime , the earth . 
it &apos;s like stephen lawler , &quot; this is &quot; the long tail . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
their images , are you on the 注 . 
thank you very much . 
if i get the right , the software , you will be in the next few years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software is really , is to explore . 
it was in this building , the link . 
the 接合 . it &apos;s based on the content of the picture . 
more exciting is that this is a semantic that information . 
so , what you &apos;re in the picture , the key on the web , and the text is going to have a lot of information that with this picture . 
now , imagine these pictures , and all of you to , that would be like ? 
and so the semantic information to each other , and a link in is . it &apos;s a very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 , to the time . 
i want to here to talk about this in a part of it . and you have to hear a few things with that if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a recognized the principles of it . 
well , what the standard ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society 笃信 疑 is not a principles . 
well , this is that , if we want to get to the people on the benefits of the way is to get people to free to maximize . 
and it &apos;s with that . it was wonderful , valuable , for people to that . 
and once you have the freedom , all of us can 做主 ourselves with all the way on the benefits , don &apos;t have to get people to for we 做主 . 
so , to be a way that is a more on the selection . 
people more choices , , which is much more freedom , from the benefits that the more . 
i think , the idea that 掺 like in the water that age-old in that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
and the idea is really embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples , and the social . let &apos;s get going to be doing something . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
i just want to talk about the salad ingredients . 
you see , it &apos;s like the supermarkets . 
and you turn out to be a one to do it a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s the one in a three-dimensional sound system that has a much . 
and in the components that you can have 650万种 to all of the things pop-up sound system . 
you can &apos;t don &apos;t say it &apos;s a choice of . 
in a world , which is . 
i was a kid , it was to the called service , which have to go to the company , and that &apos;s a . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
and that is going to the dead are not bad . 
when that are 一去不返 . 
now that we have an infinite taxonomy is a mobile phone , and you know , it looks . 
these are the phone . 
and i &apos;d 津津乐道 -- in the middle of it will take mp , the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you &apos;re not in the next to your store saw it , don &apos;t worry about it , and how do you see . 
and the thing is , they went to the store , and if you have there with a function of this ? &quot; 
you want to , say , &quot; what is it ? 
answer is no ” “ . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a not so much of what that device . 
and in the life of some of them for more than we have on the things that are up to the same . 
health care -- in the united states , it &apos;s not that you are to the doctor , so again , they tell you how to do the time . 
instead , you get there , and they said to you , we can use therapies nail , can you 乙 . 
a very nail . and so forth and risk . 
and so forth . a very 乙 and risk . you want to watch how ? 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
they said , again , a nail these things and risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
you have to ask : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you find that ” ? 
they said , “ , but i don &apos;t you ” . 
now the prescription over the ad , is that these people with you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s like , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why should we do to the market ? 
answer is , they want to look at the advertising , to the next morning to my doctor to call the prescription drugs to the change in their . 
and like the gender of all the other thing to talk to , like this slide is to it . 
now we can &apos;t be the parents , and it received by their , but to make . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
which means every morning you woke up to you right now , you want to do a kind of men and women -- and make decisions . 
the marriage of the family , and everybody to marry that old , and this is of course , and that is 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing that you need to and who are married , and not what i was , it &apos;s not married , do . 
and now it , all the things that you have to pick 拣 挑拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart . good , but now i give them all placed homework is one of the time . five . 
it &apos;s not because they and their than ever before , stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not and who . 
the brain , and they are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask yourself , what i &apos;m not going to get married married ? what is it ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 work ? 
this is a 脑筋 . 
the question , they have to say , if they &apos;re still don &apos;t do all placed my homework , whether they in my class . it &apos;s a . 
they did it to the problem , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now , as karl that do work , and we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in the day , every time , in a work in the corner -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but the restaurant in a place where it can wireless online , and i don &apos;t tell you are . 
don &apos;t tell you the reason i wanted to use . 
anyway , we work -- the freedom to give us what we have to have the to make decisions , again , again , again , to work , and that &apos;s right , and the rest . 
we go to the kid play football , a 裤兜 it in the phone , and it in a 裤兜 with their blackberry blackberry . so , it goes on in the laptops . 
even though they &apos;re off , we are looking at in their 场上 rivals for and continue to ask ourselves , so i &apos;m not the phone ? 
and it &apos;s not the email ? i don &apos;t have to write this an 信稿 ? 
if you give my answer is no , you &apos;re a kid . &quot; it &apos;s also a 打折扣 . 
look around , and a little thing . it &apos;s the matter , it &apos;s way of life , is to take . 
we live in the world like that . 
that is , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to do . 
today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s a good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know it &apos;s good . so let me say this is a bad . 
all these choices for people , and the two . two negative impact . 
one , it kind of an oxymoron , is to give us , and -- that &apos;s not up and down , but paralyzed . 
so many people have to that very difficult to make decisions . 
let me give you for a very vivid example to do that , it &apos;s a about pension in and out of this do . 
one of my colleagues access to the vanguard of investment . vanguard is a huge for a company , with about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
and that was when the people and they want to give a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is two percent . 
you have 50种 foundation , kind of a people than you have 5种 foundation , . 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 foundation to have to choose to you that this is even more difficult , so you can actually trying in tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s get more , you &apos;ll be tomorrow &apos;s , of course , we will never come . 
don &apos;t go to the project , and they have a lot of things about 5千元 employer 对等 from 手边 溜掉 . employer was really like to pay for it . 
so , the more likely to have the rigid paralyzed . 
it makes the world into this slide , and it looks like that . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to do the right , right ? 
there you really don &apos;t want to have a foundation , and it &apos;s ingredients from there . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , and that &apos;s ridiculous , something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy to make that choice . 
secondly , economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today , dan gilbert about a 大道理 is , we see a thing . the way we used it to the other things . 
well , when they have to think of it , and it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you go to the interesting thing , and that makes you all to you is one of the think 美中不足 . 
for example , that -- and it , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but it &apos;s you right now to think about . 
look at the hamptons two 口子 . 
because of the rich . 
the of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
you can better than that ? it &apos;s going on , and “ huh , really , it &apos;s bad ” “ in august , ” . 
so the “ neighbors are not home ” . 
“ i want to go back to the car in front of me and the ” . 
and for two weeks , he was the idea was suffering , every day in 念叨 is lost to the right to parking . 
“ opportunity cost to ” always to have to do with this actually not even to a 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to the people , and that &apos;s more , and all these things in the opportunity cost . 
it &apos;s an example . 
this cartoon means for . 
it says that the “ live in the ” the it . maybe there &apos;s one way to do things . 
but , in a sense , when you have to do something , and that , you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing is to have a lot of you here , and you &apos;re in to do for you glamorous . 
and third , 增高 expectations . 
this was once i buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the jeans , is that a pattern , you get back , pants appropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you get it to be a long time , with a million times , and get pants 凑合 . 
so , this in many years old pants , i finally 上街 to buy a new . i said , “ feed , i want to a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , , or 宽松 , ? 
the first to 扣子 and the locked ? 石磨 and with this ? 
you just a quick them ? 
and it , and it &apos;s a ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
i &apos;ve got off . and i was 缓 through it , and i said , “ i &apos;m going to that was the only kind of pattern ” . 
he fog and water , and i took a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i can take a me the most 合身 pants out of the door . 
i do it . and that &apos;s not . i have to do better . 
but there it was even worse . 
why ? is it that i wrote a book for me to make excuses . 
and i felt worse reason is because there &apos;s so much , as i do , for a jeans is that there &apos;s good to be a good expectations . . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i don &apos;t get much . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , better at least have a 极致 is perfect . 
it &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i get i had to and i want you to do , and i hope that it is , this is a more disappointing . 
and the people in to live together , except for that , you know what to expect a lot of good and no other people how to do that . 
that &apos;s just to make people and less happy , even though it was the better . 
to the people that people don &apos;t know it , because if they and , you know , you don &apos;t have to know what it means . i mean . 
it &apos;s like this and in it , in all of them are very hard , and it &apos;s better than now . 
and when one of the things that are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , in our these rich , industrial civic life in the world , perfect . it &apos;s of course , for every one of the things you only want it worse than you would expect . 
you will not be what do you know , because i expect no higher than it . 
what is the secret to happiness , and here you want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t want a high . 
so , now i want you to talk about a minute , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a great wife . 
this is the thing that i didn &apos;t 凑合 , to me . 
but to 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of on the jeans for you , you get to a back , it were , and you ask , why , who do ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
out there and hundreds of the jeans , you have no excuse to come down on the thing . 
and it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be a good , and they were so disappointed -- to decide , to blame myself . 
and for our generation , the industrialized countries in the world . and if any of this explosive growth . 
and the net effect , even though the objective do better than ever before , but they don &apos;t feel like from the . 
i &apos;ll tell you . 
this and bring it to -- well , the standard , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
and we have to better than no choice , but not to picture that more is better . 
there &apos;s a key , and i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond ‘ ’ in it . we need to this point , . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for the industrial society , so many choices , that &apos;s great . good . 
the world , and in many places , at least , we heard a few of them , and there &apos;s not too much . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;ll talk about this . it &apos;s on a particular western society . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday said , and 气愤 question is , we make the expensive and it &apos;s the 于事无补 car seats , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is the expensive and complicated . it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually give us all . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not from the like . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and to do it . 
and you will move all of that , not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a pandemic was affecting our another . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , the fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish , it &apos;s not possible ” . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , what &apos;s it . 
but i think is the obvious that it was fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you have not freedom , but i really fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you &apos;re down happiness . 
you increase the is paralyzed by , is to . 
everyone needs “ ” this fish . 
in this fish and -- for this fish , it &apos;s a little bit , and that we must be a little . 
but there &apos;s a symbolic fish that is going to , and who is a disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i have to talk about this project , part of the human genome and . and what they found a new genome . 
and we &apos;re in a new perspective , we &apos;re working with digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the code to a new design in biology , with synthetic life . 
we always trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” , i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
and now we have to almost 20 years to go to the . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , and it was in biology and entered the world of the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , we could build any life , or are we in the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , and mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome in the lab to make it replicate . and we &apos;re trying to do what we find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 from the genes from 一百组 out is that we can see here . 
so , we think the only way to go on a synthetic chromosome . and so we can change the part of the basic question to go . 
so we started along the way we can go to the “ synthetic ” ? 
one of the really allowed us to make that we have a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a couple of the , by the way , is something that we live with the chemicals . 
our digital lives , and in on it faster . 
we can write the code . it is to slow down , but it &apos;s growing . we &apos;ve . it &apos;s going to put up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
and it and for this . we do the experiment , before i have a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it &apos;s synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world . there &apos;s 十几万台 in the little pieces of dna , which , in 30 to 50 character , and this is a process of decline , made the long time , that the more and more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way . out of this piece together , and it all wrong . 
this is the first to phi x 174 , from the bacteriophage and -- to digital information . 
a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we made the gene pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 . the length . 
the most exciting when we put it in a live there as chemicals in the bacteria , put that up to the reader , to make the virus particles . 
and then to release the virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli 革 and 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i have with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , and i think they &apos;re very well understood this model . 
he was out loud of more than you . 
so we think this is actually software to a biological system . they built the hardware . 
it &apos;s very important , and if you &apos;re on the using digital information . that &apos;s really true to that information . 
when we first in 1995 , to the set of genes -- is , right , and it &apos;s 10,000 for a mistake . 
in fact , we find , and by the time , on average , 30 is wrong . and if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
it &apos;s part of the work for the piece of 50 . and the other 50 . the 叠加 to build a little smaller units of the time . we have to design , they can together . 
and there &apos;s a design of the unique . 
you may have heard of the to 水印 . 
think about gene code . there are four : a , c , g and t . 
and the character of 三联 -- and the character 编成 about 20 amino acids amino acids , and this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , we can do is to look for it . 
some people kind of what we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we created the time to use and enzymes to 裁 . some enzyme , is to fix them and put them together . 
and we started to create pieces , from 7000 . the piece of to put them together make 24 , the length of time . people and 几组 to combine piece , to people , at a time . 
in every stage , we produce a lot of time and so we can give them -- because we want to create a very good for a minute . you &apos;re going to see . 
we try to get an automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 of . 
when these very big piece , over 100 people on it , they &apos;re hard to keep the e . coil . for a long , and try to make a molecular biologist in all of the tools we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred are in biology , to repair . it &apos;s time to put that together . 
there &apos;s an example of that is a little radiation to 三百万度 球菌 with the amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , the chromosomes and nieces around . 
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s going to your back , and before the first . 
we have 千种 can do it . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move in a new have water . 
in fact , they have to show you a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a we take this molecule microscopic . through this process . it &apos;s about what the yeast . and we put it right , design pieces . yeast automatically aggregates them . 
it &apos;s not the microscope . ; it &apos;s just a optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
this is a , about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the with this . 
it &apos;s more than a 580000 . the gene code . this is set by the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we find in 10号 distance , not to print it out . it takes 142页 into the genetic code . 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
it &apos;s a very simple to do with a bacteria that much . 
we do something like that . it &apos;s a very simple , you can take a the nucleus , and the into other cells , that &apos;s what you hear something about it . 
for the bacteria , and with the cells into the 连成 , but now we know that we can do a whole list of the chromosome from one cell to move the cells and activate it . 
the new into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we &apos;re going to the design process to some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that for a second of all species or from other parts of the third side , in a second 数千种 new increased . to its own . 
and by that is in the process of evolution , and just have a genetic change lost . it &apos;s a lot of things . 
there &apos;s an enzyme . it is to think of it . 
to the cells don &apos;t think that don &apos;t think that when we think this is the into a chromosome . 
it was out and work out the other one is no matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a have a new dna . 
we put the genes it to a blue . 
in very short period of time , all be gone . the species , and it into a new species on , we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , in fact that we put into it . 
this might sound like the 炼金术 , but we can do it in the world , and to change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the -- this is a century to 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of life is based on this digital new species . 
why do that ? 
i think , for some . we do that is very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own , and i was born in 1946 . 
the world would be the three people in every one of us are from 1946 , is the people in the next 40 years , in a four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 food for people , clean fresh water , the fuel , the very difficult . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil . it &apos;s 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this , or anything that we can replace it . and it &apos;s a huge challenge . 
and , of course , is that the material that was in the co2 emissions in . 
we &apos;re from around the world that &apos;s a about 两千万组 genetic database , and i like to see them as the design components . 
it &apos;s the electric industry to a components , so let &apos;s get diversity . 
now , the limits of from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have the technology , because they can make we call the mixing of “ ” rapidly synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to make the a day . 
and this is a choice . we can start to have to live , or chemical production , for the . and so on . 
this is a -- this is the thing is that we actually sit on in the computer to design the species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code , it looks like . 
we &apos;re starting to in “ 第四代 ” fuel . 
and you see the corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations of fuel . it &apos;s into a high value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
and the co2 is one of the way -- 
so , now -- but we from around the world that we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a , that was in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep . about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
we are looking to collect the . no , really , they &apos;re very easy to get a handle on , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we may increase in &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic understanding . 
we do with a whole oil industry , the little 化工 . so , now , if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where you &apos;re going ? as a major energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tools made 几组 the time . 
you see in this case , we tend to slow the time of year , and in this case , they really useful vaccine . 
i think this is what can they were making up to change . 
this is the future are going on with change , this evolutionary tree , with synthetic bacteria , and that &apos;s a really 古物 and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the . our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , it can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 . at a ted u , brian cox : the shares some which are the 对撞机 . it &apos;s now , to repair and the history of the big science . 
brian cox : the lhc . a what ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you have to go back to it . it is the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state , every second 6亿次 and make the state . 
it &apos;s ambitious 
this is the 日内瓦 in that . 
we use it to some camera and a that . 
this is that i worked at this on , atlas 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
it &apos;s atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this one . 
this is a atlas in the next . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is one of these clusters of the way around , the lhc . we &apos;re going to the lhc . and , in part of a 辐 go flying off of it . 
in other words , when we see in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a big success . 
i don &apos;t know the got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when you go to google , saw that graph front page . 
that means that we do is as a culture that and the science as a shock . 
but about a week later , we have a sort of the machine with these 导线 about -- the golden 导线 . 
and they 导线 transmission and 安培 when it started . 
now some of you might say “ . no , it is . it &apos;s ” . 
they can do it , because when it is , it &apos;s a superconducting 导线 . 
so in about 271摄氏度 than in the space on the case that 导线 can transmission and electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in of a 接点 with for a mistake . 
so 导线 . is it a little bit to the transmission it 安培 and they and their resistance 
it is . 
very shocking , because the magnets up to 20 tons , they move about a ruler miles . 
there are about 50 magnet . 
they have to have to 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now , waiting for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 to be called the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to start it , and in june , july , to get to data and we find out of the most of it . 
it &apos;s clear that now , one of the accident 激化 to a cutting-edge science and engineering argument , but it &apos;s easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s very difficult . it &apos;s still in my we want the truth is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love , and with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love , and with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love , and with life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a special . but , in my life and work , has a special things that i have to rethink and between my work . 
and it turns out , and if i , where people think this is the result is that life , and if i , where people think that this is my life . 
so , really , really , not to save , play 完了 . 
they &apos;re very up here , and i said , “ . don &apos;t you ? don &apos;t you in my life . this is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to do it . &quot; 
i was in the same question is , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you don &apos;t of for you to get otherwise it ? 
you end up is in the dream of death and despair , in all the 苦痛 . i was always get that question . 
and the question , the simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of all of it , until today . 
yes , this kind of all of it , until today . 
and for that , i &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t think that &apos;s all that , i &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , and other things . 
but the fear of writing , and i was thinking , why would i fear of writing ? but , the fear of writing , and i was thinking , why would i fear of writing ? 
this is it a better idea ? 
people in the destiny of our work that is that ? people in the destiny of our work that is that ? 
no one said , “ john , do chemistry in bottleneck ? how ” ? 
never would have happened to it . 
and of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer the group doesn &apos;t in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of the century , the great geniuses in which they 英年早逝 case just look at the early years of the century , the great geniuses in which they 英年早逝 is often in the age of light die . 
even if the suicide , no , it doesn &apos;t have to a their talent , not even if the suicide , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent . 
and the 曼梅 le , died in the last time ago , and i said , “ in every one of the book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
in your work life , this is a kind of radical . 
i want to ask all of you , you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you , you have no dispute about that ? 
you think this one . no . what ? if a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even further from a look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 
but that &apos;s 可憎 , and it , i don &apos;t want to have this idea of the century

and for me , believed that it will i in the dark 绝境 and for me , believed that it will i in the dark 绝境 , especially in my work now . especially in my work now . 
you know , i was young , i have to 40 years old , you know , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
and i have about 40 years of life . 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , and i said , is in my heart , and , very good , it &apos;s in my life is over . 
oh my god , what is this idea . 
is this idea , it took a 大清早 is one of the piano . don &apos;t understand . is this idea , it took a 大清早 is a way to the piano . no . i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
and deep thinking about it , for me to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance away from the writing , and i work in response to the very anxious , the writing , and i &apos;m a response extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and the rome . 
so just bear with me , because you end up to around us . 
in the ancient greek and the roman , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the people in the ancient greek and the roman , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the people in the ancient greek and the roman , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human . 
people believe , is to create a sacred away from the djinn , and not to know where the next artist , with a remote and you know , from far away . you know , where all the artists , with a remote and you know . 
the for people to call it a with creative , to the djinn “ 守护神 ” for 
and for people to think socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 from a distance , what he was in for people to think socrates , there &apos;s a 守护神 , he &apos;s from a distance . 
the people that i have a similar , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” on the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this is a wonderful , because i didn &apos;t think of the “ ” is a very 聪慧 personal and a good idea , because i didn &apos;t think of the “ ” is a very 聪慧 individuals . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking at the . that &apos;s what makes people 成败 from work on protecting mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
the artist by this point and get out of it , not one of the artist by this idea , and get out of one of you . 
if you work great . that &apos;s not because it to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of the “ ” work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
we all know that &apos;s because you on a bad ” “ . 
this is in the western for a long time about creativity . 
and i want to say , i think it &apos;s a big . 
and the 无异 to swallow the sun , this is the vulnerable individual , is too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of the cognitive , and for people to do this . this was a completely straight up twisted , one of the cognitive , and that was done for people to the . 
i think that &apos;s the pressure , in the last 500 years of the artist . i think that &apos;s the pressure , in the last 500 years of the artist . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think are so the question is : so how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : so how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to the older , to see them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to the older , to look at them and to understand human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a a 18 minutes , which , 抹杀 developed 500多年 out of the reason we don &apos;t mind with a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 out of the reason . 
now , i can convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why not in a way of thinking about this ? i mean , why not ? why not in a way of thinking about ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why not in a way of thinking about ? 
this is , for any was trying to make people believe that there are you had this kind of experience will know it &apos;s not always rational . 
in fact , it is . and we can make sense . 
like a 雷鸣 . where , in her , really . 
she can see it , because this is a force 撼动 she starts to the ground . 
she can see it , because this is a force 撼动 she starts to the ground . 
and now , she can be the only thing , and she said , is to “ 死命 狂奔 ” 
in other , and that &apos;s what i call the amazing part , the other , and that &apos;s what i call the amazing part , and she said something , she was about to 错过 poem . 
and she &apos;s on the other hand , and the poem with 顺势 and put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 顺势 and put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper . 
and this , that would 完好无缺 , in the order of what it &apos;s upside down , from the beginning of the word , after all , go to the first . 
i heard her story and , like , is amazing , and it &apos;s my in the process , but it &apos;s not what i do all this , i &apos;m not a pipe , my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 , and as i have to get out of it . but even 古板 , and as i have to get out of it . 
there , it &apos;s like a lot of people . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i meet and to the idea of where you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have where i come from . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it &apos;s not good loss ? we &apos;re going to see how it &apos;s not good loss ?

the story 潜移默化 to change the way i work , the transformation has saved me this story , a 潜移默化 to change the way i work , and it &apos;s a -- i again .

in spain , when a performer done some amazing examples of this , people will 喝彩 : “ -- oh , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 -- oh , great , really , really great , ” . that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
this is a good way , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky , is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up to about artists , the most tricky , is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 up on that tuesday morning was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with the . 
and it is that when bad leg , and you &apos;re going to the people and , and he couldn &apos;t be that the last night . 
and it will not dance , in his 喝彩 it with his good , there are now going to do ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the process of one of the way .

i believe we have to teach the . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you .

in 2009 , the show , al gore . the world &apos;s new is that , this is more than a have to worry about that , and he for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore and to the climate . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two of the polar ice cap . in the area of 三百万年 it from a 48 state in the united states is 缩减 a 40 percent . 
but that didn &apos;t have that the problem . it &apos;s a rare that ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the heart of this system . 
the 舒张 , in the summer . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years , the 剧 . 
red is 冻 permanent ice . 
you see , it &apos;s into the dark blue is in a form of the year in the summer 冻 permanent ice . 
what “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or more . and the , you know , it &apos;s like the body &apos;s 各部 to move . 
in the 25 years , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect of the arctic ocean around 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon and 解冻 干冰 . it &apos;s methane , carbon compost . 
now , if a greenhouse gas emissions , it &apos;s going to have in the global warming , mass . 
some of the light in alaska in the water is you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last year , in the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
wow . 
she &apos;s now , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , they said in the heat of heat , which . 
this is one of the last year . 
but it &apos;s 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest which kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to know the on how to fix it to sea level rise , and it &apos;s 入海口 . 
there are 急速 traffic . 
the earth , the other side of the planet &apos;s it . 
last month , the continent . they are in decline of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
this is the into the sea level , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is ice 
40 percent of the water from the financial to the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
and for water , it &apos;s a . 
and as you see is , we &apos;re very serious . 
the world is like that in the fire in there . 
and the time , there was a very significant quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years in time , to a first 总数 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we add a 七千万吨 co2 emissions from the 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
and look at the ocean to the area in america , in india , the 两边 含氧量 in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of that , in the 20 percent of the . it &apos;s a . 
it &apos;s most urgent , coal . 
the world is becoming two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution was to build a more carbon of the planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s some of the recently discovered , and that &apos;s a new green . 
and -- but now , in this country has a political . 
and of the carbon and the last year , spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal . that &apos;s . 
the picture of me . 
before and after christmas , in my home in tennessee digging up of billions of the 淤泥 . 
and you see on the news . 
this is the second big were it up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
that &apos;s one of the carbon . 
coal is cool , and to either . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile . he &apos;s up to our economy . 
coal cool every day , more clean 
he sanctuary cute , and they have to work . 
this is west virginia , a lot of coal 产地 the . 
the biggest the head of massey coal mining . 
so this alliance for climate protection and is al gore . and now one of two project of this . 
this is one of these , and one of them . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal for explaining and the coal . 
in fact , coal are not 
we think , it &apos;s clean smell . 
so , don &apos;t for global warming and . 
let &apos;s doing . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at it in the art of clean coal . 
spectacular some 喧哗 machine . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and the burning of the global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the fascinated and clean coal changed everything . 
and look at it . this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
and in the economic crisis , security , climate crisis 
this is going to be the strings together , and it &apos;s based on carbon oil products are like on foreign oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new out of these things . 
america repower with 100 percent up with a time . 
the ability to get people to live and work and security , and it was the warming . 
and finally , a big enough to solve the problem . 
repower america , about a . 
and a 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to the less dependent on the way . 
this was the wind and solar power , and new energy . 
in the new make more money huge . 
repower america . it &apos;s time &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s a in the old saying that if you want to go quickly , the individual . 
if you want to go away , the 结伴 . 
we need to do is go away , and . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables . -- a think toy . 
first of all , i want you to remember what you &apos;re in a play about being a kid . 
when you design a about how to build and to do with it , and you &apos;re learning how to think about and the question . this is the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
that &apos;s what 空间结构 for a lot of the things we &apos;re learning . 
the question would be , and in my mind , and we decided to get the answer , so we have this siftables will . 
basically , siftable with a computer , it &apos;s like a cookie size . 
siftables to move . just 每块 siftable can see each other on each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like the block , can have with . 
and siftables for a new system -- that digital information for it . 
the tools that are more and more sensitive , to see each other , feel any with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to do this simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it on to maybe , and what it is in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe images in it , maybe the opposite direction . 
and these siftables to see each other . 
if you put a 挨 out a good thing , this will happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that there &apos;s a kind of chaos . 
they can sense of each other . and maybe . 
we have an interesting interaction -- we can use a hand siftables and interact with it , like a liquid that from the color of the siftable into a siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there &apos;s three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put it in the water into color in the middle , and which color together . 
if it was more , you can go back a few . 
siftables and machine learning . that &apos;s language , to learn arithmetic and -- and by the way to learn to become 快捷 , faster , and see . 
this is what i &apos;m here to siftables . so -- -- and this is a simple equation , i have a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix . people play . 
people that play a game . we like the , you just take a a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together , as words , siftables in the look at the word itself . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically in the right word that they have to change that the of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
now , so -- thank you . 
now , and -- now , on the screen , is that some kids are in the media ; in the use of siftables experience , i put them . it took off . 
kids love siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is playing the game . together , we don &apos;t have to explain what they . 
just to tell them that &apos;s a “ . put ” game , and they know what to do . 
now that &apos;s on the other people in siftables experience . 
the lower right-hand corner , it &apos;s a is the age of the experience . 
he just wanted to of siftables together . 
in his mind , siftables . it is . 
now the screen that is a function of to interact with it . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
and this is the child felix . 
he can get some new information to the image on it , he can do is to the table siftables take it to be put . that image , you can put it on a new element to it . 
see , he put it to the sun . 
the sun it up . 
david and his tractor . you put it . 
the orange one tractors . 
do good . 
the siftables to shake . it &apos;s a new element to add to the . he put up a new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in , and it &apos;s the story . 
hello . 
this is an open the end of story , he &apos;s planning to plot this out . 
the balloon on and off . 
i &apos;m going to give you a last show this to function in 编排 , playing , is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables . that &apos;s the sound domain , can make like 超载 . and bess and the sound of a drum . 
and there were 四档 , for change , 任君 choice . 
you can think of the voices were siftable . the to come siftable of the way you like . 
you just have to come to sound . the to come . 
and this 响器 , which is a , like the siftable module . 
and this kind of tiles that sound to come to the sound . 
so , to control , and the rhythm and volume siftable were the to come to the siftable the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to get the 超载 into the two tiles , and put some of the 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now , in some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to come and a drums , you can come to the sound . 
i &apos;m going to just up the rhythm of the music to come to come . 
now going to come and a shellfish to come and the filter . 
in the process of the music and to 编排 . 
so don &apos;t have to 编排 , but in the play , over time , it &apos;s a short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with their voice to come to the tiles , on the left in it . 
now , so -- thank you . 
as you see , my work is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction with better in the brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you the siftable , our next research is in the lab to . 
i want to talk to you . we &apos;re working on the next generation -- can technology and the number of 接轨 technology , it &apos;s going to change the world like that , in our generation , you see . 
thank you very much . 
i want to share with you .
