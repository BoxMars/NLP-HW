rapture images and stories through for national geographic , the explorers by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we &apos;re all born into 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send the different perspectives will let you see hope . 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture life intertwined , and the internet to cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also a strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
in biosphere by severe around in circles like also facing the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
and one of the most important is that language . 
we live on this planet , there were six : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is shining human spirit . 
and it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a spiritual ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and our audience in the number of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no 传人 that unless we valid solutions , they will completely . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re a final say 本族语 . you can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our children are not allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks , you have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore the race loop loop race to give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people have forgot . i said “ different way of living ” i mentioned “ ” different ways . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 northwest part of the played methuselah -- they &apos;re called 蚺 that the race because they believe in a time , they come from 米尔克 river 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green , because they &apos;re in the jungle 栖身 , so they &apos;re 天穹 forest canopy , with no difference . 
they say , with a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that as a linguistics 异族 通婚 to the people with a different languages , married people . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
when i was exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had to peace . 
five missionary 1957 years to approach them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they &apos;ve lost the next eight to 10 十张 their pictures of myself as we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think that live in 雨林中 people have never seen a two-dimensional . 
from the forest , they pick up these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people person , but they found nothing and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 dead that five evangelist . 
that &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 戮 at people . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent mortality population was their 戮 to die . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 两例 found only natural death we 刨根问底 they finally goes out to the truth is going to do more 年迈 wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , to the forest , they have astonishing 惊诧 perspective . 
their predator can smell 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world religions give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
born in the spirit . 
the dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 below soul to just replace the birth of the soul in this brief moment 侍僧成 shining for god . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re cathedral to dance . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
and i had access to all of those groups in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 科基人 the mountains of the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization descent , they were once conquered and occupation columbia . the coast in plain 此后 they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent this race has never been the spaniards . 
and to today , they 续 along with monk institutions to govern , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain these values , and with the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful that you need to protect it . 
they call myself 兄长 call for our 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is the mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s a symbol that means that the human relationship with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia as local people &apos;s thoughts . i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll see them different lifestyle . 
this picture are me this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often used it did die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain with five 羟 color is very close to 成份 . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribal person would have from five 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you take a sip into powder that you can see 光怪陆离 hallucinations in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distorted were totally wiped out , but 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be one of your body , one is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
this is matter to oral color , there is going to change and oral 氧化酶 living as any chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that in there -- 藤本植物 β 咔 啉 right is going to be able to control 氧化酶 and play is the potency of color , so you 不由得 to ask myself . 
when we do all kinds of experiments constantly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person found in the death of the cane is they &apos;re in deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask , how are they gave these plants hierarchy , they said , &quot; i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants are not talking about me . 
so i tell you they say , if you &apos;re in months circle of the things that night in the plant , every plant to use the different little singing to you . &quot; 
it &apos;s not going to see you get a ph.d. from harvard , but it &apos;s much more 报表 calculus is more fun . 
dh : now we have this question , and some of us indigenous compassion tragedy think they 离群索居 丰富多彩 life , but as we move the development of these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been inspired by a new way of life as a strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is a great sioux nation indians and americans 骑马 to go and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat race 完整性 layer is not change or technological innovation itself , but power is barbaria up his ideas . 
let &apos;s look at of tibet recently , where i do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the same , but by denounce genocide . it &apos;s cultural destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce in many places it even be a part of this by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family 成份 and be 关押 . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and 学习班 into being . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the face of hair 臂章 and being in a country of seven 劳教 guilty . 
the pain of tibet for people to withstand human salvation to get to see . 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a world still need a 五彩缤纷 diversity , the world . 
we have to think , in the world exist in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 era for human revolution in our agricultural age for the seeds 腊 girl erotic 萨满 poetry is the mantra for cheese 祭 after we created this level of 社会分工 just 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to make that we have the ability to solve the challenges facing 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
and the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that every race , and all of those organisms 昌盛 for life . 
this is a picture i 巴芬岛 in the northern part of the mountain . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people tell me about a legacy of about his grandfather . 
in the 1950s , the government is not always practice inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old man to move . 
his family was worried about security , put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you know , inuit people fear the cold , which is their god , it alone . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he &apos;s slept outside wearing his seal 长裤 , he took a stool in hand when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this shit , put it on the edge of the blades puke 口水 when it &apos;s frozen and become very robust , he used it to 刀子 宰杀 dog . 
the 剥 dogs bark 挽具 and then he made a dog made out of his dog sleds condoms in the middle , and then when you don &apos;t have a shit knife in ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways dh : this is the inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 canada government to an area of texas and california than to the land area 之和 returned back to inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called dimensions , new le 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a terrific shows a country can do something with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and i think for ever in this world some remote people is not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent branches of human imagination go back to the millions of times , for all of us , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make . 
we think dh : try not to convince people , but we think about it , and you can make the world , so we could get to change the world &apos;s at about the institution to our website , a click of thousands of about three to five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from the internet , used to pick out a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and can navigate it . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is many many gb and 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can do for smooth , and you can zoom in , by the way mapping through them , and we can do to rearrange them . 
and see how much data sets , images have a lot of the images , and how much seadragon , has this processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system , the only thing is , you can use the screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s data is an image . 
this is what he dickens &quot; 荒凉 山庄 line , &quot; is chapter of content . 
i gave you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be a reading an electronic book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 is a picture of the opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , reading , people will get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in this a &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you just see the ad higher resolution versions of the picture , into the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can see other version , even technology dimensions . 
the way to an extent , averted the actual use body size . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and this information . 
obviously , with this technology , with digital maps , of course , it &apos;s one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field of our contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , let me put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually combined the two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from the university of washington graduate noah snavely undertake computer vision research findings . it &apos;s got at the university of washington steve seitz 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got application , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to do with multiple ways of looking at , and to do with subtlety 剖析 and have a lot of the resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping environment . 
there are many more examples of this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , going to take care of legal issues . 
these are all from flickr by this image , in space , being 串联 up . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : in fact , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
this is really quite amazing , welcome to . 
i think you can see these images from the many different camera , from a cell phone camera into a single professional backwards . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment are put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 pictures , etc . 
i remember this should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to the poster to see the rebuilding of the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can work to use the internet community . we can start to get everybody . everybody for different environmental memory to collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , all the secondary out to be much more than just collect at all . 
this is a model , however , is the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
their pictures , be 注 tag on you . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years will come from the 接合 pictures together ? 
yeah . the software is really , is to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this 接合 process is completely based on images of content . 
more exciting images that contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you go online and in that picture , the key word later , the web to have a lot of text with this picture , the relevant information . 
now , if you &apos;re all these pictures and images being , that would be like ? 
now , so the semantic information to each other inside of links , and is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s unbelievable . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about this book of content hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a the standard principles about it . 
like the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western 笃信 疑 industrial society is not a principles . 
well , this is to say , if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to get people to be free to maximize . 
why is it that freedom with itself is good and valuable , for people to do . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can 做主 ourselves with all the way the big enough to get welfare , people don &apos;t have to work for me were 做主 . 
and the freedom to do a lot to do is on the largest increase selective . 
people more choices , freedom is more and more freedom , and you get welfare is more . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that deep-rooted that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives , yet . 
let me give you some examples of modern society &apos;s advance development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my near a supermarket . not very much . 
i just wanted to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one to store it a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a one shop three-dimensional sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
in the store components that you can have a close 650万种 different combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a bunch of choice . 
in a business , i &apos;m talking about communication . 
i was a kid was , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , it &apos;s time to the dead are not bad . 
when that are 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially cell phones . now , that cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
and i &apos;d 津津乐道 is the middle -- that will take mp three the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t on your right next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , it doesn &apos;t take long , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store , and you ask : is there a without so much function ? &quot; 
you think , is to say ? 
answer is no ” “ . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things phone . 
again , in the lives of more than any other shopping for us to affect the things that have the same up there . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , who straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail solutions are very and risk . 
and so forth 乙 solutions are very and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
they said , again , a nail these things and risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you take that ” ? 
they said , &quot; “ , but i don &apos;t you ” . 
now the prescription drugs ads , is over to the ordinary people with you and me . if you think about it , is to say , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why should we do to promote market ? 
they want to answer is , we looked at the morning after ads would go to your doctor on the phone , and they put the prescription drugs put into them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide to show it . 
now we gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by ourselves to invent . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you today , you &apos;re going to do a kind of people -- men and women -- decide . 
in the marriage of families in the past everybody got married , it &apos;s almost like age , of course , and that is 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices and who is getting married , rather than when you see , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and today , about everything that can take 挑拣 拣 pick . 
i teach a bunch of smart bright students , but now i give them all placed homework time less than one fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they and their than ever before -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not and who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always asking myself , i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is it going right now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still not all placed do my homework , whether they in my class to take what an achievement . 
they really need to think about this problem , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can day at any time , in any one of the work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this restaurant , where you can actually have a wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you are . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible free choice for us is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , to work for themselves now is to break hanging around . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 with all the mobile phone , another 裤兜 installed in with their blackberry blackberry . it &apos;s lap , and with the laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at in 场上 rivals for children and kept asking myself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
don &apos;t go back to the email ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this an 信稿 ? 
if you give their answer was no , you have children and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whatever . it &apos;s a piece of cake , things were lifestyle terms , life is choice . 
we live in the world is this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world is this . 
the question is , what &apos;s a good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people who are affected , and these are two negative impact . 
first of all , it says something paradox , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us not liberating , but inside , is paralysis . 
with so many choices that people to decide , very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a about pension plan for investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to vanguard investment record . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office places . 
she survey found is that these people and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is about two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than you provide 5种 foundation , down 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , preferably tomorrow &apos;s , of course , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to a lot of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , the more likely to have the results were numb rigid . 
it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make that decision is right , right ? 
where do you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation , or is it salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
more choices , just as easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make decisions . 
secondly , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today , dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice can think about it , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you pick up a fascinating aspect . and that makes you always chosen to you that feel 美中不足 . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is now , you should think about that . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
it can be better than that ? it &apos;s now are thinking “ huh , really bad , ” “ is now in august , ” . 
“ manhattan neighbors don &apos;t ” at home . 
i &apos;m going to be “ back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost percent better chance in the parking . 
“ ” opportunity cost has enabled us to have to make a decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in that it &apos;s more , and all these things became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also say the “ ” now live in this idea . it &apos;s including things to do step by step . 
but , of a truth is , when you chose to do something , you and you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other things tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time , i went to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long , long enough to wash over a million times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , in this pants for many years old , i finally 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , and it &apos;s 宽松 for ? 
the first to 扣子 and pull locked ? 石磨 , or is wash ? 
you just a quick them ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i said , “ to me that was the only kind of pattern ” . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i can take a me the most 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is because there are so many can choose for a sex , my jeans what should have good to be a good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i didn &apos;t expect that much . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , better at least a 极致 is perfect . 
it &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i want to do , and i expect more than up , and it &apos;s just become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond doesn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize and less happy , even though it &apos;s a good results . 
there &apos;s nobody to market to understand this , because if they sense . there &apos;s people understand it , you don &apos;t have the opportunity to know what is this idea . i mean it . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in all these things are bad past , everything is better than now . 
and the reason why is that when a where things are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every one of the things you can only hope than you would expect , it &apos;s not bad . 
you will never be what was amazing , because you my than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , which is you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so thank you . i want to talk about ourselves a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t make excuses that might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be good , and they were so disappointed -- to decide , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world and the developed world -- clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but i don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
i remind you . 
and that choice and happiness -- the standard principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we choose the richest ‘ ’ needs the critical value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that has so much choice , is a huge abundance of matter . 
and the world and places , at least , we heard a couple of questions , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern western societies on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday said , amazing 气愤 question is , we produce the expensive and very difficult to operate the car seats 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is the expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really bring us harm . 
they actually makes us from than before . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and improve practice . 
products redistribution will allow all , it &apos;s not just the poor , living good , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess choice . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in this fish in everything is ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you &apos;ve added is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs “ ” this fish . 
in this fish and -- you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but there &apos;s a symbolic fish , which means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to figure out the code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life ” “ , i think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from a biological mimic analysis entered the world , the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to question , if we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , and mycoplasma genitalium . and it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 gene 一百组 separate out in front of us that these . 
so , we can continue to research that the only way is the synthetic chromosomes , so we can change its components to continue to question the basic problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to build this , we never make a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way down , just some live without sexual chemistry . 
our digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it still growing . we recently is going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
in fact , it took me through the stages . when we did the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world &apos;s 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline process , long time , i made a mistake that much more . 
so we had to create a new way to make these little snippet emissions together and it all wrong . 
this is our first try phi x 174 , from the genome and bacteriophage -- to digital information . 
it &apos;s a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 symbol of dna . 
the most exciting stage is when we put this video there live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , the bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli and 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some of the oil industry , and i think they communicate with this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this is actually software can in a biological systems built in their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that this digital information must be very accurate . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , right , gene sequencing standard is every 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , in sequence again , the average is about 30 mistakes . and if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of a piece of design 50 character and the other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units of time . we need to design that they can together . 
we have a design of the unique part . 
you may have heard of , and we added 水印 . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 the body -- and these scripts 编成 about 20 amino acids amino acids , and this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and you can use to cut enzyme 裁 . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , 7000 character from the length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character and the length of time to time 几组 merger , 72 people into a long time . 
in each stage , we produce a lot of the time , so we can give them -- because we wanted to create a very reliable process a minute , you &apos;ll see 
we try to get an automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece of 7,000 over 100 , basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for a long , and try to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example that &apos;s a little radiation 球菌 can withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original . 
we have 千种 can do with this . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is the mentioned yeast way and put it right , we design pieces . yeast automatically aggregates them . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
this is a long time about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is a symbol than 580000 genetic code . this is by humans setting structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface , no distance , it will print out . it takes 142页 to print the genetic code 
so how do we launched a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple process a bacterium is more complicated . 
with like us this is a relatively simple biology , and you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole list of the chromosome from one cell move on to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we try to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve all had a second chromosomes species or from other parts of the third side chromosomes , in a second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution , and it would have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit enzymes is to digest dna . 
the original cells have this enzyme without this enzyme when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the other one is no matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a has a new dna . 
we put in gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original species feature all disappeared , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , in fact , is that we put into it . 
it may sound like 炼金术 genes , but we did get through dna , to move to dramatically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of a life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world becomes three people compared to every single one of us from 1946 is people ; in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , all the fuel , very difficult . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this biological process or any can replace it program , it &apos;s a big challenge . 
and then , of course , is that the material that was the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world that had a contains about 两千万组 gene database , and i like to see them as the design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to kind of components , so let &apos;s get diversity . 
now , our main limit from reality biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because they can make we call the mixing of “ ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can start to survive , to choose , chemical production , or fuel vaccine manufacturing , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit at work in the computer to really design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 ” fuel . 
you just saw corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it was sugar into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months to get our first 第四代 fuel . 
and the co2 is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we &apos;ve found in the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep , about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
if we look at the two to collect what &apos;s really , really convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase the &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have replace the oil industry 化工 little target . so -- so if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we &apos;re using the tools to create a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see in this case , we tend to slow down on a year and lack of money in situations they really useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine for change . 
this is the future might present situation with change , now , evolutionary tree , with synthetic 古物 of bacteria , and it &apos;s a biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 ted u short of the presentation , brian cox : which shares some super 对撞机 news . the content , including are now to repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to update reality machine is running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use it for a big bang some camera detector . 
this is what i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first picture clusters particles along the way around the lhc . we &apos;re planning , as part of the lhc . and , in a lot of particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know this is getting 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people go to google , saw that graph front page . 
this suggests that we work with this as a culture of it as a scientific shock . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the main 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they machine on . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do , because when it very low , they became superconducting 导线 
so in minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between the circumstances these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises that it is a little bit of a sudden they transmission 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
must 卸 them down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now , waiting for them back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , get data and continue our mission to figure out the most basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still in my pursuit of the fact is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you . 
elizabeth gilbert , about creativity and create 呵护 reduce stress . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event , however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and no matter where i , people think this is the result is that life , and no matter where i , people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , not saved playing 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very depression , came to me and said , &quot; you don &apos;t “ ? not afraid that you &apos;re afraid of my life is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people ! 
i was around in the same question , people say , you &apos;re afraid never succeed ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair , filled with die in a failed 苦痛 i was always get to that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
well , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know that . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , speaking of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear writing ? but , speaking of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear writing ? 
this is a better idea ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? 
nobody says “ john , do chemistry in bottleneck ? how ” ? 
never would ask this happened . 
and of course , 平心而论 chemical engineers , it &apos;s a group , not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of a century , the field with great wizards 英年早逝 case just look at the early years of a century , the field with great wizards 英年早逝 case is often older lightly died since . 
if the suicide , no , it &apos;s not completely shows their talent , even though they don &apos;t suicidal , it &apos;s not completely shows their brilliance 
and the 曼梅 le , died in the last interview said “ each one of my books are 蚕食 ” part of me . 
in your life &apos;s work , this is a radical statement . 
today i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
you think this sentiment ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of a 臆断 even further away at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 
this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative genius , they continue to be alive . 
and i myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 and myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , especially in my career at stage , especially in my career so far . 
you see , i was young , i just for 40 years old , you know , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for life . 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say , is in my heart , and it &apos;s very possible , and i &apos;ve ever been the most successful . 
oh my god , this is what idea . 
is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , is this idea , so people took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance away from the writing , and i work for extreme anxiety open outcry from the writing , and i work for responses extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please bear with me , because eventually be sent back to our problems . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred djinn tense from distant and you know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know , from distant and purpose is to know where the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creativity djinn to for “ 守护神 ” 
and for people to think socrates is such a 守护神 , from a distance , he was giving people to think that general wisdom socrates is such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius djinn called “ ” ancient rome people with the same ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this is wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 individuals . 
this is a view , this is what i &apos;m looking at this safe distance , and that &apos;s what makes people from work 成败 impact psychological protection . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
the artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass “ ” geniuses work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you &apos;re really bad ” “ genius 
this is in the western for a long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , which is too big . 
it completely twisted people a sense of cognitive and for people to make an incredibly expand expect it completely straight up twisted , one of our self , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists to kill , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists together . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think this is that our question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 out of the reason we don &apos;t mind with a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 off developed 500多年 better human . 
maybe i can convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , and no one had ever tried to make us believe in you &apos;ve all had to sit on this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath really and the next to her . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is the power to 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is the power to 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
and now , she can be the only thing with her words , is to “ 死命 狂奔 ” 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : at some point , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail 顺势 out , put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 顺势 out , put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to represent on paper order , it &apos;s upside down , from the beginning of the word , and go , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like , crazy , and i , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 like me , and also inadvertently get incredible idea , but even 古板 , and as i was going to get an accident . 
there &apos;s many of you may have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have don &apos;t know where inspiration , and you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have don &apos;t know where inspiration comes . 
this is exactly what happened ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it &apos;s not going to losing rational ? we &apos;re going to see how it &apos;s not going to losing rational ?

since that event later , tom &apos;s change the creative process . 
it doesn &apos;t work , he &apos;s still the dark , we &apos;re still onto something . 
for inspiration can is his and the external unknown between being weird , wonderful and strange relationship creative inspiration can is his and the external unknown between being weird , wonderful and strange relationship that &apos;s a beyond ourselves .

it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s completely shit , i began to think i should give up to write this book . 
it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s completely shit , i began to think i should give up to write this book .

i hope that history today : i 尽责 坚守 to my € jobs , i hope that history today : i 尽责 坚守 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , although rarely see , but actually happen at a dancer , going beyond present 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you have in a moment , have seen that . 
it seems to stop , dancers was across the time to stop , across the dancer was what he did before 1000场 action and do something different , but not everything was amazingly unified up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was the sacred shine . 
and people know exactly what it is , they can call out of its name was clearly , people know what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing wondrous for , people will 喝彩 “ : arturo la , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 -- oh , that really wonderful , wonderful , amazing ” that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up the most intractable for artists , the morning , dancers 悠悠 up on a tuesday morning , that &apos;s 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
and that &apos;s only when bad leg , and you &apos;re going to people , and he might last night , couldn &apos;t get that level . 
maybe no longer there will be in his dancing , 喝彩 god with him from good , there are going to do ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of our self . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most painful for my self , understanding of this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of our self . 
but perhaps , we were all suffering that if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , which dance . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , which dance . 
if not , it will continue dancing , 坚守 your jobs , and i still 喝彩 for you : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , it will continue dancing , 坚守 your jobs , and i still 喝彩 for you : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach the idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore here at ted global shows the new situation , climate trend that &apos;s worth more than scientists , and he worried that for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore and to climate trends . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about polar ice cap demo 三百万年 in the past , the size of south america by the equivalent of 48 state 缩减 40 percent of the area . 
but that doesn &apos;t really fully . this problem , because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
it feels like the polar ice cap -- just like a good global climate system beating heart 
the winter and summer 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is 冻 permanent ice 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue here is a year in the winter and summer ice 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or a longer the ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood 各部 guy in the body to move . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect around the arctic ocean 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon and 解冻 干冰 . it &apos;s methane , carbon compost . 
now , if the dots , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the lake in alaska in shallow water now you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
one reason , the boreal deposition a heat heating greenland . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it has to be better than traffic 往年 . 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land ice melts , sea levels rising and how to make it 入海口 . 
there are 急速 traffic . 
the other side of the earth , the largest ice on the planet . 
last month , scientists report the continents are in decline of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet and greenland . 
in the himalayas and the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
the global financial water from 40 to 50 percent of water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
the dry that are causing fires in numbers . 
and the world &apos;s population are disasters in absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years time period , 总数 reached earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we every increase 七千万吨 co2 emissions from the ocean 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of the big reasons , except for 20 percent of the destruction , forest is burning fossil fuels . 
oil and coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big one country emissions , and china . 
the solution was to build a use more coal carbon planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth , in my hometown of tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
maybe you see on the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
this is a coal carbon industry . 
coal and cool is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive , and he helped us economic development . 
coal and cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
this is west virginia , a lot of coal waste 产地 
the biggest is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and now one of the work of two projects . 
this is one part of that one . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to set our initial goal explaining coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , coal , not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , don &apos;t worry about it for global warming . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plant . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , the main reasons here you can see the clean coal fascinated exciting technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , the climate crisis . 
will the crisis is strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products on like dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve the problem of projects . 
america repower with 100 percent renewable electricity use a time . 
so , the american new job for us to live better security , and it &apos;s not in the warming . 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
repower america , about more . 
the last one . 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old dirty oil and murder of our planet , which is , let &apos;s cut to rely on the fastest way . 
here &apos;s the wind and solar power , and new energy network . 
new investment to create more money huge . 
repower america . it &apos;s time to dream well . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember that you &apos;re in the age of being a kid with a kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re thinking and learning how to solve problems . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that 空间结构 really helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
and that question would be in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so we have this infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable with a computer , it &apos;s like a cookie size . 
you can bring siftables hand moves , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
the tools that are independent , more sensitive to each other , with all its senses , mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows images in here , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe , then images in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a 挨 a out ok , interesting is going to happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that will have a mess . 
they can perceive moves each other and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction through some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that down the colors , from a siftable into another piece siftable . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put these barrel into color in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it more , can you go back a few . 
siftables and learning machine function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , faster at it . 
and i &apos;m here to show siftables reason -- and applause . this is a simple equation , i use a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
this &quot; play games together as a way down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together to make words , siftables in the dictionary automatically find words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word sequence and change the spell that letter , make the right word , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so -- thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , that &apos;s some kids are in the media lab because in the test siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , playing the game together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , and this is a “ together words ” game , they know how to do this . 
now i have on the screen other people in siftables experience . 
the right-hand corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now i have on the screen a animation function interact try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the children &apos;s felix . 
he can put some new add elements to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animated graphics vote image , you can bring these new element to put it on . 
see , he put up to the sun . 
the sun liters up . 
david and he put tractors add up . 
orange tractors . 
do good . 
and to shake siftables animation images that can bring new add elements to this on his new element to add up -- 吠 dogs . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he &apos;s planning to develop stories plot . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables function that into sound domain , can make like 超载 sounds and bess and drum voice . 
and there &apos;s tiles 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into siftable by the way you like . 
voice , just to put sound to edit tiles module . 
there &apos;s this 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
put this kind of come close to sound tiles can adjust the sound . 
so , we can use to control and rhythm and volume siftable tiles near the end of the modules siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the 超载 into the two tiles , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles drums modules , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to accelerated pace of just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now let &apos;s put a voice to the tiles shellfish tiles sound filter . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so you don &apos;t need to have 编排 playing in real time , but when they play , but for a short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so -- thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
