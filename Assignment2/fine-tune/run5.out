and through pictures rapture purpose and national geographic explorers of stories , by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these culture is an alarming rate disappear from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same kind of adaptability rules . 
we are born into 母腹 and in the world 生儿育女 
we &apos;re going through an adult sculpted by millennia girl . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and dance has unique signature rhythm . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send the different perspectives will let you see hope 
this world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture and intertwined life into internet cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important purpose as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is the human race circle the great heritage . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also a strong as we have the ability to look at the logo . 
as biosphere by severe erodes the same race circles are facing the same shorter and its destruction faster 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet have used 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is shining human spirit . 
it &apos;s all solid mental unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds and spirit ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and our audience in the same amount of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no meaning 传人 unless we valid solutions , they will completely disappeared . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be talking final 本族语 who couldn &apos;t tell ancestors wisdom also not allowed to predict the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
another spooky turns on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an ancient language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore this race loop loop race to give you a rough and understand what makes you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people already forgot . i said “ different way of living in front of me ” said “ ” different ways to survive . 
for example this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 bacillus la played methuselah areas that they &apos;re called the 蚺 race because they believe in a time where they came from the sacred river 米尔克 东岸 used for the snake . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 jungle , so they &apos;re concerned with 天穹 forest canopy no difference . 
they say , with a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that as a linguistics 异族 通婚 people have played with a different languages , married people . 
this is the mythology of historical lineage down , you can see a strange phenomenon because of the same 异族 婚 often have a reason 大家族 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
i once in contact with many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 them is the most amazing part of the genocide in 1958 years earlier , i used to that they had peace friendly . 
five year 1957 missionary trying to get them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the sky eight to 10 pictures they 十张 himself in our opinion that &apos;s friendly means , but they don &apos;t think that live in 雨林中 who &apos;ve never seen a two-dimensional picture . 
they pick up from the forest these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people person , but they found nothing and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 this missionary five died . 
more terror is not only 华拉尼 戮 external people died . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent mortality population was their 戮 dead people . 
we have to 一个八代 宗谱 survey found only 两例 our natural death 刨根问底 they finally goes out to the truth will work devastation 年迈 wood , they will die 戮 his 送终 for him . 
in addition to the forest , they have astonishing 惊诧 perspective . 
their predator can smell 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is animals urine . 
in order to understand the mysteries i have to figure out this amazing religious teaching voodoo how thing voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
this is very interesting . 
if i want you to list some important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
voodoo individual beauty in it was born with the connection between them . 
the harbor life soul . 
and dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 to 大水 below soul temporarily replace born makers soul in this brief moment shining for 侍僧成 god . 
so voodoo believers likes to say you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re cathedral to dance . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . how would get hurt ? 
i was exposed to all of those groups in colombia life in the mountains of santa 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient civilizations tyranny of descent , they were once conquered and filled out the caribbean columbia coast in plain 此后 them back to the coast plains of an isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent this race has never been spaniard conquered . 
and today , they get along with 续 monk would rule institutions , but they monk 训诫 very unique . 
as they return to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain these values and believers relationship with the universe we can call it the ecology of balanced . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect its beauty . 
they call themselves as we call 兄长 for 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous would not 多愁善感 wouldn &apos;t tolerate 思乡 of torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for meaning illustrates people &apos;s relationship with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia , up by local people affected my mind that forest is going to be logging . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this picture are me this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often used it did die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent of color is its components and brain five -- 羟 color is 成份 very close . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribal person would contain from five 羟 color is plants extract this material and use his snout took crack 
if you use nose sucked into powder that you will see 光怪陆离 hallucinations in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distort it were totally wiped out 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organ in a single called is 氧化酶 enzyme activity change . 
to oral these color is matter have must also oral change is a single 氧化酶 living as any chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that in there -- β 藤本植物 咔 啉 can inhibit actually is a single 氧化酶 and play the color is so potent you 不由得 to ask myself . 
when we do all kinds of experiments constantly measure outcomes are wrong 
but if you ask indians , they &apos;ll say plants will speak . 
what does that mean ? 
tribes 科凡 who found 17 species die cane is all they &apos;re found in the deep jungle we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not necessarily about plants are said to me is not understand . 
so i told you , if they said in the night 17 months round things that grow every plant would have different little word singing to you . 
this discovery is not going to get your ph.d. from harvard , but it &apos;s much more accounting 报表 more fun 
dh : now we have a problem that although our compassion in some tragedy indigenous people think they live 离群索居 丰富多彩 world forward , but as we develop these people go to the edge of status in history . 
and all cultures have been threatened by new lifestyle strongly shock 
this is not technology itself . 
sue mobs indians even down 弓箭 still is a great sioux nation indians and americans say goodbye 骑马 and sit 马车 life was still americans . 
the threat ethnic circles 完整性 is not change or technological innovation itself , but power is barbaria up his ideas . 
let &apos;s look at the mountains tibet recently where i made a lot of research , where you &apos;ll see authoritarian political oppression brutal . 
although genocide in the world are consistent denounce genocide cultural destruction , but it &apos;s destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce in many places it even considered by part of this strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet withstand 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
chinese invasion immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 families and 成份 by 关押 . 
he was still there are only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister offend by into 学习班 and behavior . 
one day she accidentally hit the mark of the fur &apos;s head and 臂章 is to be guilty of countries accept seven 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to withstand human redemption mental need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need an 五彩缤纷 diversity , the world . 
back up , we have in the world exist in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 age revolution human to go to the top of the agricultural age we seed girl erotic 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra for cheese 祭 after we created a level of into this 社会分工 only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to let us have the ability to solve the millennium facing challenges . 
when we tell the world &apos;s cultures asking meaningful life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in the songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to realize that we must all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this photo was me in northern 巴芬岛 on the top , and then i made some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people tell me a talks about his grandfather legendary story . 
in the 1950s canada government is not always practice inuit people to build our national sovereignty we put them into away by designated 定居点 . 
this is the old man refused to move . 
his family worried that his security put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , this is their days alone thick advantage . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 package of fish 冻 made of . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he slept outside wearing his skin his 长裤 stool seal to pull in hand when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into shape blades . 
and then put it in this shit blades puke on the edge and 口水 frozen after it becomes very robust after he used it to 刀子 宰杀 dog . 
next 剥 dogs bark into a 挽具 his chest and take the dog sleds condom made to other dog between when you don &apos;t put it on a shit knife in ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways dh : these are inuit all indigenous people around the world of real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 canada government to an area than in texas and california &apos;s 之和 large area of land returned back to inuit people . 
i was our new home its name le new dimension , 
this is a separate territories they control where all the marine resources . 
this is very good example to demonstrate a country can do something with it managed to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , i think for ever this world some remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent branch of human imagination dates back to the ancient origins period for all of our people , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think jt debate is not to convince people , but we think about it and get to make the world , so we could change the world &apos;s good at talking about facts institutions our website month click amount as three to five thousands 百万次 
our 156 channels in a play countries . 
our magazine have millions of people . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the ran this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from online picky . using a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of scenes , and can navigate them . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is many many gb &#91; 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can make sustainability and smooth zoom in , can mapping browse them by the way , you can do to rearrange them . 
no matter how data can see , there &apos;s a lot of pictures and images themselves , how big seadragon has this processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference because limit system performance only factor is just : you can use the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of data . 
this is what he called &quot; dickens 荒凉 , &quot; 山庄 line is chapter content . 
i gave you prove that this is really not text and images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 is a picture of the opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , when people get better reading experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in the issues to &quot; the guardian &quot; corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture ads -- that you see longer than average ad to a high resolution , embedded in pictures of the extra content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
the way to an extent averted screen actual use area limits . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary played out the window and things like garbage information . 
obviously , technology applications for this map is , number one obvious applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made this field for your contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , let me put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology already online , you can experience yourself to it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually combined the two different techniques . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from graduate school at the university of washington noah snavely undertake computer visual research findings . and this study got washington university steve seitz 
and microsoft institute rick szeliski help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got applied , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to have multiple ways of looking at pictures and images to make the subtlety 剖析 and have more resolution browse experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there are many examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , going to take care of legal issues . 
these are all from flickr photos , by this 串联 up by in space . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would end to work for microsoft 
by this welcome , really quite amazing happy . 
i think you can see these images from the original many different camera phones : from the camera into a single professional backwards . so a lot of different quality images , by all in this environment work together . 
let me get some relatively mysterious images . 
see , some pictures visitors 大头 contains the pictures , etc . 
i remember this should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can use effectively online community with everyone . we can get data to everybody for different environments memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , all the secondary out to all gather much more than just up . 
this model can secondary out , is the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people would use and become increasingly complex , become more valuable . 
user picture , you will be 注 tag on . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the years to global images from 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software that was really significant to explore . 
it builds up in pictures of hypertext . 
this process is entirely 接合 images based on the content . 
more exciting images that contains a lot of text information semantic . 
for example , you go online and with that picture , the key word later , page text to contain huge picture with this relevant information . 
now , suppose you all these pictures and images being , that would be like ? 
now , so these semantic information links each other and the capacity to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible congratulate ! you did . 
thank you very much ! 
barry 施瓦茨 : the choice of confusion . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about this book of content hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i think from a recognized the creed of going up . 
like the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 疑 笃信 creed . 
this is faith say this : if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is this stuff in freedom from itself is good and valuable , for people are essential . 
and once people had freedom , each of us can themselves with 做主 way of the big enough to get welfare , people don &apos;t have to work for me were 做主 . 
and the freedom to achieve great approach is the largest increase selective limits . 
people more choices , which is more freedom , freedom , getting more and more that welfare . 
i think , this concept like 掺 into the water that gave us the age-old that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples of modern society at the progress of development gives us become possible to do anything . 
this is my near a supermarket . not very big . 
i just wanted to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , it &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one to store it a three-dimensional stereo system -- voice box conclusion , cd machine conclusion , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
using this store components that you can make various 650万种 closer together with the three-dimensional stereo system . 
you can &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a different industries , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer telephone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , the telephone is going to die will not all bad . 
that already 一去不返 days . 
now we &apos;re nearly there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially mobile . yuyu shows cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
one of my most 津津乐道 is that the infant -- with three mp play machine , nose cutting hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen anything , don &apos;t worry , with no pretty soon , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store , and you ask : is there a without so much function ? &quot; 
you want , answer would be ? 
answer is no “ ” . 
now you &apos;ve probably not buy a not so many things stem cell phone . 
similarly , living in some other shopping for more than we produce impact on this thing , the same choice bang existed . 
healthcare -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , doctors straightforward tells you how to do era . 
instead , you get a doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments nail , can also use 乙 solutions . 
and so forth solution nail has happened with risk . 
and so forth solution 乙 had happened and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , i should do ” how ? 
the psychiatrist says again , a nail these treatments , and risk 乙 have those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for you and me . the ordinary people , if you think about it , don &apos;t say , if we can &apos;t think a directly to buy 柜台 . 
why are we doing to their marketing campaign ? 
answer is , they wanted us to look after the ad morning will go to your doctor , call to let the doctors prescription drugs on their change it . 
now as our gender identity that kind of thing became choice topic . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now we are not gender inherited from my parents down there , but by themselves to invent . 
so we can go back to what have you shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do a what people are women and men &#91; the &#93; decide . 
in marriage family ways , in the past everybody got married , it &apos;s almost like age natural thing , and was soon 生儿育女 . 
you need only choice is and who are not married , and when you see , it &apos;s not married , after doing . 
and today , about everything that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart bright students , but now i give them all placed homework fifth time less than one . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever students -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so who . 
the reason is now their brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask yourself : i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is it going right now ? 
and after that ? i &apos;m trying to go to a child , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still not doing my homework all placed , whether they also in my class to take a what grades . 
they really should go to these questions , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technological progress that we can in any one time , on the earth in a corner work -- of course it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this hotel where you can actually have a wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible chose liberal bring us is we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for myself to task was to break hanging around . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 installed in the phone , another 裤兜 installed in with their blackberry &#91; knee &#93; blackberry , or with a laptop . 
even though they were locked up , we are looking at in 场上 rivals for children and constantly ask myself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to this email or not ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this sealed 信稿 ? 
if you give their answer is no , you have children and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether thing was , small things matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we used to live in the world is this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not everybody needs 事事 choice . 
and today we live in the world are like this . 
the question is , what is good news or bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people have two impact , two and a negative impact . 
one , some say up , which is an oxymoron , &#91; choose &#93; bring us is not liberating , but box , is paralysis . 
with so many choices that people want to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a story about peer-to-peer pension plan investment ways to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to vanguard investment record . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about two million people , and office 000多个 place . 
she survey found is that when these customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every species increases 10 to reduce the number is about two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 fund , people than you provide 5种 fund , 10 percent decline . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to choose to decide that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , preferably tomorrow &apos;s , of course , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
don &apos;t join this peer-to-peer plan , they make a lot about the 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 . 溜掉 employer was very dedicated to provide these subsidies . 
so , choices , possibilities too many results were numb rigid . 
it makes us into the world looks like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you enter 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make that decision is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where do you really don &apos;t want to choose wrong co-op fund , or is salad ingredients . 
there are several reasons . 
the more choices , just as easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make decisions . 
secondly , is what economists call “ opportunity cost ” things . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have many options consider , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you quit to attract people aspect . and that makes you always chosen to you that feel 美中不足 . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , if i take a 歉 . 
but this is what you should think right now . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
expensive rich zone . 
gorgeous beach , sunlight 明媚 , they have all this . 
you can still better than that ? it &apos;s now without thinking “ huh , really , poor ” “ now is , in august ” . 
manhattan “ neighbors were not home , ” 
i &apos;m going to “ is back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was such an idea torture , with every day in 念叨 lost percent better chance in the parking . 
“ opportunity cost ” always has enabled us to make a decision not even with these decisions are actually 英明 . 
we have options more attractive in these options that are more , and all these things became opportunity cost . 
here &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problems . 
it also says out in the present whatsoever “ ” this principle . maybe even include things to do step by step . 
but , of a truth is , when you chose to do something , and then you have chosen not to do other things . 
these other things tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this point in time , i have to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to wash over a million times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , this wearing pants for many years old , i finally 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
counter said , you &apos;re 紧身 type , comfort type , was 宽松 type ? 
to the front 扣子 and pull locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
going that fast grind breaking ? 
and the mouth , is still a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw nearly fall down . i have to wait 缓 god , i said , i &apos;m going to “ that was the only kind of ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i &apos;m wearing a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is , because there are so many can choose for a sex , my jeans what should have much better to be greatly good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a while , i didn &apos;t expect a lot . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least the best one was 极致 perfect . 
and that &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i expect compare , and i expect than up , and it &apos;s just become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond doesn &apos;t give people delivered many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize results less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
market out there &apos;s nobody understood this principle . because if they understand people &apos;s inside of it , you don &apos;t have the opportunity to know what is this idea . i mean cartoons . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in all these things are bad past everything is better than today . 
and the reason is the one where things are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every object the more you will only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
you will never be what was amazing , because you my than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret to happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so -- so i want to talk about their smoking a bit of time , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my no 凑合 , i try . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans choices for you , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now obviously the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t make excuses that might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that decided to achieve results good they are still &#91; to &#93; disappointed , decided to blame myself . 
in the past our generation , in developed countries -- industrialized world now in clinical repressed disorder explosive growth . 
and the net effect is the objective , although we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this &#91; choose to bring happiness -- the standard principles , we all think is right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no doubt choose to better than no choice , but don &apos;t choose conclusion that more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we choose ‘ rich ’ needs the critical value . 
i say almost finished . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that has so much choice , is matter vastly rich . 
we have a lot of the world where , at least we heard a couple of questions , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern western societies on one particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we produced those expensive and very difficult to operate the car seats 于事无补 , just in waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is that these expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really bring us harm . 
they actually makes us from as never before . 
this is what economists call the 帕累 thomas improve practice . 
products redistribution will allow all people , not just the poor , living good , because we got rid of that as a plague affecting our excess choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in everything on this fish is ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting is when you read this . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increased was paralyzed , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs such a fish “ ” . 
and in this fish -- you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective : we &apos;re doing digital biology worked . and now we &apos;re trying to from those numbers code to a biological design new phase , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” i think many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from a biological mimic analysis world computer entered the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , whether we could build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , graph mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome can make it in the lab self-replication . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can start genetic 500组 in which we 一百组 separate out in front of these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study is these synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue to question these basic problem . 
so we started walking along the way down to our “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never succeeded overlarge of molecules ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , by the way down , just some topless live sexual chemicals . 
our digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it also accelerating . we recently , what &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
it actually after several stages . when we did the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , long time , i made a mistake is much more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these small snippet emissions together and righted all wrong . 
this is our first try from phi x 174 , &#91; of &#93; genome bacteriophage started digital information . 
that &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the most exciting period is when we put this video there live sexual chemicals put into a bacterium , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells releases virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli &#91; 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some oil industry , and i think they communicate this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so what we think this is actually in software can build a biological system within our own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that this digital information must be pretty accurate . 
when we first in 1995 , for this group , gene sequencing right is the standard per 10,000 for a fundamental mistake . 
in fact , we found in sequence again , when the average is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence , it probably never set of genes are turned on . 
design work is partly design 50 character length of time and other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units . we had to design before they get together . 
there we design some unique part . 
you may have heard in which we added 水印 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 of the body -- and these scripts 编成 for about 20 amino acids every these amino acids , there &apos;s a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
and initially , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we created these and fragmented can use to cut 裁 enzyme . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , from 7000 character length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character length of time and pull 几组 snippet merger , became 72 7,000 long time . 
at every stage , we grow a piece of these , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very large snippet over 100 , 7,000 for basic when they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil . for longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , using dna repair , it can put together piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation called microbes 球菌 can withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , its chromosomes nieces in various places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original form . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space that exists , life is moving around , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images , by the process , which is a front mentioned yeast way and put right after we design pieces . yeast automatically , will they aggregates . 
this is not electron microscope picture ; it merely average optics microscope . 
this is such a big molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
this is a long time about 六秒 images . 
this is what we open recent experiment results . 
this is more than 580000 character long gene code . this is by humans setting structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think it will not helvetica 10号 interval print it out . and you need to 142页 print the genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is a very simple process bacteria more complicated . 
processing like ourselves this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a tucked into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they &apos;re acting 连成 with the cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a transplant entire chromosomes to shift from one cell into another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process stop there . but we try to bring this process of design into some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we found all accepted second chromosomes species or from elsewhere third-party chromosomes , in a second increased 数千种 new feature to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception of biological ignoring the realities . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digest dna . 
the original cells chromosome without this enzyme without this enzyme when we have this enzyme putting into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it will its digest , finally , we have a new dna contains a cell . 
we put in gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original species feature all disappeared , and completely into a new species , based on our cells and put it in the new software “ ” . 
all the proteins are changed , also membrane changed -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is actually we implant it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we did get through dna , to transfer to radically change things . 
now , i want to say it &apos;s not invasive century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of big life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do this for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we put people in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world becomes three people compared to each of us from 1946 that exist ; people in the next 40 years , within four becomes . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
nine billion people to change that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this creature program or any can replace it program , it would be a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is this material in indicated by the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world that had a contains approximately 两千万组 gene database , and i like to call them as the design components . 
electric industry only 10 to grow components , let &apos;s get this diversity . 
now , our main limits from biology reality and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can make we call the mixing “ chromosome group ” quickly synthetic approach . 
we now have the ability to build a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is only criteria . we can choose to survive , the ability to choose , or chemical production vaccine manufacturing fuel , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit working with real in the computer to design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel , is sugar into higher value fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
sunlight and co2 is one way -- 
so now -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . in other ways . 
this is a microbial , by 1996 them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is its energy source . 
we &apos;re seeing is able to collect the two has really , really convenient , they can be introduced processing stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry 化工 little target . okay . now , if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we &apos;re using the tools to make this real-time 几组 vaccine . 
you &apos;ve seen this appeared flu , we tend to slow last year in time and money , lack of cases they really useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine for change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species 古物 bacteria , and it &apos;s nuclear and biological accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this ted 09年 u short of the presentation , brian cox shares some super which 对撞机 news . the content , including now are going to repair the history of our biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
over the last ted introduced me to speak on the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to update reality machine is running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
we use to reinvent the universe forming billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in underground 日内瓦 mechanical . 
we use these detectors for mini some camera big bang . 
this is my installation that machine , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas process of building magnificent scale , you can see huge . 
last september 10日 we first started this one machine . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first picture clusters particles along the way around the lhc . as we have to plan with the lhc . in large part of the detector go flying off 辐 particles . 
in other words , when we see here a in september 10号 spectacle we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people go to google , saw icons front page is this time 
this suggests that we work with this shock of the cultural and scientific impacts the big meaning . 
but about a week later , our machines out some major spook with these 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they started machine . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , those wires ” too narrow . 
they can do , because when it becomes very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so in minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between the temperature of these cases 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 on one mistake installed technology . 
so 导线 temperature rises that it is a little bit of a sudden they transmission 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnets damage . 
must 卸 them down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just waiting for them back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 refer to be the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , get data and continue our mission to find out that the universe , basic units . 
now , obviously , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think this mission too difficult still makes us with my pursuit of facts itself , which is where the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

you &apos;re afraid not sustained decline would take you click collapse ?

i need to somehow , establishing a safe distance away from writing itself , and i work for extreme anxiety open outcry from writing itself , and i work for responses extreme anxious . 
this one find eventually brought me into the greek and ancient rome 
so please patient hear me , because eventually be sent back to our problems . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred djinn tense from remote places , and you know , artist came around with a remote and no known purpose from remote places , and you know , artist came around with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creativity djinn tense for “ 守护神 ” 
people were prevalent to think socrates have such a 守护神 from a distance , he gave the popular and intelligent people thought socrates have such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him wisdom 
ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius “ djinn called ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius “ ” called djinn 
this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal . 
this is a view , this is what i was looking at this safe distance , this is what makes people from work 成败 impact psychological protect mechanism . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
artists ancient by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of genius “ ” help work done . 
if you work pretty crappy , also not all your fault . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is the westerners in the last very long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think that &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked to swallow 无异 from the sun , and the vulnerable individual , which is too big . 
this is a completely twisted people cognitive self , and has led to personal achievement incredibly expand expect it completely distort a human cognitive self , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years staving countless artist and i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think this is that our question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : are we going to do now ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off 抹杀 developed 500多年 rationality humanities ideas that we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off 抹杀 developed 500多年 rational human mind . 
maybe i can convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make us believe in you &apos;ve all had to sit on this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath , and really down at her . 
she could feel it arrives , because this is the power to her 撼动 feet into the ground .

in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : sometimes she said she almost shoulder 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail 顺势 la , put it back to the other hand , poetry on paper 誊写 顺势 la , put it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper , except sequence is upside down , from the last word , started by later forward , until the first words . 
i heard her story , after thinking : crazy , and my creative process identical ! of course it &apos;s not my creative process of all , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even as 古板 occasionally , i will also inadvertently get incredible inspiration , but even as 古板 occasionally , i will also inadvertently get incredible inspiration .

this is exactly what happened ?

since that event later , tom &apos;s changed the creative process . 
it &apos;s not work changed , and he &apos;s still work , we &apos;re still onto something in the dark .

in spain , when a performer done some amazing wondrous give , people will 喝彩 : arturo “ 欧 嘞 , la , la , 嘞 欧 arturo , really great , excellent , incredible ” that is good , there emerge . 
this way , good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most tricky was morning , dancer 悠悠 turn up for artists , for the most tricky was morning , dancer 悠悠 turn up that tuesday morning was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there emerge of god . 
and that &apos;s only when bad leg , older people are going to van , and maybe he couldn &apos;t get that last night altitude . 
perhaps on someone would never when he dancing 喝彩 god with him how good , there should be about ourselves ? 
this is a very tricky issues , it &apos;s creative process of one of the most painful cognitive self . 
this is a very tricky issues creative process , which is the most painful cognitive itself of this is a very tricky issues , it &apos;s creative process of one of the most painful cognitive self . 
but maybe we would have pain , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your best job ” that part . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your best job ” that part . 
in your 坚守 jobs , in whatever you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dance . 
in your 坚守 jobs , in whatever you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dance . 
if not , it will continue to dance , your 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , it will continue to dance , your 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach this one idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore on ted global shows the new situation , think climate trend worth more than scientists predictions about , and he says to “ clean coal ” gestures . 
for gore recently climate trend warning . 
last year i &apos;ll show you two about polar ice cap demo in the past 三百万年 by area in the equivalent of the american south 48 state area sum 缩减 40 percent . 
but they can &apos;t completely illustrate that question . because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s a good global climate system beating heart 
the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is a permanent ice 冻 
you see , it &apos;s moving into the dark blue is every winter annual ice formed in summer permanent ice 冻 contractions . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five or more long ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years , in it , from here to here . 
notice that allow the arctic ocean warming around 冻土 layer 受热 and there &apos;s lots of being 冻 sealed carbon &#91; when &#93; 干冰 解冻 microbes methane , carbon compost . 
if you break a roof , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the lake in alaska in shallow water now can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 went to a shallow lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
one reason , the boreal deposition a heat heating greenland . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it is going to be larger than 往年 
this is greenland southwest kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of how to make ice melts , sea levels rising here is its 入海口 
here are rise 急速 traffic . 
antarctica , the other end of this planet largest ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
global from 40 to 50 percent of its molten water drinkable water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , assuming is very serious . 
global dry that are causing fires population increasing dramatically 
and the world &apos;s population are disasters in quite unprecedentedly absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the past three decades , over time 总数 reached earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happened . 
in the past five years of our daily increasing co2 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 co2 emissions from the ocean . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west india times in the ocean 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce 
the biggest reason of the greenhouse effect , except forest destruction 20 percent is burning fossil fuels . 
oil and coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions of countries , and china . 
the solution is to build a use more carbon -- coal planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political war . 
and carbon -- coal and oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth , my home in tennessee digging billions of coal 淤泥 liters . 
you probably saw on the news 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
this is a before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of carbon -- coal industries . 
mr. coal cool is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see his fertile more productive , he also helped us economic development . 
cool coal mr. in every day to become more clean 
he cute , sanctuary for workers bring jobs . 
there is west virginia , a lot of coal waste 产地 
the biggest is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and one of the president now launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we treat climate change for our careers threat . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to set our initial goal and mining coal explaining the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , why don &apos;t worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as normal clean coal factory . 
some spectacular machine 喧哗 ! 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , the main reasons here you can see the clean coal fascinated exciting technology that changed everything . 
just look ! this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security challenges . 
america is in economic crisis , national security , climate crisis 
put all these crises strings together for us is based on carbon oil products on like dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solutions to solve these problems . 
america repower with 100 percent renewable electricity use a time . 
americans have new job access to our lives more safe , and let the earth is not warming . 
finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the last one . 
this is about repower america . 
the old dirty oil was murder our planet is that allow us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
just the wind and solar . here , a new network of energy . 
new investment to create more money there &apos;s lots of jobs . 
repower america . it &apos;s time to dream well . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first , i want you to remember about being a kid you in the era of played kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re thinking and learning how to solve problems . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that helps us very 空间结构 around for a lot of learning things . 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find answers , therefore the infant siftables . 
simply say , siftable is a computer , as you interact with a little big cookie . 
siftables could randomly moved by hand , 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , and siftable 每块 monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information tools of operation . 
this operation tools independent more and more sensitive to each other , cognition , perception any fine-grain mobile , so we can use this tool try something new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to demonstrate some simple . 
this is like 映 siftable allocation , if i put it to tilt side , so it &apos;s indicated in this picture is tilted , if i put it in the opposite direction , and then images tilted towards the opposite direction tilted . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a a 挨 out ok , interesting phenomenon will happen . 
if you give them a random , they would perceive , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves each other and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use siftables interact with gestures , like a liquid that put down from a color siftable into another piece siftable . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel set paint patterns of siftables , we can put these colors pour water in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it was , how can you go back a few . 
and siftables learning machine function , can be used to learn language , count arithmetic wait -- we want to use these functions , 快捷 learning to become more quickly see results . 
this is i &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- and applause . this is a simple equation i use a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix spell word games . 
this word playing games together as a way down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together to make words , it will siftables in lexicon automatically find words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell sequence change that shows the letters , make the right word , you can also try to use other letters to build new words . 
( applause . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because participation in the siftables test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that playing games together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them that this is a word puzzle ” “ together , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen on other people experience siftables . 
the right-hand corner this woman is age youngest people experience . 
he just wanted to siftables pile together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now i have on the screen a animation function interact try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
in this picture of child name felix . 
he can put some new add elements to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animated graphics vote video , you can bring these new element to put it on . 
see , he took the sun add up . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
orange tractors . 
do good ! 
take a shake in siftables animated graphics can bring new add elements to image on his new element to add up -- dogs 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open-source end of story , he &apos;s planning to develop stories plot . 
sitting balloon cat off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , this siftables function in terms of sound , can make like 超载 tone and bess and drum voice . 
everybody has come to regulate , but 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable by the way you like . 
join sound just put tiles close to sound editors module . 
there are similar 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles near sound modules can adjust the sound . 
so , we can use to control overall rhythm and volume of tiles siftable near the editor modules siftable to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the two tiles 超载 into edit , and then add some 超载 sounds . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now take filter acoustic tile near drums modules , it can adjust sound . 
let me put some accelerated pace simply put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now to put sound filter tiles shellfish near the tiles sound filter . 
music playing in the process , we can recreate 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have 编排 playing in real time , but when they play , but long and short . 
and finally , let me end with the play , near modules volume edited tiles , on the left with this appeared . 
( applause . thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want you to interact with the idea is we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change this world with innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
