through rapture images and stories , for national geographic exploration of by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same kind of adaptive . 
we are born in 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going through an adult girl sculpted by millennia . 
生离死别 cruel to face , so we need to sing and dance with 排遣 苦楚 life that we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way to live with different perspectives 人生观 and different ways . 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send the different perspectives will let you see hope . 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture life intertwined and into the internet is for the entire planet , it &apos;s very important point 芸芸众生 as we call the web of the biosphere . 
this is a great human races circles . 
it &apos;s our identity -- we are as a very strong , the ability to look at the species . 
in biosphere by severe around in circles are facing the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
and one of the most important is that language . 
in our lives on this planet that has 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is the human spirit shining 
and it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the physical world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a spiritual ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and the number of us as much in the language of half no longer to teach children . 
they had no language 传人 that unless we valid solutions , they will completely . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re a final say 本族语 . you can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our children are not allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
another part of the earth is in fact , about every two weeks , which would have a 仙逝 年长者 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore the race to the races circles and give you a rough knowledge and make you personally feel are die civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people who have already forgot , as i said earlier , different ways to “ ” . i mentioned ” “ different ways . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 northwest part of the sierra played methuselah 蚺 that they &apos;re called the race because they believe in a time where they came from the 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green , because they &apos;re in the jungle 栖身 , so they &apos;re in the forest canopy 天穹 with no difference . 
they say , with a weird language and follow a unique 通婚 rules 通婚 异族 linguistics called this with the people who need a different languages , married people . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i &apos;ve been exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had peace friendly . 
five years to missionary 1957 to them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they &apos;ve 十张 eight to leave the air , they &apos;ve shot in our mind , it &apos;s kind of that , but they don &apos;t think that live in 雨林中 who had never seen a two-dimensional . 
they pick up from the forest , these pictures and images , trying to get over to find this one person , but they found nothing . and they think this is a call to devil cards , and they use with spears and five missionary 戮 died . 
and it &apos;s not just the external 华拉尼 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent mortality population was their 戮 to die . 
we have to survey found only 一个八代 宗谱 两例 natural death 刨根问底 they finally , we have the same people 年迈 wood is going to do more , they will 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have astonishing for bush 惊诧 insights . 
their predator can smell 40 step , animals smell urine several hundred yards away , and they know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out what this amazing religion voodoo teach them how thing voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some major religions in the world will give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
voodoo of the unique about life , and it &apos;s the connection between 
in the living soul . 
and the rhythm of dance to be able to 翩翩起舞 大水 below soul just replace the birth of the soul in this brief moment shining 侍僧成 for god . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re in a cathedral to dance . 
you &apos;ve been household gods that we can also get hurt ? 
when i was exposed to all the groups of living in colombia 玛尔塔 the northern part of the most remarkable 科基人 . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization descent , they were once conquered and filled out the coast in plain columbia 此后 them back to the coast plains of an isolated . 
in this bloody ethnic 肆虐 continent that has never been the spaniards . 
and to today and 续 along with monk would rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like 母腹 back to those groups are taught the values of these values that maintain the cosmic the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful that you want to protect it . 
they call myself 弟兄 兄长 calls us to say that we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous will not 思乡 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is the mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s a symbol that means that the people &apos;s relationship with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia who grew up on the idea of the jungle , i think is going to be absolutely . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this picture are me this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia 徒 萨满教 plants to use it to make a dead on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain with five 羟 color is very close to 成份 . 
亚诺马 rice tribes are going on with five 羟 color is plants extract the nose took crack and use . 
if you use a sucked into the powder 光怪陆离 hallucinations , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distort it were totally wiped out 
but the color is matter that doesn &apos;t oral because they &apos;re going to be one of your body , one is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter , there is going to change and oral 氧化酶 living as any chemicals . 
and this is the 藤本植物 β exists -- you can actually 咔 啉 氧化酶 and is going to work with the color is 不由得 , so you ask themselves . 
when we do all kinds of experiments constantly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask indians , they would say that plants can speak . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes are found in the death of the cane is they &apos;re in deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to the plant hierarchy is how they say , i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants are not talking about me . 
so let me tell you , and they said , if you &apos;re in the circle months in the night , and that &apos;s growing every plant to use the different little singing to you . &quot; 
and that &apos;s not going to get at harvard ph.d. 报表 accounting than , but it is more fun . 
dh : now we have this question , and some of us that compassion indigenous tragedy 丰富多彩 离群索居 their lives , but over the world in moving forward , these people go to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been threatened by a new way of life as a strong . 
this is not technology . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is a great sioux nation indians and americans say goodbye 马车 骑马 and sat there is still lives in the united states . 
the threat ethnic 完整性 layer is not the transformative power , but technological innovation , or the line all he was barbaric . 
let &apos;s look at the tibetan of recently , where i did a study where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide cultural destruction , which is the destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce in many places , it could be considered by this part of the strategies . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of having tibet 
this young man of 班禅 喇嘛 皈依 father . 
the chinese immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers displacement in nepal . 
his mother , because it was 关押 成份 富农 family . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and 学习班 into being . 
one day she accidentally hit the mark of a hair 臂章 and be in the face of a nation guilty for seven 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to take the human spirit salvation to get witness 
and finally , we &apos;re going to be such a choice , we &apos;re trying to live in a world still need an 五彩缤纷 and diversity in the world . 
think about it , we have in the world is in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 for human into the age of agriculture , and he went to the top of the seed 腊 girl 萨满 poetry is the mantra for 祭 cheese , for the next level , and we created 社会分工 that only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
and i think this brief history have enough that we have to solve the challenges facing to the 
when we tell the world &apos;s cultures : the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in a song of that , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that every race , and all of the living creatures 昌盛 prosperity . 
in this photograph was taken in the northern 巴芬岛 when i and some of the inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 whale call that the person to my tells a story about the legacy of his grandfather . 
in the 1950s , canada , governments don &apos;t have to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make the 定居点 away by them . 
this is the old to move . 
his family was worried about security , put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you know , inuit people fear the cold , and this is god alone thick . 
they had a ski sled in north america caribou 冻 鹿皮 clad in a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and blizzard 凛冽 . 
he &apos;s slept outside wearing his seal leather 长裤 he put a stool pulling in hand when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and it was made out of manure on the edge of the blades puke 口水 when it &apos;s frozen and become very robust , and he did it take 刀子 宰杀 a dog . 
the dogs bark 剥 挽具 and then he made a dog made out of his dog sleds condoms to another , and then when you come from the knife made of manure on ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways dh : these are inuit people in the world for all indigenous 写照 real 顽强 resilience . 
1999 four months , the government to an area of texas and california than 之和 area of land back to the returned to the inuit people . 
i was our new home its name is new le dimensions , 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do something with it managed to repair the relationship between people . 
and i think for ever in the world , some remote people is not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent the human imagination distant dates back to the millions of times , for all of us , these kids dream with our children &apos;s dream is that the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic and tv can do is we believe and don &apos;t do . 
we think dh : try not to convince people , but we think , by talking about the fact that can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s at about the institution to our website , up to a click of thousands of three to five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have millions of people from 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos of this stunning conducted photosynth , this software can change the way we see digital images from the internet , used to pick up a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute the magic view , and you can navigate it . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is many many gb &#91; 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can do for , you can zoom in on smooth and mapping by the way they were able to go to rearrange them . 
and see how data images , and how much of the images , and how much seadragon , has these processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot the image , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , having 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference because our system , with only one thing only : you can use the screen like 素数 seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s the data is an image . 
this is what dickens had 荒凉 山庄 , &quot; the line is the topic of content . 
i &apos;ll give you prove that this is really text and an image , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , not a picture . 
maybe it would be a reading an electronic book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 here is one of the opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper , which contains the percentage of the images , reading , when people get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in the issues to &quot; the guardian &quot; corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture ads , you just saw -- this is the normal ads , in higher resolution versions of the images into the extra content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can see other version , even technology dimensions . 
the way to an extent , averted the actual use body size . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary played out the window and things like the information . 
obviously , with this technology with digital maps , and it &apos;s one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you about this area that we &apos;ve made their contributions . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , let me put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , that technology has online , people to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merge with two different techniques . 
one is seadragon , and the other lady is from the university of washington snavely noah graduate undertake computer vision research findings . it &apos;s got at the university of washington seitz steve 
and of microsoft &apos;s rick szeliski help . it &apos;s a beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got application , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to multiple ways of looking at taking pictures , and to do with the subtlety 剖析 and have more resolution through the experience . 
now , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there are many more examples of this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , to take care of the legal issues . 
these are all from flickr photos , by this by 串联 up in space . 
and then we can so easily , the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this welcome . it was very happy . 
i think you can see these images from the cameras , many different from a cell phone camera into a single backwards . so a lot of different quality images , in this environment was all put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 pictures , etc . 
i think there should be a series of photos -- well , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to look at the poster in their environment . 
the point here is that we can work to use online community with everyone . we can get the data to everybody for different environments that memory , collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , all the secondary out to be much more than just collect at all . 
this model is a crime , the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like stephen lawler &quot; virtual earth &quot; long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be very complicated , become more valuable . 
their images , are you 注 the labels . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , and the software is going to be in the next few years from the 接合 pictures together ? 
yeah . the software is really , is to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this is based on entirely 接合 process and content . 
even more exciting is that image contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you go online and do a picture , a button on the web , and that will have a lot of text with this picture relevant information . 
now , suppose that image with you a picture of it all together , it would be ? 
and so the semantic information to each other inside of links , and that will be huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
barry 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about some of the book , which hopefully it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i think , from one recognized the principles about it . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western 笃信 疑 industrial society is not a principles . 
well , this is to say , if we want to get people to get the benefits of big enough , the way is to get people to free to maximize . 
why is this thing with the freedom that good and valuable , for people are essential . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can 做主 yourself with the big enough to do all kinds of benefits , don &apos;t get people to work for me were 做主 . 
it has to be free to the way that is the largest increase selective limits . 
people more choices , freedom is more and more freedom , getting the benefits are more . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that age-old that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples of modern society &apos;s advance development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my near a supermarket . not very much . 
i just want to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one stores to it , a three-dimensional sound system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a one shop three-dimensional sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
with this store components that you can have 650万种 close out of the things pop-up sound system . 
you don &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a bunch of choice . 
in a business , i &apos;m talking about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer phone service , it &apos;s got to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s not going to die for . 
one day are 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re nearly there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially mobile . now , that cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
one of my most 津津乐道 is the middle , which will mp three play -- with a machine , cutting hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store seen anything , don &apos;t worry , with no pretty soon , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store to ask : what are you don &apos;t have a doesn &apos;t take these capabilities ? &quot; 
you want , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
“ answer is no ” . 
now you have been impossible to buy a don &apos;t do so many things phone . 
well , in some other lives more than shopping for us to affect the things that are the explosion of choice . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , who straightforward tells you how to do era . 
instead , you get to the doctor , where they would say to you : we can use cure nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail solutions are things with risk . 
and so forth 乙 solutions for things with risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
the psychiatrist says , again , these things are nail 乙 risk , and there are those things and risk . 
how are you going to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you take that ” ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now , the ad , over the prescription drugs , is that these people around you and me . if you think about it , is to say , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why are they doing marketing campaign to us ? 
answer is , they hoped that we see in the morning after ads would go to your doctor on the phone , and they take the prescription drugs , put into them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice , like this slide to show it . 
now , our gender , not from my parents were inherited down , but by ourselves to invent . 
so we could get back to what have you shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do a kind of people -- men and women -- make decisions . 
the marriage of families in the past everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is natural thing , and was soon 生儿育女 . 
the only thing you need to and who was getting married , rather than when you see , it &apos;s not married , after doing . 
and today , about everything that can take 拣 挑拣 picky . 
i teach a bunch of smart bright students , but now i gave them all placed homework fifth time less than one . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever before student -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not and who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things that are always asking myself , i &apos;m going to get married or not to marry ? is it going right now ? 
it &apos;s next ? i &apos;m trying to start to kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
this is a 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still didn &apos;t make me all placed homework , whether they in my class with a what grades . 
they really need to think about this problem , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technological progress in one day , we can make any time , in any one of the work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but this restaurant , in fact , there &apos;s a place to wifi , but i don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i wanted to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible chose liberal bring us what we need are choices make decisions , again , again , again , for ourselves and the job was to break hanging around . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 when the mobile phone , with all the 裤兜 another with their blackberry blackberry &#91; with &#93; , and the lap and laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the same 场上 rivals for children are constantly ask yourself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to the email or not ? should i shouldn &apos;t write this an 信稿 ? 
if you give your answer is no , you have children , and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whatever . it &apos;s a piece of cake , things were lifestyle terms , life is choice . 
we used to live in the world is like this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to do . 
and today we live in the world , it &apos;s like this . 
the question is , what is good news or bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know it &apos;s good . so let me tell you that bad beauty . 
all these choices for people who are affected , and these are two negative impact . 
first of all , it &apos;s kind of an oxymoron , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us not liberating , but inside is paralysis . 
with so many choices are going to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just an extraordinarily vivid example to illustrate this point , it &apos;s about a peer-to-peer pension plan investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to recorded vanguard investment , vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
her research , that &apos;s when the customers and their employees to provide the support of fund -- every up 10 to reduce the number is about two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , you give people more than 10 percent 5种 foundation , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to pick and choose to decide that it &apos;s even more difficult , so you can actually put tomorrow last . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , preferably tomorrow &apos;s , of course , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
don &apos;t join this peer-to-peer . how about a year , they make 5千元 对等 subsidies from the employer 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to the mountains . 
so , it &apos;s too many choices are numb rigid . 
it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision , right , right ? 
where you really don &apos;t want to choose something a foundation , or a salad ingredients . 
there are several reasons . 
more options and more easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make decisions . 
secondly , economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today , dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a choice to think , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you choose to give up the compelling ways , and that makes you always for you to think of the chosen 美中不足 . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but it &apos;s you right now to think about . 
look at the hamptons 口子 both . 
most of the rich . 
all of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
it can be better than that ? it &apos;s now are going uh-huh , really bad , “ ” “ ” , in august now . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home ” . 
i &apos;m going to be “ back to the car park in front of my own ” . 
and for two weeks , he was such an idea torture and 念叨 lost in every day of the parking , into the best chance . 
“ ” opportunity cost has allowed us to have any good enough to make that decision is actually a 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in that is more of these things , and it became the opportunity cost . 
here &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for . 
it &apos;s got to say “ ” now live in a sense , maybe there &apos;s one way to do things . 
but , in a sense is , when you chose to do something , you and you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing to have a lot to your place , which will undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
the point at a time when i went to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long , long enough to wash over a million times , pants get 凑合 . 
so , through this several years old , i finally pants 上街 to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and said , &quot; you &apos;re 紧身 type , comfort , and it &apos;s 宽松 for ? 
the first to 扣子 and pull locked ? 石磨 and acid wash ? 
you just a quick them ? 
and the mouth , or the back of ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my chin . when i was off 缓 through it , and i asked , “ to me that was the only kind of pattern ” . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it is worse . 
why ? why this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is because there are so many can choose for a sex , my jeans exactly how good is going to be good expectations greatly rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a while , i don &apos;t have too much on . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at best 极致 is a perfect . 
and that &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i want to do better than i expected , and together , and it &apos;s just become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for people to do is to have a lot of good expectations outside doesn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize and less happy , even though it &apos;s a good results . 
and the people who don &apos;t know the truth . because if they there are people understand it , you don &apos;t have to know what does that mean ? i mean it . 
it &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s a belief : in everything , terrible over all than now better . 
and the reason is that when one of the things that are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , perfect . we take for granted , for every one of the things you most only hope than you , it &apos;s not all bad . 
you will never be what was amazing to me , because your expectations are higher than a day . 
what is the secret to happiness , which is you here today to want to know , is this : the secret to happiness 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so now , &quot; i want to talk about their smoking a little bit of time , i married my wife , and she was a perfect wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now in a shop for your jeans hundreds of choice , you buy a back , it wasn &apos;t happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t have any excuse to make things might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be good , and they were so disappointed to decide , though , is to blame myself . 
and for our generation , the industrialized countries in the world -- the clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
and the net effect on the object , even though is that we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this now to bring happiness -- the standard principles , and we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but not just this reasoning to more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve got far beyond what we actually ‘ choice ’ needs the critical value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , give us that industrial society has lots of options , is a huge abundance of matter . 
and there &apos;s a lot of the world where , at least , we heard a few of those , there &apos;s no problem , too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern western societies on one particular problem . 
sr : 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we produce the expensive and to operate the car seats 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m saying is that these expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really has brought us harm . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not as from before . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and fix it . 
products redistribution , will allow us all , it &apos;s not just the poor , living good , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing on the positions “ said , &quot; huh , the fish , know what ? 
to tell you , in this fish in all ” is impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
well , i would want more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the happiness . 
you &apos;ve added is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs this ” “ fish . 
in this fish and -- you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit smaller , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but there &apos;s a symbolic fish , it means to be suffering , perhaps , is a disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning , and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to do with those digital code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” , i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
and now we have spent 20 years , almost to the digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome from biology , and it was in the world , entered the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask , if we could build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create a new life ? 
this is a microbial sequence chart , mycoplasma genitalium . and it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 genes from 一百组 separate out in front of us that these . 
so , we can continue to research that the only way is to synthesize that genome that we can change its component to continue to ask the fundamental problem . 
so we started walking along the way that we can keep “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we never make a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , by the way down , just to survive without some sort of chemicals . 
our digital life constantly going up exponentially . . 
we can write the code , much slower progress , but it was accelerating . we recently is going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
in fact , it through a couple steps . when we did the first trial years ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world &apos;s 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna , at 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , the more fragmented made a mistake , longer , the more and more . 
so we had to create a new way to make these little snippet emissions together , and it all wrong . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 genome and bacteriophage -- to digital information . 
one can kill bacteria small virus . 
we designed this gene pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 symbol of dna . 
the second phase of exciting when we put this video we don &apos;t have to put the chemicals that bacteria that started reading the genetic code , building the virus particles . 
and then the cell to release the virus particles , and return to kill e. coli 革 and 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , and i think they have a model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud , more than you . 
so we think this is actually a biological systems in software that could make yourself in the hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re on a computer started using digital information . that &apos;s the digital information must be pretty accurate . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , right , gene sequencing is every 10,000 primary criteria for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , the sequence is 30 mistakes . and if we use to sequence the genome , it will never be turned on . 
design work is part of the length of time designing 50 character and the other 50 scripts 叠加 to build a piece of times smaller units . we need to design before they get together . 
and we have to design a specific part . 
you may have heard that we &apos;re involved in 水印 . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
the character of the body -- and these scripts 三联 编成 about 20 amino acids , like every amino acids , there was one of them . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece is able to use enzyme 裁 cutting . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and we started making pieces , which 7000 character from time to put them together make 24 , people ask the length of time and pull 几组 snippet merger , at a time for people . 
at every stage , we got this piece of culture , so we can give them -- because we wanted to create a very , very reliable . you &apos;re looking for a minute . 
we try to get an automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when this big piece of basic over 100,000 people , when they &apos;re hard to keep the e. coil . for a long , and try to do a variety of modern molecular biologist in the tools we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , it will take time to assemble . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation that is able to withstand 球菌 三百万度 radiation amount . 
you can see on top of the images , and its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will be back together again , their original form before . 
we have this one can 千种 microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move in a new with water . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images , through this process , which is the mentioned yeast way and put it right , we design pieces . yeast automatically going and aggregates . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope at it . 
this is a long time about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is a 580000 symbol than the genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface , no distance , it will print out . it takes the genetic code 142页 to print . 
so how do we launched a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is very simple process a bacterium , which is more complicated . 
with like us , it &apos;s a biological and relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they 连成 came with the cells , but recently , we know we can do a whole transplanting cells from the chromosome from one to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process to stop there . but we &apos;re trying to put this into a better design process . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve all had second chromosome species or from other parts of the third side , in a second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution , and it would have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digesting the dna . 
the cells to have this enzyme without this enzyme when we add in a has this enzyme chromosome . 
it was out and work out of the chromosome is no matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a has a new dna . 
we put a gene causing it became blue . 
in a very short period of time , all of the original species for all disappeared , and completely into a new species , given that we put the cells ” “ new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , they change -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , actually , is we put into it . 
this might sound like 炼金术 genes , but we actually get through to transfer of dna , to radically change things . 
now , i want to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of a life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think , for some reason we do need to be very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years to nine billion in 65亿 from . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to every single one of us from 1946 , who is in the next 40 years , it &apos;s become four minutes . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is a 一千万桶 . 
when we try to think about the biology -- or no substitute for this program , which is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is this material is indicated in the atmosphere of co2 emissions . 
we &apos;re from around the world that had a contains approximately 两千万组 genetic data , and i like to see them as the design components . 
electric industry only 10 to kind of components , and if we could get diversity . 
now , our main limit from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because they can make that we call the mixing of “ ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and it &apos;s only criteria . we can choose to survive , to choose to produce biofuels , or chemical production vaccines , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit at work in the computer to design species actually use software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what is the genetic code , they look like . 
we &apos;re starting to put the “ 第四代 ” fuel . 
you just saw going into corn ethanol is a bad experiment . 
soon we will have a second and third generations fuel , which is sugar into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
sunlight and carbon dioxide -- that &apos;s one way . 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in 1.5英里 deep , deep sea . it was almost boiling water of life . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecules and its energy source . 
we &apos;re seeing is able to collect the two : no , really , they &apos;re very easy to get a handle on , into the fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase the &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic question of understanding . 
we really have 化工 with the oil industry , the little target . now , if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there are probably ? as a primary energy . 
and we &apos;re using the tools to create a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you &apos;ve seen this year &apos;s flu , we tend to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine for change . 
this is the future might present situation with change , right now , the evolutionary tree , with synthetic 古物 species of bacteria , and it &apos;s a biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re really improve people &apos;s lives , and from a long way , our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this short on 09年 at u speak of , brian cox : shares some 对撞机 news , which are now in content , to repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted , i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must have come back to update reality machine is running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
it &apos;s ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use it for a big bang some camera detector . 
this is what i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is a picture of atlas shine down . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters of particles around the lhc . along the way , as we are planning to , with a part of the lhc . the particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see here a in september 10号 visually , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know if this is getting 满堂喝彩 was this -- when you go to google , saw that graph front page . 
this suggests that we work with this as a culture of it as significant as the scientific . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does with the main 导线 about -- the golden 导线 . 
and when they 导线 transmission 安培 electricity on them . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do , because when it &apos;s a very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below the surface of the space between the case that these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 电磁铁 九千多个 in one of the 接点 installed in a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises a little bit of it is the transmission 安培 electricity and they were resistance 
this is . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
we have about 50 magnets damage . 
must 卸 them , the work has done . 
we gave them out error and repair it . 
now just wait for them back to the ground . 
in three 月底 refer to be about the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it , and hopefully in june , july , to data and get out of our most basic of the universe . 
and obviously now , one of these accidents 激化 back about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think this mission too difficult still what we want to my reality itself , which is where the value of the lhc . 
thank you . 
elizabeth gilbert . 呵护 talks with creative and reduce stress . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was obsessed with the love of life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event , however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and no matter where i , people like me that this is the result is life , and no matter where i , people like me that life like this . 
really , like , completely , not saved playing 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very depression , and as i said , &quot; “ you not afraid ? no . you can transcend all my life and the book ” ? 
it &apos;s really going to comfort people ! 
i was around with the same question , people say , you &apos;re afraid will never work ? 
you &apos;re afraid of sustainable refused to take you click otherwise ? 
you end up in a broken dream of despair and die , covered in 苦痛 failed , i was always get that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
well , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people think that that is beyond that , i &apos;m afraid that many people that don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , speaking of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear writing ? but , speaking of writing , i have been wondering , why would i fear writing ? 
this is a better idea ? 
people fear for their own destiny work ? it logical ? people fear for their own destiny work ? it logical ? 
nobody “ said , &quot; john , chemistry to work with bottleneck ? how ” ? 
never would happen this question . 
of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineering at this group , not in the last few centuries , by the addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last few centuries , by the addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of the century , the great creativity 英年早逝 wizards in case you just look at the early years of the century , every field 英年早逝 wizards great creativity is always the case of suicide age lightly . 
if that wasn &apos;t suicidal , it &apos;s not completely shows their talent , even though that wasn &apos;t suicidal , it &apos;s not completely shows their brilliance 
and the 曼梅 le , died in front of the interview last “ said , &quot; i have every book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
in your life &apos;s work , and this is a radical statement . 
today i want to ask all of you are , you have no dispute about that ? i &apos;m going to ask all of you are , you have no dispute about that ? 
all of you think this sentiment no problem ? take a little bit further away at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 even a little bit further away at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this 臆断 species . 
this is not only 可憎 and awful , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this is not only 可憎 and awful , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the point of this century , it &apos;s not only 可憎 , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative genius , they will be to live . 
and my own case , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 and myself , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , especially in my career in this particular moment in my career . 
you know , i was young , i just for 40 years old , you know , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for career 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say that in my heart , and it &apos;s very possible , and i &apos;ve ever been the most successful . 
oh my god , it &apos;s kind of ideas . 
is this idea that makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , is this idea that makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : i should do ? 
and it into perspective , for me to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance away from the writing , and i work for the responses from the extreme concern , and i started writing about the extreme concern response . 
this one for the last brought me into the greek and ancient rome . 
so please bear with me , because the sound around us back to the problem . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred tense elves from remote places , and you know , the next artist came up with a remote and you know what the distant and you know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks universal to call it a with creative , to the djinn “ for 守护神 ” 
and for people to think socrates is such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him wisdom was that people often think that , socrates is such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius djinn “ called ” ancient rome , people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create djinn “ called ” genius 
this is a wonderful , because the romans didn &apos;t think that &apos;s one particular ” “ genius 聪慧 individuals , this is a wonderful , because the romans didn &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particular individual 聪慧 . 
this is really amazing , this is what i &apos;m looking at this safe distance , this is what makes people from 成败 work on the psychological protection . 
we can understand that business model , right ? 
the artist by this idea , and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this point , and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great . it &apos;s not completely thanks to you because you know , you &apos;re in a glass “ ” geniuses work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you &apos;re really bad ” “ genius 
this is the western for over a long time thinking about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
无异 to ask him to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , that &apos;s too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of the cognitive , and so forth for people to expand expect it completely straight up twisted , one of our individual , and that was done in the line . 
i think is kind of stresses , in the last 500 years together with many artists , i think is kind of stresses , in the last 500 years of artists together . 
if it &apos;s like , at least , i think that &apos;s so the question is : what should we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : what should we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 500多年 developed out of the reason we don &apos;t mind with a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 off developed 500多年 rationality humanities . 
maybe i could not convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? i mean , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , and no one had ever tried to make us believe in a row , you &apos;ve all had this experience of the things that are going to make it doesn &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , we can make sense , sometimes it &apos;s 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath , and the really towards her . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is the power to 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is the power to 撼动 her feet into the ground . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with the only thing that she would say , is to “ 死命 狂奔 ” 
at some point , this is called me the most amazing part : at some point , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab that poem 顺势 its tail to pull back on the other hand , poetry to put it on paper 誊写 顺势 pulled back on the other hand , poetry to 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper , except in the upside down , from the beginning , by the way back to the top , until one word . 
i heard her story and , like , crazy , and i , of course , the creative process , and it &apos;s not all of the creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 like me , and also inadvertently get an idea , but even 古板 like me , and also going to get an accident . 
there are people may have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have don &apos;t know where inspiration comes in , and if you want 墨守成规 people like me , would have don &apos;t know where inspiration comes . 
this is exactly what happened ? 
in how we &apos;re looking at it , it will not losing rational ? in how we &apos;re looking at it , it will not losing rational ?

since that event , and tom of the creative process . 
not work changed , and we &apos;re still onto something is still the dark . 
for inspiration can is his , and this might exist between the weird and surprising and strange relationship creative inspiration you with this one is that he might exist between the weird and surprising and strange relationship that &apos;s one way beyond ourselves . 
this story 潜移默化 my work to change the way , this transformation has saved me this story , a 潜移默化 to change the way my work , this transformation has saved me again .

“ if you want this book better , it &apos;s now your turn them and do your part ” work . 
“ if you &apos;re not to help , that you see the to ” . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to write down , because that &apos;s my job . &quot; 
today , i hope that the historical record 尽责 : i got my jobs and 坚守 € today , i hope that the historical record 尽责 : i 坚守 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they were great professional dancer who plays a wonderful , because they were great professional dancer 
occasionally , although very unlikely , but actually happen at a dancer going beyond present 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you &apos;re ever in a moment , have seen that . 
it seems to stop , across time dancers seems to be stopped , across the dancer was what he did . and before the 1000场 performance isn &apos;t something different , but everything was amazingly unified together . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom of the light that he was shine . 
and people , to know exactly what it is , they can call out of its name was clearly , people know what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing wondrous give , people will 喝彩 “ : arturo 嘞 欧 , la , la , oh , 欧 嘞 really wonderful , wonderful , wonderful ” , which is good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most intractable in the morning , dancers 悠悠 come up with an artist , for the most intractable in the morning , dancers 悠悠 up on a tuesday morning , that &apos;s 11 , he &apos;s good , there is no god with . 
and just when the leg , well , you &apos;re going to the old man , and he might last night , couldn &apos;t reach that level . 
it never has on his dancing with his 喝彩 when it &apos;s good , there are they going to do ? 
this is a very smart questions , and the creative process of understanding the pain . 
this is a very smart questions , and the creative process , the pain of cognitive . this is a very smart questions , and the creative process of understanding the pain . 
but perhaps , we would have so much pain , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this point , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach the idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore here at ted global shows the new situation , that this is more than a scientist , and that he was worried about “ ” clean coal . 
al gore the warning about the climate . 
last year , i &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the past , the size of the equivalent of the southern 48 state 缩减 40 percent of the surface . 
but that didn &apos;t fully illustrate that question . because it &apos;s not that rare of ice cap . 
it feels like the polar ice cap -- just like a good global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer 舒张 your heart . 
i &apos;m going to show is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 . 
red is a permanent 冻 ice 
you see , it &apos;s in a dark blue here is a form of the year in the summer ice 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or more years into the ice , you know , it &apos;s like a blood 各部 guy in the body to move . 
in the 25 years , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that 冻土 受热 layer around the arctic ocean , and there &apos;s lots of being 冻 your carbon and 解冻 干冰 . it &apos;s methane , carbon compost . 
if you break of light , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the lake in alaska in shallow water now you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a shallow lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
one reason , the sink , which is a heat heating . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but traffic 往年 than they are . 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of ice melts , sea levels rising and how to make it 入海口 . 
here are the traffic 急速 . 
antarctica , the other end of this planet , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melting 
that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level with 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas and the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
the global financial water from 40 to 50 percent of the water . 
in the ice 安第斯 mountains , this is the city of drinking water . 
traffic was . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in california , sierra 40 percent of the ice every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you can see , we are very serious . 
global is the fire and dry in numbers . 
and the world &apos;s population are disasters in absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years in time , to the earlier 总数 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we day 七千万吨 increasing co2 emissions from the ocean 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
look at the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
most of the greenhouse effect , except , of forest destruction is burning fossil fuels , 20 percent . 
oil and coal most urgent matter 
america is a global two big one country emissions , and china . 
the solution was to build a use more coal carbon planet . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative solutions . 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political . 
and the coal carbon from oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth , in my hometown , tennessee digging 淤泥 coal of billions of . 
you probably saw in the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of coal carbon industry . 
coal is happy and pleasant and cool the avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive economy , and he also help us . 
coal mr. cool every day to become more clean 
he &apos;s lovely sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia 产地 the coal . 
most of the head of the coal mining massey 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and now one of the work of two projects . 
this is one part of one . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to set our initial goal explaining coal mine , and the truth . 
in fact , coal , not dirty 
we think it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , rather than worrying about global warming . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plants . 
spectacular 喧哗 some machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming , the main reasons here you see the incredible fascinated with clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
america is in the economy and national security , the climate crisis . 
will the crisis is strings together is that we are based on carbon oil products on like dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solutions to solving these problems . 
america repower with 100 percent renewable electricity in a time . 
and the people who got new work to our lives more safe , and so this is not warming . 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
to understand more repower america . 
the last one . 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
old dirty oil and murder of our planet , which is , let &apos;s cut to rely on the fastest way . 
this was the wind and solar power , and new energy . 
new investment to create more money there &apos;s lots of jobs . 
repower america . it &apos;s time to dream well . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent before . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 before . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first , i want you to remember when you &apos;re being a kid with a kit . 
when you design and how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re learning how to think about and problem solving . this is the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
what really helps us 空间结构 objects around a lot to learn something . 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find answers , and therefore the infant siftables . 
simplest siftable , with a computer , it &apos;s like a cookie size . 
siftables can hand moves , just 每块 siftable can move each other &apos;s perception each 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can have with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information using the tools . 
these are tools , with independence , more sensitive to each other , with all its senses , mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and it &apos;s indicated in this picture , and maybe if i put it in the opposite direction , maybe that image it in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables to each other senses . 
if you give them a 挨 a out ok , interesting things can happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that will have a mess . 
they can perceive moves each other , and maybe . 
we found an interesting interaction -- we can use some siftables interact with gestures , such as a liquid that from the color of siftable siftable into another one . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel paint with siftables model , we can take these barrel into color in the middle , which color , put together . 
if you took a lot of , could you go back . 
siftables and learning machine function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to learn from these functions 快捷 , getting faster at it . 
and i &apos;m here to show you why -- and siftables applause . this is me with a simple formula for a fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together word scrabble -- a remix boggle and build a game . &quot; 
these people have a way to play games like down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter 几块 siftables together to make a word , in the dictionary siftables automatically find words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spelling out to change the sequence shows up , the words , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so -- -- thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because siftables participate in the test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in the game play the spell words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them , and this is a word “ spell ” game , they know how to do . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now i have on the screen function interact with it a try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
and on this kid &apos;s felix . 
he could use it to add some new elements of the images , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animated graphics put a video , you can put these new element to put it on . 
see , he added up the sun . 
the sun liters up . 
david , and he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
the shake siftables in animation images can turn it into a new element . he took on added up new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open-source end of story , he &apos;s planning to develop stories plot . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you a final show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed siftables , the function of the sound domain , can make like 超载 tone and bess and drum sound . 
and there were 四档 available for change , 任君 choice . 
you can take sounds siftable tiles . the voice to the tiles siftable by the way that you love . 
to sound just come close to the sound of the modules . 
and this is a voice 响器 filter , which works siftable module . 
and this kind of come to sound tiles that you can adjust the sound . 
so , we can use to control and rhythm and volume of the modules siftable come close to edit siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
start with the 超载 put into the two tiles , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 sound . 
now the filter acoustic tile near drums modules , it can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to accelerate rhythm and pace of just come close to edit module . 
now let &apos;s put a acoustic tile approaching the functions pei filter voice . 
in the process of playing music , we can also 编排 . 
so you don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s based on play , over time , but long , long . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited modules , come to this place on the left . 
and so -- -- thank you . 
as you see , my vision is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable , our next research lab was doing . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and the technology , it &apos;s going to change this world that innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
