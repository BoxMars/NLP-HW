and through pictures purpose rapture story , a national geographic by wade davis explorers of the aboriginal culture celebrate diversity , these extraordinary culture is an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are born in 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl , sculpted by millennia . 
生离死别 cruel to face , so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life in the art that we create . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 . 
if you &apos;re thinking about you send will now , this different mind makes you see hope . 
the world 五彩缤纷 犹如 a culture of mental life and culture in the life intertwined and covered the entire planet it for a very important 芸芸众生 earth as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also a strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
by the biosphere as big as race circles are facing the same shorter , and it faster destruction . 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet would have 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar rules . 
language is shining human spirit . 
and it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a mind a conscious and a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and our audience numbers here in the language as much in half no longer have to teach kids 
these language has 传人 didn &apos;t do that unless it works they will completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be a 本族语 said the people who couldn &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
and that &apos;s a terrible on earth about every two weeks will have a 仙逝 年长者 with the old with a language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race about race loop loop give you a rough understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people who have already forgot . i said “ different ” way of living in front of me said ” “ different ways . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 northwest part of the pull played methuselah 蚺 that they &apos;re called the race because they believe in a time that they 米尔克 from the sacred river 东岸 was used for . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because the jungle , so they 栖身 天穹 in their view to the forest canopy didn &apos;t . 
they said in a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 异族 linguistics called 通婚 with one person to people who got married , a different language . 
this is the mythology of historical lineage , and you can see a strange phenomenon 婚 异族 because of the reason it &apos;s a 大家族 六七种 language you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i &apos;ve been exposed to many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had to peace . 
five missionary 1957 years to approach them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they from the sky 十张 eight to leave their himself in the picture , we think this is nice , but they don &apos;t think that these 雨林中 live in the people who &apos;ve never seen a two-dimensional . 
they pick up from the forest to get over these pictures and images , trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to devil cards , so they use 戮 with spears and five missionary died . 
more terrifying 戮 华拉尼 is not only at people . 
and they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of the population was their 戮 to die . 
we have to survey found only 一个八代 宗谱 两例 刨根问底 our natural death with the truth , they finally , the more it will 年迈 to wood , and they would 戮 送终 for him . 
the other hand , they have astonishing for bush 惊诧 perspective . 
they predator can smell 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the mysteries i have to figure out this amazing religious voodoo teach them how thing voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
christianity , islam , there &apos;s some other buddhist religion . 
the unique about voodoo in life , and it &apos;s the connection between . 
in the living soul . 
and the rhythm of dance with 翩翩起舞 can 大水 to just replace under the soul of the soul of life in the short shining 侍僧成 moment for god . 
so voodoo believers , like to say you go to church worship to call god . 
we dance to be in the temple . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . what &apos;s going to get hurt ? 
and i have to have all of life in the northern columbia 玛尔塔 科基人 the mountains of the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization progeny they were once conquered and occupation . the coast in plain columbia 此后 them back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent this race has never been the spaniards . 
and to today , they would rule 续 along with monk , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk 
they like 母腹 back to those groups are taught the values that maintain the values is the relationship between the believers , and we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s the beauty of how you want to protect it . 
they call themselves 兄长 弟兄 for our call to say we are destroying the world . 
the ability to create this intuition , very important . 
aboriginal people will not 思乡 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the torture 
so what does that mean ? 
and that is the mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s important for meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia who grew up on the idea of the jungle , i think is going to be logging . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this photo was me last year in august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia 徒 萨满教 plant to use it -- dead cane water made psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent of color in the brain is it within five 羟 -- which is very close to 成份 . 
jamie tribes 亚诺马 from people who would have five 羟 -- which is plants extract the nose took crack and use . 
if you take a sip into the powder 光怪陆离 hallucinations , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you were totally wiped out , but not distorted 
but the color is matter , because they didn &apos;t oral organs will be one of the body alone is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
which is to oral these things have to change and oral 氧化酶 is one of the other chemicals alive . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that in there β 藤本植物 啉 咔 -- this is exactly what you can play the color is 氧化酶 and varietals 不由得 so you ask themselves . 
when we do all kinds of experiments constantly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes of dead people found in the cane is they &apos;re all in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them a hierarchy is how to these plants , they said , &quot; i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , and i said , it &apos;s not about 
and i tell you , if they said in the circle months in the night that plants that grow in every a little different , singing to you . 
and that would not let you get harvard ph.d. 报表 accounting , but it &apos;s more than fun . 
dh : now we have this question , although we compassion in some tragedy indigenous people think they 离群索居 丰富多彩 living world forward , but as we develop these people go to the edge of history in . 
and all cultures have been by new way of life as a strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue mobs indians even down 弓箭 still is great sioux nation indians and americans say goodbye 骑马 and sit still was 马车 life in the united states . 
the threat race 完整性 layer is not change the technological innovation , or power line , but all he was barbaric . 
let &apos;s look at the mountains tibet recently where i do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide culture extinction is destruction people lifestyle by denounce 行径 didn &apos;t even be in many places it as part of this strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man 班禅 喇嘛 皈依 father 
the chinese immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other together fled to nepal . 
his mother 富农 because 关押 by 成份 and family . 
he was only one or two 悄悄地 his mother to his hidden dress and bring him into his because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and 学习班 into being . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be on the facts of your hair 臂章 and be guilty about seven years of a nation to accept 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to take the human spirit redemption to get witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a world of needed a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
think about it , we &apos;ve got 60 in the world &apos;s 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
time for human revolution 新石器 agricultural age we enter the seeds , he went to 腊 girl 祭 萨满 poetry is the mantra for cheese that we create a level of 社会分工 . it just 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
and i think this brief history was enough to make the future , we have the ability to solve the challenges facing . 
when we tell the world cultures for life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a completely fully realize the species that we have to make sure that all race and all of those organisms 昌盛 for life . 
this is a picture i 巴芬岛 in the northern part of the mountain . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 called whales that people tell me about a legacy of about his grandfather . 
in the 1950s , the government is not always practice inuit people to build our sovereign states that we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this is the old to move . 
he worried that his family safely put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , this is their god alone thick . 
they sled of the first slide 鹿皮 caribou clad in north america 冻 of a fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night , and the blizzard 凛冽 
he &apos;s slept in outside wearing his seal -- he put a stool 长裤 skin to hand when stool quickly become stiff , he put it into shape blades . 
and in this shit to make a blades 口水 on the edge , and it &apos;s frozen and become very robust after he 宰杀 刀子 to use this dog . 
the dogs bark 剥 挽具 and then he made a dog made out of his dog sleds condom to another between don &apos;t have that when you put it in a shit ice sheet . 
this is really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways dh : this is the world inuit people all indigenous life force 写照 real 顽强 . 
1999 four months than the government to an area the size of california and texas 之和 returned to the land back to the inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called new le dimensions , 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do something with it managed to repair the relationship between people . 
and i think the world for ever on a remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a 族类 home . 
they represent the human imagination go back to the ancient branch of time for all of our people dream of these kids with our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think jt debate is not to convince people through , but we think about it can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s at about the institution a click on our website to thousands of up to three 百万次 five 
we 156 channels of play in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos of have this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from the internet use . pick out a static image of created an absolute brute photosynth , like , and can navigate dream of . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
here we see is many many gb and 千兆 byte . level of digital photographs , and they can do for smooth and mapping zoom in , you can browse them by the way , you can do to rearrange them . 
no matter how data can see how much of an image , and how big the images seadragon , has the ability to deal with that . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference with our system , because the only factor is just , you use the screen like 素数 seadragon . and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of data . 
this is what he dickens 山庄 , &quot; &quot; 荒凉 line is chapter of content . 
i &apos;ll give you prove that this is really not text and images , we can do this , you can see it &apos;s really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be a reading an electronic book . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
this is a 张大 each one of the opening . 
and the paper , or magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , when people get better reading experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
we do here a little change issues in this &quot; the guardian &quot; to the corner . 
we make a high-resolution picture advertising than this -- you just see the regular advertising higher resolution , embedded in a lot of pictures of the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to avoid the screen actually used the limits of area . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and this information . 
obviously , technology applications for this map is obvious , number one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made this field for your contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually combined the two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is another graduate students from the university of washington snavely noah undertake computer visual research findings . this research and get seitz steve washington university . 
and microsoft institute szeliski rick help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got applied , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to have multiple ways of looking at pictures and images do subtlety to have more 剖析 and the resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there are many examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make site , to take care of to a legal issues . 
these are all the images from flickr by this , by 串联 up in space . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would end to work for microsoft 
by this welcome , really quite amazing happy . 
i think you can see from these pictures of the camera , many different from the mobile phone camera into a single . so a lot of different quality , in this picture was all put together in the environment . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so forth . 
i remember here should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can effectively online community with everyone . we can start to get everyone to different data environment memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures are intertwined , however , to a much more than just gather up all . 
what this model is a crime , the whole planet . 
this is stephen lawler , like the virtual earth , &quot; the long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , will be 注 you picture the labels . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years from around the world will 接合 pictures together ? 
this software is . that &apos;s the real meaning to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this process is completely 接合 images based on the content . 
the more exciting is that picture contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , what you &apos;re in the picture , after the button on the web , to have a lot of text that information with this picture . 
now , suppose you all of these pictures and images being , that would be like ? 
now , so these semantic information to each other inside of links , and is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible congratulate . you ! 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think here to talk about this book , i hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to tell from a recognized the creed of it . 
well , what the standard ? 
that &apos;s the western 笃信 疑 industrial society is not a creed . 
well , this is to say this : if we want to make people get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is this thing in the freedom to itself is good , valuable , for what they need to . 
and once people had freedom , each of us can 做主 yourself with the big enough to do all kinds of benefits , don &apos;t get people to 做主 them for me . 
and the freedom to make a big enough to do is increase selective . 
people more choices , it &apos;s more freedom , freedom , and you get more and more &apos;s welfare . 
i think , this idea that we like 掺 into the water that deep-rooted that nobody wants to be asking questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives of . 
let me give you some examples of modern society at the progress of development we become possible to do something . 
this is my nearby . not a big supermarket . 
i just want to say this salad ingredients . 
you see , it &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional stereo system -- voice box for a cd , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a one shop three-dimensional stereo system is much couldn &apos;t count . 
in the store components , you can 650万种 close with a combination of the three-dimensional stereo system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer telephone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s not going to die all bad . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an infinite taxonomy species , especially mobile phone looks . that cartoons . 
these are the mobile phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 -- that will mp with the three and a nose , cutting hair 布丁 火枪 in 焦糖 french . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , with no long , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store ask : what are you don &apos;t have a with so many function ? &quot; 
you want , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
” “ answer is no . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phone . 
again , in some other life in more than shopping to affect the things that we have the bang , this is the same . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , who straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth nail solutions are very and risk . 
and so forth 乙 solutions are very and risk ? how do you want to treat . 
and you say , “ doctor , how do i do ” ? 
they said , again , there are these things and nail 乙 risk , there are those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
doctor : you can ask “ doctor , you &apos;re me , that you choose ” ? 
they said , &quot; but i don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for these people with you and me . if you think about , a little bit and say , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why are they doing marketing campaign to us ? 
they want to answer is , we looked at the morning after advertising would go to your doctor , to the doctor to call the prescription drugs , put in them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became choice topic . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now we gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by themselves to invent . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do a kind of people and men and women -- make decisions . 
in marriage family ways , in the last everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is of course , and that is 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices and who &apos;s got married , and it &apos;s not what you see , it &apos;s not married , after what to do . 
and today , about everything that can take 拣 挑拣 pick . 
i teach a bunch of good and bright students , but now i give them all placed homework fifth time less than one . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever students -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re thinking , are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask ourselves : what i should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is going to marry now ? 
and after that first ? i &apos;m trying to kids , let &apos;s 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still not doing my homework , and whether all placed in my class and they take a what grades . 
they really should go to these problems , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can any time , in one day in the earth in a corner of the work -- the basket 夫 , except a hotel . 
but , in this restaurant where you can actually have a wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible choice is freedom to us in the choice we have to make decisions , again , again , again , to work for themselves now about and it &apos;s going to break . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 put on the phone , it in another 裤兜 blackberry and with their blackberry or -- the lap , and laptops . 
even though they &apos;re off , we are looking at the same 场上 rivals for children are constantly ask myself , i don &apos;t pick the phone ? 
back to this email or not ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this was 信稿 ? 
if you give their answer was no , you &apos;re a kid that was the game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a little thing , the issue of matter , it &apos;s a lifestyle choice of life is . 
we used to live in the world is like this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
today we live , and this is the world . 
the question is , what is good news or bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
first of all , it says something paradox , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us is not liberation , but box , is paralysis . 
people with so many choices to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is about a project for pension in ways to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest in record vanguard vanguard . that &apos;s a big support fund companies , have about two million people and 000多个 , office place . 
her research that &apos;s when the clients and to their employees to support fund -- increase of every 10 to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , you give people more than 10 percent when down 5种 fund . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s , preferably tomorrow &apos;s , of course , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they 5千元 as much of a year get an employer 对等 手边 from 溜掉 employer . that was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , it &apos;s too many choices are paralyzed rigid . 
it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make that decision is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
there you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation , or is it salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices to ridiculous , something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make choices . 
secondly , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost of things . 
earlier today dan gilbert . about a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a choice can think about it , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you choose to give up the compelling ways for you . it &apos;s always right you see that the 美中不足 think . 
let me give you an example -- and shows comics , but if you are not new yorker , and i &apos;ll 歉 a . 
but this is something you should think right now . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the area , expensive . 
gorgeous beach , 明媚 sunlight , they have all this . 
can better than that ? it &apos;s now to “ huh , they &apos;re really bad , ” “ ” , in august now . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home ” . 
i &apos;m going to be “ can get back to my own car stop front ” . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day is lost to 念叨 in the good parking opportunity . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let us not to have to make a decision it &apos;s actually quite happy if 英明 . 
we have more options and choices to people in what &apos;s more , and all these things in the opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also say “ ” now live in a sense , maybe there &apos;s this thing to do step one . 
but , of a truth is , when you chose to do something , you and you have chosen not to do other things . 
these other things tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time , i went to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants appropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long , long enough to wash the times , and then get 凑合 pants . 
this is , in many years old , i finally 上街 pants to buy a new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and said , you have to type , comfort 紧身 type , was 宽松 for ? 
it &apos;s in front of 扣子 to pull locked 石磨 ? or is this wash ? 
that come to a broken ? 
and the mouth , and it &apos;s a mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i asked me to “ , that was the only kind of pattern ” . 
and he fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it is worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse , the reason is because there &apos;s so much , i can choose for a sex jeans what should have more good to be good expectations big rise . 
i was very low expectations . and then a jeans is too much , and i didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have a hundred dimensions , huh , the best at least a 极致 is perfect . 
and that &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i got i already have , and i expect to compare , and i expect more like this one , i became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s much better for people outside didn &apos;t expect that many benefits . 
that &apos;s just make people less happy about it , even though it &apos;s the best results . 
there &apos;s nobody to market understand this , because if they sense . there &apos;s people understand it , you don &apos;t have to know what is this cartoon means -- i mean . 
it &apos;s like this and it &apos;s a belief : very bad , everything in the past , everything is better than now . 
and the reason why is that when one of the things that are not so good , people could have experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every one of the things that you only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
what you will never be surprised , because what you expect me than day and high . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret to happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so now you a little bit of time -- i want to talk about myself , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 no , i try . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now in store for you to the hundreds of jeans , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , who &apos;s responsibility for what ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and the hundreds of jeans out there , you don &apos;t have any excuse to things might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even to achieve results that they &apos;re good for -- is so disappointed , decided to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and the clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever good , but they don &apos;t feel like from the front . 
i remind you . 
this now to bring happiness -- the standard principles , we all think is right , it &apos;s wrong . it &apos;s not right . 
there &apos;s no choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond the ’ rich ‘ choice , and we need to the critical value . 
i &apos;ll say it . and here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , give us that industrial society that more choices that is matter , a rich . 
we have a lot of the world where , at least , we heard a few of those , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so here i talk about this topic is modern western societies on a particular problem . 
steve 里维特 . yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we produce the expensive and to operate the car seats 于事无补 , just in waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is the expensive and complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really bring us harm . 
they actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call 帕累 thomas improving the way . 
redistribution products to all of that , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of the problems we as a plague of extra choice . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position “ said , &quot; huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in everything on this fish is impossible ” . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , that &apos;s interpretation . 
but i think , the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is paralyzed , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs this “ ” fish . 
and this fish and -- you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit smaller , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means , maybe it &apos;s going to suffering , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working in the digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from the numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
“ ” what life is a biologist , i think it &apos;s constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we have to almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from the biological mimic analysis entered the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to question , if we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome can make it in the lab self-replication . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 from the genes that we 一百组 separate out in front of this . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue to question the basic question . 
so we started walking along this path , we can keep “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these we never had supermassive molecules ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , by the way down , don &apos;t live is just some sort of chemicals . 
we constantly digital life in the pace of exponential speed . 
we write gene code is capable of progress , or very slow , but also to increase in our recent . is going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work is 15 years ago . 
in fact , it through the stages . and when we do for the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
in the world &apos;s 十几万台 device made small pieces of dna , length in 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , long time made that mistake , the more and more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together , and it all wrong . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 genome and bacteriophage -- digital information started . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 symbol of dna . 
the most exciting phase is when we put this video don &apos;t have to live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building virus particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli 革 and 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with some of the oil industry , and i think they communicate this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so what we think this is actually a biological system in software to make yourself in the hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that this digital information must be very accurate . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , right , gene sequencing is every 10,000 basic standard for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , when the average sequence is 30 wrong . and if we use to sequence , it &apos;ll never set of genes are turned on . 
design work is part of the length of time designing 50 character and the other 50 character long 叠加 pieces of time to build smaller units . we need to design that they can together . 
we &apos;re designing there &apos;s a unique part . 
you may have heard about 水印 join us in the middle of it . 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 the body -- and these scripts 编成 about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the first , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we designed this piece , and can use enzyme 裁 to cut . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started building pieces , which 7000 character from time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character 几组 the length of time and time merger 7,000 72 , a long time . 
in every stage , we had this piece of culture , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to reach the level of the automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 of . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 people , when they basically it &apos;s hard to keep coil e. in the long longer . in modern molecular biologist in trying to do a variety of the tools we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology , using dna repair piece together , it can put together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation microbes called 球菌 can withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on top of the images , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosome . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the molecule . 
we can have this 千种 have . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images , by the process , which is the mentioned yeast way through , and we put into the design of the pieces . yeast automatically , will they aggregates . 
this is not an electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
it &apos;s such a big one molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
these are , long about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than a gene code 580000 character . it &apos;s made by humans setting the structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10号 to put the typeface to print out . and you need to print the genetic code 142页 
so how do we launched a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously with a virus that &apos;s a very simple process more complicated . 
with like ourselves this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they came with the 连成 cells , but recently , we also understand that we can do a whole transplant cells from the chromosome from one to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we &apos;re trying to the design process into some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve all had a second chromosomes species or from other parts of the third side chromosomes , in a second increased 数千种 new feature to its own . 
the original by what people in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit enzyme is to digest dna . 
the original cells have this enzyme without this enzyme when we have this enzyme built into a chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the a genome is no matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a has a new dna . 
we put the gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original species for all disappeared , and completely into a new species , we put the cells on the new “ ” software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , they change -- when we reading the genetic code , in fact , it is that we planted . 
this might sound like 炼金术 genes , but we really can radically to move through dna , to change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think , for some reason we do need is very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years to nine billion in 65亿 from 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world becomes three people compared to every single one of us from 1946 is ; the people in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use the coal , 300多亿桶 50亿顿 over oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this creature program or any can replace it program , which is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that the material that was the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now have from around the globe that contains a 两千万组 about genes database , and i just love them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only the electric industry , and look for a components that can get diversity . 
now , our main limits from reality in biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can make “ we call the mixing chromosomes ” group quickly synthetic way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day , the chromosomes . 
and this is just standard choice . we can start to choose to survive , chemical production , or fuel vaccine manufacturing , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit at work in the computer really use software to design the design of the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code , they look like . 
we now bring attention on the “ 第四代 ” fuel . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad experiment . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . it was sugar into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get 第四代 first fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide -- that &apos;s one way . 
so now -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep sea . about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the environment . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen methane , carbon dioxide molecules into the its energy source . 
if we look at the two to collect what &apos;s really , really convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase in life ? &quot; &quot; what is the understanding of basic questions . 
we did with the oil industry a little 化工 goal . so now -- if you can &apos;t do that , at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we are using the tools to make a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see this year &apos;s flu , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think that this can be were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is what the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a synthetic 古物 bacteria , and that &apos;s really a biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better human life and far from the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough to might be able to do this thing . thank you very much . 
the u 09年 in this short ted speak of , brian cox : shares some 对撞机 news , which are now in content , to repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said it back to give you an update on to machines run . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state per second , and it made a 6亿次 state . 
it &apos;s ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these big bang some camera to little detector . 
this is my installation that machine , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the atlas building process , you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last september 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters particles around a picture of all the way down the lhc . we &apos;re planning to as part of the lhc . and of particles , go flying off in 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know is that it &apos;s got this 满堂喝彩 to google -- when people see the front page icons like this . 
this suggests that we work with this shock to a culture of it as a scientific shock . 
but about a week later , we sort out the machine , a little bit about the 导线 with these -- that golden 导线 . 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they started machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do , because when it very low 导线 superconducting into them . 
so in less than planet 271摄氏度 below the temperature of the space between the case of these 导线 can transmission and electricity . 
at the lhc 电磁铁 九千多个 in in a 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of transmission 安培 current and they were resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to about 20 tons they move a ruler miles . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
must 卸 them , the work has done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now wait for them back to the ground . 
in three 月底 refer to be about the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in july , six , get data and continue our mission to figure out the basic unit that the universe . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents 激化 to a cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still want my with the fact is , in the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

however , recently , in my life work a specific event happening , however , recently , in my life work , there is a specific event that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
now , whether it &apos;s where i , people think that i like that . it &apos;s life , and no matter where i , people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , 完了 play . 
they &apos;re very depression , came to me and said , you don &apos;t “ ? not afraid that you &apos;re afraid of my life is not beyond that book ” ? 
they could really be comfort people ! 
i was around with the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you don &apos;t of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in the dream is dead , full of despair , in the 苦痛 failed , i was always get kind of question 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i was afraid to a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , speaking of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? but , speaking of writing , i &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would i fear writing ? 
this is the idea is a rational ? 
people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in my destiny work ? it logical ? 
nobody “ said , &quot; john , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ” ? 
this question never would have happened . 
of course , chemical engineers 平心而论 , it &apos;s a group , not in the last couple of the century addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 and global , not in the last couple of the century addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 and around the world . 
just look at the early years of a century , the great creativity 英年早逝 wizards in case you just look at the early years of a century , every field 英年早逝 wizards great creativity is always the case light died since age . 
they don &apos;t even suicidal , often don &apos;t completely shows their talent that are not even suicidal , often don &apos;t completely shows their brilliance 
the 曼梅 le , died in the last time ago in interviews “ said , every book i 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
in your life &apos;s work , this is how radical statement . 
i want to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? i &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you have no dispute about that ? 
you think this sentiment ? no problem , even a little bit further away at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of a little bit further away from 臆断 even look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断

this idea , and not only 可憎 terrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century this idea , and not only 可憎 terrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative genius , they will be good to live forever . 
and i , myself , believed that it brings me to 绝境 dark , and i , myself , believed that it brings me to 绝境 dark , especially in my career stage right now , especially in my work now . 
you see , i was young , i came to 40 years old , you see , i was young , i only 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years with my 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say is , in my heart , and very likely , is that i &apos;ve ever biggest successes is over . 
oh my god , this is what idea ! 
is this idea , and you &apos;re on a piano 大清早 drank way not to wine , is this idea , and you &apos;re on a piano wine 大清早 drank way not to . i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing career , so the question becomes : what should i do ? 
i want to do what i love writing career , so the question becomes : what should i do ? 
after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
in some way , i have to build a safe distance from the writing itself , and i work for the open outcry extreme concern me for writing , and the response extreme anxiety . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because we end up around the back . 
in the ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human 
people believe , creativity is a sacred djinn from distant and not to know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know from distant and the goal is to know where the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call this a with “ for creativity to djinn 守护神 ” 
and for people to think that there &apos;s a socrates 守护神 , from a distance to give him for people to think wisdom was that there &apos;s a socrates 守护神 , from a distance to give him wisdom 
ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius djinn “ called ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create djinn “ called ” genius 
this is wonderful , because people don &apos;t think “ rome ” genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful , because people don &apos;t think “ rome ” genius is a particular individual 聪慧 . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i was looking at this safe distance , and that &apos;s what makes people from 成败 work on psychological protection . 
we can understand that business model , right ? 
by the artist protection , and get this idea of avoid the narcissism ancient artists and get protected by this idea of narcissism , and avoid . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know , you &apos;re in a glass “ ” geniuses work done . 
if you work , and it &apos;s not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is westerners in the last very long time about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his swallow 无异 to the sun , and the vulnerable individual for me , it &apos;s too big . 
this is a completely twisted people self cognitive achievement , and for people to expand expect that was completely straight up twisted , one of the self cognition , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists kill , i think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists beating . 
if this is really , at least , i think that &apos;s what we now the question is : how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 off the rational 500多年 developed the ideas we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes 抹杀 off the 500多年 developed rationality . 
well , maybe i can convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any tried to make us believe in you &apos;ve all had to sit in that experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a 雷鸣 where really breath , and the next to her .

i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s incredible , and i , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not my creative process of all , i &apos;m not a pipe , my job more like a so bad .

“ because you can see , i &apos;ve been there for the shot committed ” kept “ because you can see , i &apos;ve already committed to maintain order of no ” . 
“ if you want this book better , it &apos;s now your turn that part of them , do you work ” . 
if you don &apos;t “ to help , that you see the to ” . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to continue to write down , because it &apos;s my job . &quot; 
today , i hope that the historical record 尽责 : i got my 坚守 to € jobs today , i hope that the historical record 尽责 : i 坚守 to me . 
the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , although rarely see , but actually happens when a dancer , going beyond the when 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
time to stop the dancer , though , the time to stop the dancer like across the movement , and what he did before 1000场 performance isn &apos;t anything different , but everything was amazingly unified up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life , from the inside , light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human his life , from the inside , light , light from the bottom , he was sacred shine . 
and people , clearly know what it is , they can make it was called the name of the people , clearly know what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing wondrous give , people will pull 喝彩 欧 “ : oh , oh , 嘞 嘞 欧 , pull , really great , great ” incredible , which is good , there emerge . 
well , this way , because this is what we need . 
for artists , the most intractable is the next morning , 悠悠 dancers to turn up for artists , the most intractable is 悠悠 dancer and the next morning , that is up on a tuesday morning 11 , he with good , there is no god . 
and when it &apos;s that bad leg , are going to the old people , and he might , you couldn &apos;t get the height of the last night . 
someone would probably never 喝彩 god , in his dancing with his good , there is , how do they ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most painful for my self cognitive . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most painful for my self , understanding of this is a very tricky issues , which is the most painful for my self cognitive . 
but maybe we would have pain , so if you were never thought , that wonderful work of art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
气馁 “ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t have to do good , just that part of your ” . 
气馁 “ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t have to do good , just that part of your ” . 
the jobs in your 坚守 , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
the jobs in your 坚守 , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , it &apos;s dancing . 
if you didn &apos;t , that you keep 坚守 dancing , jobs , and i still 喝彩 嘞 欧 : for you . 
if you didn &apos;t , that you keep 坚守 dancing , jobs , and i still 喝彩 嘞 欧 : for you . 
i believe that we have to teach this one . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
at ted in 2009 , al gore shows the new situation , global climate trend that more than a scientist , and he was worried that “ for ” clean coal . 
al gore for recently climate trends . 
last year , i &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the equivalent of the size of south america by 48 state 缩减 40 percent of the area . 
but it didn &apos;t fully that this problem . because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s a good global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 change . 
red is 冻 permanent ice 
you see , it &apos;s in a dark blue here is a year in annual 冻 permanent ice in summer , ice . 
冻 permanent ” “ what that means is , five or longer form of ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood 各部 guy in the body to move . 
in the 25 years , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect 受热 冻土 around the arctic ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of this carbon 冻 by 干冰 and compost microbes 解冻 -- when methane , carbon . 
now , if the dots , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the lake light in alaska in already you can see the 沼气 探头 water . 
last winter , the university of katey walter 结队 professor alaska to a light lake . 
wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
the reason , there &apos;s a sink , which is a heat heating . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it has to 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand how the land make ice melts , sea levels rising 入海口 here it is . 
here are 急速 in traffic . 
the other side of the earth antarctica , the largest ice on the planet . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s on 20 feet of sea level , and greenland . 
the third largest ice in the himalayas , in the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
the global financial water from 40 to 50 percent of the water . 
in the ice 安第斯 mountains , this is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
the snow in california , sierra 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
it &apos;s in the dry to fire in numbers . 
and the number of disasters , it &apos;s quite unprecedentedly with absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years in time , to the earlier 七十五年 总数 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at the history , you can see what happens . 
every day in the past five years we 七千万吨 increasing co2 emissions 两千五百万吨 co2 to the oceans . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america in india , to the west 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
most of the greenhouse effect , except for 20 percent of forest destruction is burning fossil fuels . 
oil , coal most urgent is very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
one solution was to use more coal carbon planet . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see the change . 
here &apos;s some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative 
so now , in our country -- but there is a political war . 
oil and coal carbon and 两千五百万美元 spent the last year to promote clean coal that &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
before and after christmas in my hometown , tennessee digging up of billions of 淤泥 coal . 
can you see in the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest put water up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
this is a coal carbon industry . 
coal is happy and mr. cool happiness avatar . 
in the united states , you can see his fertile more productive , he also help us develop economies 
coal mr. cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia 产地 the coal . 
most of the head of mining coal is massey 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and now one of the work of two projects . 
this is one part of one of them . 
coalergy in very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of explaining the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , coal not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , don &apos;t worry about global warming and for 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal factory . 
machine 喧哗 some spectacular . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal to global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated of clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution can handle economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , the climate crisis 
will the crisis of strings together is that we are based on carbon as dirty oil products on the coal and import oil 
but now , there &apos;s a new solutions to solve this problem . 
america repower with 100 percent with a clean electricity . 
americans new work to get to our lives more safe , and let the earth was warming . 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
to understand more repower america . 
the last one . 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
in the old oil and dirty murder our planet , and this is something we reduce to rely on the fastest way . 
the future is here . wind energy , solar energy , a new network . 
the new big investment , create more money . 
repower . it &apos;s time to america &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go away , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go away , and fast . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables show -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember about being a kid you &apos;re ever in playing with legos . 
when you idea how to build with legos and to doing it , is you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is the object is to understand and 空间结构 perception . 
understand 空间结构 objects around a lot of really helps us to learn things . 
and that question would be in my mind , so we decided to find answers to have this , so siftables will . 
simply siftable said , with a computer , it &apos;s like a cookie size . 
you can bring siftables 每块 , hand siftable can move each other senses each other , and move siftable 每块 , monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information with tools . 
this individual with tools , more and more sensitive to each other senses , feel any with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
it &apos;s 映 siftable like this , if i put it on to tilt , so that &apos;s what it in this picture , maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe , then images , maybe in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables to each other senses . 
if you give them a 挨 out a good , interesting is going to happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they &apos;re also aware , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves with each other , maybe . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use gestures siftables and interact with it , for example , like the color from a liquid that siftable pour siftable one another . 
if you look at the demo , there &apos;s three dollars a barrel paint set siftables model , we can put these colors pour water in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it more , you can go back and some . 
siftables and learning a function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to learn from these functions 快捷 become much more quickly , see the results . 
and i &apos;m here to show you why -- and siftables . this is working with a simple equation , i made of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble boggle and remix together words game . 
this can play games together words , roughly , as the , you just take a letter with siftable , when you put a letter siftables 几块 together siftables of words , it would look at the word itself in the dictionary . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spelling out to change the sequence of that , the words , you can also trying to build new in other words , the letters . 
so now . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , that &apos;s some kids are in the media lab because siftables involved in the test experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is playing games together words that when we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them together , this is a game “ ” words , when they know how to do this . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the bottom right corner this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now the screen , that &apos;s an animation function interact try . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the child &apos;s felix . 
he can put some new images to add elements on it , he can do is put table towards siftables pick up a video animation images vote , can bring these new element to put it on . 
see , he added up to the sun . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
orange tractors . 
do good . 
in animation siftables to shake images that can make a new element to add to the new element . he put up -- 吠 dogs . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of story , and he plans to develop stories plot . 
sitting balloon cat off . 
and i &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function , but in 编排 , playing music is siftables , we &apos;ve developed this feature into sound domain , can make the and bess and 超载 like the sound of a drum . 
every tiles 四档 have to change , but 任君 choice . 
you can put sound siftable tiles . the voice of the modules siftable joined by the way you like . 
to put sound to sound just come close to edit module . 
there &apos;s a sound like a 响器 , which works siftable module . 
voice to those tiles tiles can adjust to sound . 
so , we can use to control the overall rhythm and volume of the modules siftable siftable come close to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
the first started 超载 put into the two tiles , and then add some 超载 sounds . 
now 贝斯音 join . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to filter acoustic tile near drums tiles , that you can adjust sound . 
i &apos;m going to rhythm and pace up some just come close to edit module . 
now , and then bring a voice to the tiles tiles shellfish filter voice . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so you don &apos;t need to have 编排 playing in real time , but when you play , but long text . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to play , with the entire volume tiles on the left to edit tiles , in this place . 
so now . thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we &apos;re doing in the lab . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and the technology , it &apos;s going to change this world with innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
