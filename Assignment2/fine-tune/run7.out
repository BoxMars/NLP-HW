through rapture images and stories , for national geographic the explorers by wade davis celebrate aboriginal culture , the great diversity , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same kind of adaptive . 
we are born in 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl , sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 , so we need to sing and dance with 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture song and dance rhythm rhythm , has unique . 
all these communities show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking different 人生观 and . 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different thinking makes you see hope . 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 a by mental life and culture intertwined in life , and the internet is that the earth for the earth &apos;s 芸芸众生 with very important point as we call the internet as the biosphere . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity logo is a very strong , we have the ability to look at the species . 
as far as the biosphere by the community was facing in the same shorter destruction , and it faster . 
this one of the most important is that language . 
we live on this planet , there were six : 00 different languages . 
language is not just be pronounced and grammar . 
language is the human spirit shining 
it &apos;s the mental actually unique culture in the material world 承 dictionary . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a mental ecosystems , long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know that the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we in the same number of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no meaning to 传人 unless it works they will completely gone . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . you can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our ancestors for kids don &apos;t predict the future of how this would be alone and scary . 
another scary thing on earth is about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 and this is a language with old . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore this ethnic loop loop to make you in a big to understand and make you personally feel are die civilization . 
it &apos;s a lot of people who have already forgot the front , and i said “ different way of living ” i said to ” “ different . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 of pulling played methuselah areas that they called the 蚺 race because they believe that this is from the time they 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
this of groups people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because the jungle their 栖身 of , so they seem to the forest canopy 天穹 with no difference . 
they said , with a strange language , a unique and follow the rules that linguistics 通婚 called 异族 通婚 one to the people with a different languages married . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage . you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . a 大家族 often 六七种 language is you never see 操练 language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i was exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 to one of the most amazing race in 1958 years earlier , i was with that they had to peace . 
five missionary 1957 years to approach them , but those who made a fatal mistake . 
they have in the next eight to 十张 they himself in the picture , we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think these people living in 雨林中 never seen two-dimensional . 
they pick up from the forest to get over these pictures and images , trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to devil card , so they use with spears 戮 dead that five evangelist . 
more terror is not only at 华拉尼 戮 people died . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent death population was their 戮 dead people . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the more people out of the 年迈 . it &apos;s going to wood , they will die for him , he 戮 送终 
on the other hand , they have astonishing for bush 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell predator 40 step , animals smell urine several hundred yards away , and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the secret i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark have magic . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
voodoo individual beauty in life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
the soul in life . 
the dance with the rhythm can 大水 翩翩起舞 to the soul of just replace the soul of life in the short shining 侍僧成 for the moment . 
so voodoo believers , like to say , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re in a cathedral , dance . 
you &apos;ve been household gods . how that will get hurt ? 
i was exposed to all of the community in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 of 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is the tyranny in ancient civilization descent , they were once conquered and filled out the columbia coast in plain 此后 they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody ethnic 肆虐 continent that has never been the spaniards . 
and today , along with that they 续 monks institutions to govern , but their monk 训诫 very unique 
they like to go back to the 母腹 are taught the values . these are the values that maintain believer relationship with the universe we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it beautiful . 
they call themselves for 兄长 call for our 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to create a very important . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain shelter , or god is a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s a symbol that this is a relationship with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia as local people &apos;s thoughts . i think , is to forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultural created a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this is a picture i this past august northwest on amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 dead on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often use psychedelic drugs . it &apos;s made -- on the water . 
this plant is a potent the color is it with the brain in five -- 羟 color is 成份 very close . 
亚诺马 jamie tribe from five people will have -- is 羟 color , plants extract the nose , and it took crack . 
if you use a nose sucked into the powder 光怪陆离 hallucinations , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you , but not distorted were totally wiped out 
but the color is matter doesn &apos;t oral because they &apos;re going to be human organ that is called a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have to change and oral list is 氧化酶 live other chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that this 藤本植物 of β 咔 啉 there -- the list is able to control 氧化酶 and play the color is working 不由得 , so you have to ask myself . 
when we do all kinds of experiments keep making errors and measure . 
but if you ask indians , they would say that plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is they &apos;re all in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to a hierarchy is how these plants and they said , &quot; i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not for plants have to say is , i don &apos;t know 
so i told you , if they said in the months circle night in the things that grow every plant to use the different little , singing to you . 
this , that &apos;s not going to get at harvard university ph.d. , but it than 报表 calculus is more fun . 
now . we have this question , and some of us indigenous that compassion something they 丰富多彩 离群索居 life , but as we world moving forward , these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been a new way of living as strong 
this is not technology . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is the great sioux nation and the american people to go and sit 骑马 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat race 完整性 layer is not change or technological innovation , it &apos;s the power of all those he robust . 
let &apos;s look at of tibet recently where i made a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the same , but by denounce genocide endangered cultures , which is the destruction of the way people live without denounce 行径 by in many places it even be a part of this strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese people immediately , he was killed . 
his uncle and other together into nepal fled . 
his mother 富农 family because 成份 and be 关押 . 
and he and his mother , only two 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and be 学习班 into . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the president of your hair 臂章 and to be about seven years of a nation 劳教 guilty . 
the pain of tibet for people to take human redemption mental need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity . 
think about it , we have in the world , the 10,000 year is in this makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 revolution human time to go to the top of the agricultural age we seed girl erotic 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra of 祭 cheese for we created level 社会分工 . it &apos;s 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial social only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to make that we have the ability to solve the challenges facing 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 a different . 
in the songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the mountain . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 whale call that the people i talk to a about his grandfather legendary story . 
in the 1950s canada government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we put them to make 定居点 away by . 
this is the old man refused to move . 
his family worrying about security , and he put all the weapons and tools are taken away . 
you know , inuit people fear them cold , this is god alone , thick . 
they sledge . the first slide in north america 鹿皮 冻 caribou package of a fish . 
this is a man and don &apos;t fear of the night and blizzard 凛冽 . 
he slept outside wearing his seal 长裤 he took skin stool and they pull on stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this shit made to the edge of the blades puke 口水 and frozen after it becomes very robust and then he put in this 刀子 宰杀 a dog . 
the skin 剥 dog made a 挽具 he and his dog made out of a dog sleds to another to between when that don &apos;t have to do it in the shit ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 make life . 
in many ways . it &apos;s inuit people in the world , all indigenous 顽强 real 写照 resilience . 
1999 four months to canada than the size of california and texas area 之和 to the land returned back to inuit people . 
i &apos;m our new home , it &apos;s called le , new dimension 
this is a independent territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is very good example , a country that could do something to do with the repair that relationship . 
and finally , i think for ever in the world , some remote people actually doesn &apos;t remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent branches of human imagination dates back to the origin of the ancient times for all of our people , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream is to the world as part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and do things , which is that we don &apos;t make politicians . 
we think dh : argument is not to convince people we think about , but in fact , you can make the world , so we could get to change the world &apos;s at the institutions of the month our website click up to the three of thousands of five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software that could change the way we see digital images . use online pick from a static image , photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and it can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is so many many gb 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , they can continue to do and smooth zoom in , by the way you can mapping through them , you can do to rearrange them . 
whether it can see how many images of data , how big the and image how big , seadragon have these processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system only factor is just , you can use a screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , the data is an image . 
this is what the dickens had 荒凉 山庄 , &quot; is chapter three content . 
i gave you prove that this is really not text and images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture of 张大 opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version of itself contains proportion of the images , reading , and people would get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in this &quot; the guardian &quot; to a corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you see a normal commercial resolution higher , in a lot of extra images into the content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to use a screen is actually limits . 
we want this technology will reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , which is use digital maps of one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you about this . we &apos;ve made their contributions . 
these are just the nasa geospatial basis . 
to 叠加 process and get the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go about their experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merge with two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from the university of washington graduate noah snavely are going to work with computer vision . this research , i get washington university seitz steve . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet we &apos;ve got , it &apos;s based on building seadragon technology . 
you can see , we have many pictures back to the way , to see that image of a subtlety 剖析 and how to have resolution experience . 
but these pictures , at the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure if we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples than this space and strong sense . 
mainly because we made it to the website , take care of the law . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by in space 串联 up . 
and then we can easily , so the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this , and to really be happy . 
i think you can see the these images from a lot of different camera phones , from the cameras to the professional alone . so a lot of different quality images , all in this environment was put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors 大头 contains the pictures , etc . 
i remember this should have a sequence of images -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to see in the poster to rebuild the environment . 
the point here ? is that effectively , we can use the internet community . we can get from everybody &apos;s data will everybody environment for different memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , what a lot more than just to collect it up . 
this is a model , however , the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people to use and become complex , and become more valuable . 
user picture , you will be the 注 labels . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand that correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software that really means is to explore . 
it &apos;s in between the images building hypertext . 
this 接合 process . it &apos;s based on the content . 
more exciting is that contains a picture of text semantic information . 
for example , what you &apos;re in the picture , the key word later , page text will have a picture with this relevant information . 
now , that all these pictures and images to you , that would ? 
and so these semantic information to each other , and a link in is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think here to talk about this book , i hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know exactly what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a the standard principles about it . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 笃信 疑 principles . 
this is to say , well , if we allow people to get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is this thing in the freedom to is that good and valuable , for people to do . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can 做主 using their various ways the big enough to get welfare , people i don &apos;t have to 做主 for them . 
freedom to make a way that is the largest increase selective limits . 
people more choices , which more freedom , freedom , getting more and more the welfare of that . 
i think , like this idea that 掺 into the water that age-old in that nobody would want to ask questions about it . 
this is the same ideas deep embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples look at the social progress . let &apos;s be possible to do something . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
i just want to say salad ingredients here . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one and a pop-up stores it sound system -- voice box for cd machine , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s one in a pop-up stores sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
in the components of this , you can have last 650万种 out of the things pop-up sound system . 
you can &apos;t don &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a bunch of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid , you want to refer to was telephone service , which had to go to the company , just a bell it . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s not going to die at all bad . 
that day are 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially . now , phones that cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
and i &apos;d 津津乐道 is in the middle -- that will take mp three the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t in the next to your store seen it , don &apos;t worry , with no . how do you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people went to the store , and you ask : is there a not so much with function ? &quot; 
you want to answer is , what ? 
answer is no ” “ . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a not so many things to do the phones . 
the same in life , the other day , we produce more than to affect the things that the same choice , up there . 
health care -- in the united states , now that you are not to the doctor , doctors straightforward tell you how to do era . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
for a very nail and so forth and risk . 
for a very 乙 and so forth and risk to treat . you do ? 
and you say , “ doctor , should i do ” how ? 
they said , again , a very nail these risks 乙 there , and those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you pick ” that ? 
they said , “ , but i don &apos;t you ” is . 
now the prescription over the ad is for you , these people with me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said , if we can &apos;t just can &apos;t think a 柜台 to buy . 
why should we do have to market ? 
answer is , they want to look at the advertising , and the next morning would go to your doctor , the phone to put on a prescription drugs in their . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now our gender , not from my parents inherit down there , but to invented by themselves . 
so we can what have you back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up for you to do today , you want to do a kind of men and women and . make a decision . 
in the marriage of in the family , everybody &apos;s got married age that is almost thing , and of course , is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
you need only choice is , and who are not married , and when i , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and now it , everything that can take 挑拣 拣 pick . 
i teach a bunch of smart students good , but now i give them all placed homework time less than one fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they than ever before -- and the students stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask yourself : i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t married ? is going to now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re doing , i don &apos;t do all placed homework , whether they in my class . take a grades . 
they really need to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now do work , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day , any time in the earth a work in the corner -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place to wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you are . 
don &apos;t tell you is the reason i also wanted to use . 
anyway , we work these incredible to give us the freedom that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , for their work now that &apos;s right , and the rest . 
we go to the kid play football , in a 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 it in with their blackberry blackberry . now , and it goes on the laptop . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we still looking at in 场上 rivals for children and constantly ask ourselves , so this is not the phone ? 
go back to the email or not ? i don &apos;t have to write this an 信稿 ? 
even if you give their answer is no , you have kids that the experience of the game was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether thing was , the small things matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we live in the world is like this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
today we live in the world is this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s not good beauty . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
one , some say up an oxymoron , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us not liberating , but inside , it &apos;s paralysis . 
with so many people that have to decide , very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to do that , it &apos;s about a project to wait pension investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues have access to invest vanguard to record . vanguard is a big companies have about a foundation , millions of people , and two 000多个 office place . 
her research , that &apos;s when these customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is two percent . 
you give employees 50种 foundation , to provide people than you 5种 fund 10 percent , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 foundation to choose to decide that we do that is even more difficult , so you can actually trying on tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s preferably , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to the year of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was provide an are obsessed with this . 
so , to have the possibility of rigid is paralyzed . 
it makes us into this world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision is right , right ? 
where you really don &apos;t want to choose exactly a foundation , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
more choices , the more ridiculous things to to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make choices . 
secondly , economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today , dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have to think a lot of choice , and it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you pick up a compelling ways . and that makes you always right . you see the think 美中不足 . 
for example , that -- and it , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is what you should think right now . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
gorgeous , the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
you can better than that ? that &apos;s it like this in “ huh , really , it &apos;s bad ” “ in august , ” . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home , ” 
“ i want to go back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day 念叨 lost in the parking , of the best chance . 
“ opportunity cost to ” always we &apos;ve decided to make a decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite 英明 . 
we have options these options , the more attractive . it &apos;s more , and all these things become opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for . 
it also say the “ live in the ” this idea . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , in a sense is , when you chose to do something that , you also have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing you tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
the point in time , i have to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time , enough to wash over a million times , pants to become 凑合 . 
so that , in many years old , i finally pants 上街 to buy a new . i said , “ feed , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , , or 宽松 , ? 
the first to 扣子 and drag locked ? 石磨 and acid with ? 
to a kind of fast them ? 
and the back , and it &apos;s mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw , almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i asked , “ i &apos;m going to that used to be the only kind of ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i can take a me the most 合身 pants out of the door . 
i don &apos;t do it wrong . those choices that i have to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? for this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is because there &apos;s so much as i can choose , for a jeans what should have much good to be a good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i didn &apos;t expect a lot . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least a is the best 极致 perfect . 
it &apos;s really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i take i had to and i want to do , and i expect more than this one up , i became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together in a choice , except for things to people about what a great outside expectations doesn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just to make people and less happy , even though it &apos;s a good results . 
to market there &apos;s nobody to understand this , because if they know there &apos;s people , and you don &apos;t have the opportunity to know what does that mean a cartoon . i mean . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in everything very bad and everything is better than now . 
and the reason is that when a normal things are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , in our these rich , industrial civic life in the world , perfect . it &apos;s of course , for every object the more you only want it worse than you would expect . 
you will not be what you know what , because i than my high expectations and . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
but now , i think a little bit of time . you talk about myself , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans choices for you , you buy a back , don &apos;t think you happy , and ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
there was hundreds of out on the jeans , you don &apos;t put things excuse f it up . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be very good , and they were so disappointed to decide -- , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world and -- if the industrialized world , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like the from ago . 
i remind you . 
the choice , happiness , and that -- well , the standard , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
of course , there &apos;s choose not to better than choice , but not conclusion that choice more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we actually ‘ choice ’ needs , the key . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that have so many choices , is a material , good . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least , we heard a few of them , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic modern western societies are on a special issue . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday said , incredible 气愤 question is , we make those expensive and it &apos;s the car seats babies 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , these expensive and complicated . it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us harm . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and fix it . 
products redistribution will allow all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , the fish , know what ? 
tell you , in this fish , everything is in the ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think , the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible to break the fish , you have not freedom , but paralyzed , &#91; fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible to break the fish , you &apos;re down happiness . 
you increase the is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a fish that “ ” . 
in this fish -- and you know , for this fish , maybe a little bit , for us , it &apos;s almost too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish that is going to suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new design in biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” , i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try to understand in different levels . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now , we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to go to the . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , and it was from biology and entered the world , the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , we could build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a microbial sequence picture , mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got a species for me , the smallest genome in the lab to make it replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 genes from the 一百组 separate out is that our current these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study is synthetic chromosomes , so that we can change its of questions to keep the fundamental problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic ? ” chromosome . 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never make a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way down , just some without live sexual chemistry . 
we digital life constantly exponential faster and faster . 
our genetic code to write the progress very slow to it , but it was accelerating . we recently , what &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact , it took me through the stages . we do in the first trial ago , i have a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it &apos;s synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world in a 十几万台 device make little pieces of dna , in 30 to 50 character , and this is a regression process , created the long time , that &apos;s much more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions and put together all wrong . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 genome bacteriophage digital information and -- the beginning . 
it &apos;s a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it gene pieces , and it wrong , you have a symbol of 5,000 of dna . 
and the most exciting . when we put this video there we go live chemicals into the bacteria , the bacteria started reading the genetic code , made a virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli &#91; 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , i think they to understand this model very well . 
he was laughing , more than you out loud . 
so we think this is actually software to build a biological system in their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re using digital information on a computer . that those numbers have very accurate information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , gene sequencing , right , the standard is basically every 10,000 for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , the sequence is wrong , on average , 30 . if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design work is the design of 50 character and the length of time and other 50 character long piece 叠加 to build smaller units , . we have to design , they get together . 
and we have a design of the unique . 
you may have heard about us to 水印 in one . 
you see there are four character genetic code , a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 -- the body and the character 编成 about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we made these snippet and can use to cut enzyme 裁 . some enzymes are used to repair and they put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , 7000 character from the beginning of time to put them together to make people 24 , ask the length of time to time and 几组 merger , 72 people into a long time . 
in every stage , we grow a piece of these , so we can give them -- because we wanted to create a very reliable process in a minute , you &apos;ll see 
we try to automate level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece , over 100 people in their basic when it &apos;s hard to keep in e. coil in a long , long . try to do in the modern tools of molecular biologist in , we turn to other ways . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology to repair , using dna , it can put together to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a little radiation that is able to withstand 球菌 三百万度 radiation amount . 
you can see on top of the images , its chromosomes , nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s going to assemble themselves back and before the original . 
we have this can have 千种 . 
these are completely out of that water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has ever shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a we take this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is mentioned yeast in front of the way , and we put it right , design pieces . yeast aggregates automatically them . 
it &apos;s not an image microscopic ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
these are , long about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open recent experiment results . 
it &apos;s over 580000 character long genetic code . it &apos;s by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t have to find 10号 distance to print out to the . total 142页 to print the genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is a very simple process bacteria more complicated . 
do we really are like that nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we know we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell move on to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we &apos;re trying to design this process into some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve had a second of all species or from elsewhere , the third side chromosomes in a second 数千种 new increased features to its own . 
what used by people in the process of evolution , and just have a genetic change the perception ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes can be digesting the dna . 
what the that cells don &apos;t think this enzyme there , and when we add in a have this enzyme chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a contains a new dna . 
we put it into a gene causing blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original . all species disappear , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins are membrane changed , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , in fact , is that we implanted . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we really can shift to dramatically , through dna to change things . 
now , i want to say it &apos;s not invasive century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we do need for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
our population will in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to every one of us from 1946 , is the people in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people to provide food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
in nine billion people in that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil . it &apos;s 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about the biological process or any can replace the program , it &apos;s a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , this is the material that was in the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
and we found from around the world . there &apos;s a contains about 两千万组 genetic database , and i like to use them as the future of design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to a components , so let &apos;s get diversity . 
now , our main limited from reality in biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because these can make “ mix of what we call the ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can start to survive , to choose , chemical production , or fuel vaccine production , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit down , really work in the computer to design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what their genetic code looks like . 
we &apos;re on the attention “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you see the recent corn ethanol is going into a bad experiment . 
soon we will have a second and third generations fuel . that &apos;s sugar into higher fuel 辛烷 or value for different kinds of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
sunlight and co2 is one of the way -- 
so -- so -- -- but we &apos;ve found in the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a , was in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep . about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
if we look at to collect the two really , no , it &apos;s very easy to stand , can be introduced into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we may increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic question understanding . 
we really have replace the oil industry 化工 little goals . and -- now , if you can &apos;t do that in ted , where there are probably ? as a major energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tool making a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see this all happened flu , we tend to slow the time of year , and in this case , they really useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , and , as an artificial 古物 of bacteria , and it &apos;s nuclear biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , it can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 ted u short of the presentation , brian cox shares some which super 对撞机 news , including . what are doing the repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out of what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to it . it is the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state , every second 6亿次 and make the state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these for some camera that little big bang . 
this is that , i worked at this atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this one . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters picture of the particles go around like the lhc . we &apos;re planning with the lhc . and , in a part of the particles that 辐 go flying off . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know this got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people to see icons like google front page . 
this suggests that we work with a shock to culture that it &apos;s also a scientific shock . 
but about a week later , we created a major machine error with these 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 and they start when the machine . 
now some of you might say engineers “ impossible , too little ” those wires . 
they can do , because when it &apos;s very low them into superconducting 导线 . 
so at minus 271摄氏度 than between the temperature of the planet space circumstances these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 have put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise , it is a little bit of transmission of 安培 suddenly they and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnets up to 20 tons . they move about a ruler miles . 
there are about 50 magnet . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , to get the data and continue our mission to find out of the most basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but that &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task still with us for the fact that my itself , it &apos;s value in the lhc . 
thank you .

i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and i was the love of obsessed with life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a special event , however , recently , in my life work , a specific event happened that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
and it turns out , and no matter where people are , i think this is the result is that life , and i , or where people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , play 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very to come up with , and i said , “ . you don &apos;t you ? no . this is not in my life beyond the book ” ? 
they can just get one ! &quot; 
i was around in the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you &apos;re afraid of going to continue to collapse , you say ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of dying in despair , with the failed 苦痛 i was always get to that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : ” “ . 
yes , all this kind of scary until today , the same thing . 
yes , all this kind of scary until today , the same thing . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people think that &apos;s not something beyond that , i &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , talking about fear of writing , i have been thought , why would i fear of writing ? but , talking about fear of writing , i have been thought , why would i fear of writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear destined doing their job ? this logical fear ? people in their own destiny ? this logical work ? 
nobody said , “ john , chemistry met bottleneck work ? how ? ” . 
never would happen this question . 
of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer a group that doesn &apos;t in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early years of a century of creative genius , the great 英年早逝 examples are just look at the early years of a century , the great geniuses in which they 英年早逝 case is often age lightly died since . 
even if the suicide often , no , no completely out of their talent , not even if the suicide , often doesn &apos;t completely out of their talent exhibited 
and the 曼梅 le died , in front of the last one interview i said , “ every one of the book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
for your life &apos;s work , this is how radical statement . 
i want to ask all of you is , you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you is , you have no dispute about that ? 
all of you think this sentiment ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of a little bit further 臆断 even to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断 
this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this idea , and not only 可憎 horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century , but the point 可憎 , and horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative genius , they continue to be alive . 
and i , myself , believed that i certainly going into the dark 绝境 and for me , believed that i certainly going into the dark 绝境 especially now in my career , especially at stage in my career . 
you see , i was young , i came to 40 years old , you know , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for career 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i said that in my heart , and it really possible , and i &apos;ve ever had the biggest successes . 
oh my god , what is this idea . 
is this idea , makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine on the road , not just this idea , makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine on the road , no . i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : should i do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : should i do ? 
and deep thinking about it , in my opinion to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance , the difference between writing , and i work extreme concern for responses from itself , and i started writing for responses extreme anxiety . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because we &apos;re going around the back . 
in ancient greece and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the ancient greek and human in ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the ancient greek and human in ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred to from distant djinn , and you know where artists around here , with a remote and you know from distant and purpose is to know where all the artists , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks universal to call this a with creativity to for the djinn “ 守护神 ” 
and people often think socrates , there &apos;s such a 守护神 , from a distance , he was giving people think that general wisdom and socrates is such a 守护神 , give him from a distance . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of create djinn “ genius called ” the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called ” “ genius 
this view brilliant people , because i didn &apos;t think ” “ genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view brilliant people , because i didn &apos;t think ” “ genius is a very personal 聪慧 . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people 成败 from work on protecting mechanism . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
ancient artist by this idea , and get to protect the narcissism artists of ancient by this point and get to protect , excessive narcissism . 
if you work great . it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass ” “ genius with the help . 
if you work , so it &apos;s also not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ ” very bad genius . 
this is in the western for a long time thinking about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , this for vulnerable individual , is too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of cognitive , and for people to make this incredibly expanding this completely straight up twisted , one of cognitive , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of kill artist and i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think is this so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them with understanding of human creativity ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them with understanding of human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use 18 minutes is a short talk , developed 500多年 抹杀 out of the reason we don &apos;t mind with a short talk , the 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 better human . 
maybe i can convince you all agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make people believe that there are things that you had this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal , 雷鸣 breath in , and she really . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is going to her power 撼动 feet into the ground . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is going to her power 撼动 feet into the ground . 
now , when she was the only thing to do only one thing with her words , is to “ 死命 狂奔 ” 
in other , and this is called me the most amazing part : in other , and this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail 顺势 and put it back on the other hand , it will poetry 誊写 on paper 顺势 and put it back on the other hand , it will poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on the order of it is upside down , from the beginning , the last word go by , and , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like , is amazing , and it &apos;s my creative process . it &apos;s not exactly the same of course , and all the creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 , and as i have to get an incredible inspiration , but even 古板 , and as i have to get an incredible . 
there may have a lot of people like .

what &apos;s going on here ?

i hope this record that : i 尽责 to 坚守 my jobs € today i want to record that : i 坚守 尽责 to me . 
that &apos;s wonderful performance , because they &apos;re great professional dancer who show a wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer 
occasionally , although very unlikely , but actually happen at a dancer going beyond the 出世 transcendent experience when . 
you know , i should say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
it seems to stop , dancer like a kind of the time to stop , across the dancer like he did movement and 1000场 performance before and no difference , but everything , it was miraculous unity . 
刹那间 , he is not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he is not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was the shine sacred . 
now , clearly people know what it is , they can call it the name of the time , people know exactly what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing for the magic , people will pull “ 喝彩 : oh , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 , oh , great -- really , really great , an incredible ” that is good , there emerge . 
this is a good way , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky , is the next morning , dancer 悠悠 turned up for the most tricky for artists , is the next morning , dancer 悠悠 turned up tuesday morning , that &apos;s 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
and just the legs , when bad old you are going to people , maybe , and he couldn &apos;t get that at last night . 
maybe never in his when somebody dance 喝彩 god with his good , there should be , how are they ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
this is a very tricky issues creative process , which is the most painful cognitive of self , it &apos;s a very hard question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
but maybe we were all suffering , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re dancer , which dancing . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re dancer , which dancing . 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach this one . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 ! 
in 2009 , al gore on the ted showed the world &apos;s new is that trend , climate scientists , more than a remarkable , and he worried that for ” “ clean coal . 
al gore recently trend for the climate . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last thing in the area of the equivalent of the american south 48 state area 缩减 a 40 percent . 
but they can that not all of this problem . because it doesn &apos;t represent the ice cap thickness . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years really 剧 . 
red is 冻 permanent ice 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue is into this year in the winter of ice in the summer 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or a longer the ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect of the arctic ocean around 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s lots of being 冻 an carbon 干冰 . and 解冻 , microbial compost methane , carbon . 
if you break a greenhouse gas emissions , it &apos;s going to the atmosphere of global warming pollution amount . 
in alaska lake has some light in the water , you can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
wow . 
she &apos;s ok , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , north deposition a heat greenland heat . 
this is a year of melting . 
but it than traffic 往年 are . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq greenland . 
if you want to understand the land on how to make ice melts , sea levels rising and here it is 入海口 . 
here are 急速 up in traffic . 
antarctica , the other side of the planet in the ice . 
last month , the entire continent report , scientists are in decline of the ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
so that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the water from the financial gain half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , this is the ice , the urban drinking water . 
traffic was . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , assuming is very serious . 
global dry . was fire in that number . 
and the world &apos;s population in time is absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years , 总数 in time to the first four times more 七十五年 总数 . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we day 七千万吨 co2 emissions up to the ocean 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
look at the ocean area from east to west in america , india was 两边 含氧量 in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of the big reasons , except , of forest destruction burn oil fuel is 20 percent . 
oil , coal most urgent very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution was to build a more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s some recently discovered the and some new green alternative 
but now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political . 
and carbon and coal oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth in my hometown , tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
you probably saw in the news . 
and here is the second largest waste , put them up . 
and the before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a coal industries that carbon . 
coal is cool , happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile productive and more and help us develop economies 
coal cool day in , it becomes more clean 
he sanctuary workers cute , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , the coal 产地 
the biggest is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and is one of al gore . and now this of two projects . 
this is one , one part of the 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal mining coal and explaining the truth . 
in fact , coal , not dirty 
we think it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , don &apos;t for global warming and . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plants . 
some spectacular machine 喧哗 ! 
but this is technology clean coal . 
and the coal burning is causing global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look at it . this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , climate crisis 
these are going to the strings together , we &apos;re based on carbon for oil products on are like the coal and import oil 
but now , there &apos;s a new solutions to solve these problems . 
repower america with 100 percent renewable electricity with a time . 
and you get to the new work that we live more safe , and it was not warming earth 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the last one . 
this is about repower america . 
old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to the less dependent on the fastest way . 
the next here . wind and solar and new energy . 
new investment to create the big more money . 
repower america &apos;s wishes come true . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- think of a toy . 
first of all , i want you to remember that in the age of being a kid you played kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos , and to do , is you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that really helps us 空间结构 around for a lot of learning things . 
this would be questions , and in my mind , so we decided to get the answer , so it will have this siftables . 
simply said , siftable . it &apos;s a computer , as a cookie size . 
siftables can use my hands , just move 每块 siftable can perceive moves each other , each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as with legos could randomly . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- is this digital information tools . 
these tools , with more and more sensitive to each other , senses , feel any with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows images in here , and maybe if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe that image tilted towards the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you put them a 挨 a out ok , interesting thing will happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves , and maybe each other . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that down to from a different color siftable into a siftable . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel with paint siftables model , we can put these barrels color pour in the middle of the color that , which together . 
if it , and how can go back a few . 
siftables and learning machine function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions learning 快捷 , to become more quickly see it . 
this is what i &apos;m here to siftables reason -- and this is working . i used to make a simple equation of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix games together . &quot; 
this &quot; play games together in a way , as the next , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter 几块 siftables together to make words , siftables in the dictionary automatically find the words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell it turns out that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
&#91; applause . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here &apos;s some kids are in the media lab because in the test siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this &quot; play games together , we don &apos;t need to explain what they . 
just to tell them , and this is a word “ together ” game , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen on other people to experience siftables . 
the bottom right corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now , on the screen that is an animation to function interact . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
and this is the child felix . 
he can put some new add elements to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards images that video animation vote , can bring these new add to the elements animation . 
see , he to add up to the sun . 
the sun it up . 
david and he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
and to shake siftables animation images that can make a new element . he put into the new elements to add up -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open-source end story , and he was planning on plot how stories . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function and 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables this function in terms of sound , can make like 超载 tone and bess and drum voice . 
and there &apos;s tiles 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable the sound of the sound of the modules into the siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there &apos;s this 响器 , which filter , the sound effects siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles come close to sound can adjust the sound . 
so , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume siftable near the tiles tiles siftable to change the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the two tiles 超载 into edit , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now , the voices were drums filter to modules , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to just accelerated pace of the rhythm near the tiles module . 
now to put sound to filter tiles shellfish tiles . the filter . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have , but 编排 playing , over time , you can play a text . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
&#91; applause . thank you . 
as you see , my vision is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable , our next is a study in the lab . 
i want to talk to you with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation sophisticated technology product -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
