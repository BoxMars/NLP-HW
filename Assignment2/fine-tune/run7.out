through rapture images and stories , for national geographic exploration of by wade davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary aboriginal culture , these culture is an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same an adaptive . 
we are born in 母腹 生儿育女 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl , sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance in 排遣 life 苦楚 we create art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different perspectives will let you see hope 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by a mental life and culture and intertwined life into the internet cover the entire planet earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity signs is also a strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
as far as the biosphere by the race circles are facing the same shorter and its destruction faster 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live in the original on this planet have 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is shining human spirit . 
and it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of a conscious mind with a mental ecosystem long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we all of the same number of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no 传人 do that unless it works they will completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be talking final 本族语 people can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t allowed to predict the future of this is how lonely and scary . 
there &apos;s a terrible thing on earth about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 with , and it &apos;s an old language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore the race loop loop race to give you a rough and understand what makes you personally feel are death civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people have forgot . i said “ different way of living ” in front of me said “ ” different ways . 
for example this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 played methuselah -- the areas that they &apos;re called the 蚺 race because they believe in a time where they came from the sacred river 米尔克 东岸 was used for the snake . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because of their 栖身 forest , and so , in their opinion 天穹 with the forest canopy and no difference . 
they say , with a weird language , a unique and follow the rules that 通婚 called linguistics 异族 通婚 one person to people with a different languages , married people . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the same 异族 婚 . a 大家族 often have 六七种 language you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i &apos;ve been exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing before the genocide in 1958 years , i used to that they had to peace . 
1957 missionary five years to approach them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the sky eight to 十张 they himself in the photo we think it &apos;s kind of that , but they don &apos;t think of this living in 雨林中 who &apos;ve never seen a two-dimensional . 
they pick up from the forest these pictures and images to get over to try to find these people , but the person they nothing and they think this is a call to devil cards , so they use with spears 戮 this missionary five died . 
more terror is not only 华拉尼 戮 external people died . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is death by their own 戮 to die . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally goes out to the truth . it will be more 年迈 wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have astonishing for bush 惊诧 perspective . 
their predator can smell 40 steps several hundred yards away animals smell urine and know what that animals urine . 
in order to understand the way i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teaching is not a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions 
voodoo of the unique about it was born with the connection between them . 
born in the soul . 
the dance with the rhythm can 翩翩起舞 大水 below the soul to just replace the birth of the soul in this brief moment shining 侍僧成 for god . 
so voodoo believers , like , you go to church worship to call god . 
we dance to be in the temple . 
you &apos;ve been with household gods . why would get hurt ? 
i was exposed to all of those groups of living in colombia in the mountains of santa 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient civilization tyranny of descent , they were once conquered and takes over the columbia of the coast in plain 此后 them back to the coast plains of an isolated . 
in this bloody 肆虐 continent this race has never been the spaniards . 
and today , they get along with 续 monk would rule , but they monk 训诫 very unique . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain values is the relationship between the believers in the universe we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it beautiful . 
they call myself 兄长 call us for 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain gods of shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia , grew up with the local people thought that i think is going to affect forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this photo was me last year in august in northwest amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often used it did die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is it in the brain with five 羟 color is the 成份 very close . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribe , people are from with five 羟 color is plants extract this substance , and use his snout took crack 
if you use a nose sucked into powder that you will see 光怪陆离 hallucinations in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distort it were totally wiped out 
but the color is oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organ in a single is called 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have to change and oral alone is 氧化酶 living as other chemicals . 
and what &apos;s interesting is that this 藤本植物 in there -- β 咔 啉 right can inhibit alone is 氧化酶 and play the color is so potent you 不由得 to ask myself . 
when we do all kinds of experiments , keep making errors measure it . 
but if you ask the people who say they would say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person species found in the cane is they all die in the deep jungle in that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , i want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants are not understand me 
i tell you that if they said in months circle of the things that night 17 grow every plant to use the different little word singing to you . 
and that &apos;s not going to get your ph.d. from harvard , but it &apos;s much more accounting 报表 more fun 
dh : now we have this question , and some of us think they had the compassion indigenous life 离群索居 丰富多彩 world forward , but as we develop these people go to the status of history . 
any culture has always been new way of life as strong . 
this is not technology itself . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is great sioux nation indians and americans say goodbye 骑马 and sit 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat race loop 完整性 is not change or technological innovation , it &apos;s the power of all the words , he &apos;s robust . 
let &apos;s look at the mountains tibet recently where i do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide cultural destruction , which is destruction people lifestyle 行径 without being denounce in many places it even considered by part of this strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
chinese invasion immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believers fled to nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family 成份 and be 关押 . 
and he was only two his mother 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into his because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended behavior , and was sent to 学习班 
one day she accidentally hit has to have hair &apos;s head of the 臂章 and be guilty about seven years of a nation to accept 劳教 
the pain of tibet for people to take the human spirit redemption need access to witness 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need to a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
back up , we have in the world exist in the 10,000 year that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 era for the human into the agricultural age we seed , he went to the top of the girl 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra for cheese 祭 after we created this 社会分工 levels , and the only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
and i think this brief history have enough that we have the ability to solve the millennium facing challenges . 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to recognize that we have to make sure that all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the top . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals this whale call 奥拉雅 people to tell me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always practice inuit people to build our sovereign we &apos;re going to make them away by 定居点 . 
this old man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family worried that his security put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know inuit people fear the cold , which is their days alone , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 packet 冻 made out of the fish . 
this is a man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 blizzard . 
he slept outside wearing his skin his stool seal 长裤 to pull in hand when stool quickly become stiff , he made it into a blades . 
and then put it in a shit blades puke on the edge and 口水 frozen after it becomes very robust and then he put it in 刀子 宰杀 dog . 
the next 剥 dogs bark into a 挽具 and then he made out of his dog sleds condoms to another dog between when you don &apos;t have that the manure knife made out of the ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways . it &apos;s inuit all indigenous people around the world , the real 写照 顽强 resilience . 
april 1999 canada government to a area than texas and california &apos;s big 之和 area of land returned back to inuit people . 
i was our new home , it &apos;s called le new dimension , 
this is a separate territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is a very good shows a country can do something to think about how to fix it with the relationship between people . 
and finally , i think about the world ever some remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they are the branches of human imagination , go back to the origin of the ancient times for all of us , these kids dream with our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through national geographic and tv can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think jt debate is not to convince other people , but we think about it and get to make the world , so we can change the world &apos;s at about the institutions of the website and a click of thousands of up to three to five 百万次 
our 156 channels in a play . 
we have the magazine millions of people . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software can change the way we watch digital images from the internet . use pick out the picture , a static photosynth created an absolute brute dream of scenes , and can navigate it . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
we see here is so many many gb 千兆 byte &#93; level of digital photographs , and they can do for and smooth zoom in , you can browse through mapping the way , they can do to rearrange them . 
no matter how many have seen data sets , images have much itself and image how big seadragon , all have that kind of processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system , the only factor is just , you use the screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is dickens of all time , &quot; &quot; 荒凉 山庄 line is chapter of content . 
i gave you prove that this is really not text and images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and not a picture . 
maybe it would be an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
every single 张大 here is one of the opening . 
and the paper , or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , when people get better reading experience , reading to enjoy it . 
here we made small change in the issues to &quot; the guardian &quot; corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you just see the regular ad to a lot of high resolution , embedded in pictures of the extra content . 
if you want to see this car trait , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to avoid the screen is actually used the limit . 
we want this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , technology applications for this map is obvious , number one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you that we have to make this field for your contribution . 
these are just nasa geospatial basis . 
叠加 processing and get on the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this technology already online , you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually combined the two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from the university of washington graduate noah snavely undertake computer visual research findings . and this study got washington university steve seitz 
and of microsoft &apos;s rick szeliski help . it &apos;s a beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet has got applied , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have access to do with multiple ways of looking at , and to do with the subtlety 剖析 and have more resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually a very significant . 
i &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more environmental mapping . 
there are many examples than this space agey-ness and strong . 
mainly because when we make websites , going to take care of legal issues . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this 串联 up by in space . 
and then we so easily , but the to browse . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this , to really pretty amazing happy . 
i think you can see these images from the camera , a lot of different from the mobile phone camera into a single backwards . so a lot of different quality images , in this environment was all put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
i remember this should have a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to the poster to see the rebuilding of the environment . 
the point here ? is that we can use effectively online community with everyone . we can get data to everybody for different environmental memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , and all the secondary out to be much more than just gather up all of them . 
this model can secondary out , is the whole planet . 
this is like stephen lawler of the virtual earth &quot; long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people to use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
user picture , you will be 注 tag on . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the years to global images from 接合 together ? 
the software . this is the real meaning , is to explore . 
it builds up in the picture hypertext . 
this process is completely 接合 images based on the content . 
more exciting images that contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you can go online and with a picture , button on the page , and the text of this picture will be involved with the relevant information . 
now , suppose that image with you all the images together , that would be like ? 
and so these semantic information to each other and the capacity to link is huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
barry 施瓦茨 : the choice of time . 
i think i &apos;m here to talk about the book of content hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know exactly what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a recognized the creed of going up . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society is not a 疑 笃信 creed . 
well , this is to say this : if we allow people to get the benefits of big enough , the way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is this thing and freedom in itself is good and valuable , for people are essential . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can 做主 themselves with all the way the big enough to get welfare , people don &apos;t have to work for me were 做主 . 
and the freedom to do a lot to do is the largest increase fully selective . 
people more choices , freedom is more , the more freedom , get the benefits that the more . 
i think , the idea is like 掺 into the water that the age-old that nobody would want to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples of modern society &apos;s advance development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my house , near a supermarket . not so much . 
i just want to talk about this salad ingredients . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one to store it a pop-up sound system -- voice box conclusion , cd machine conclusion , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
with this store components that you can have a close 650万种 out of the things pop-up sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid was , you want to refer to telephone service , which had to go to the bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , the telephone is going to die are not bad . 
that day are 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially mobile . now , that cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
and i was in the middle of the most 津津乐道 -- that will take three mp play machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen it , don &apos;t worry , with no pretty soon , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the result is that people went to the store , and you ask : is there a not so much with function ? &quot; 
you want , what would answer ? 
answer is no “ ” . 
now you may not have to buy a not so many things stem cell phone . 
again , in some other life in the shopping for more than we affect the things that have the same bang existed . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , doctors straightforward tell you how to do age . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use cure nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth solution nail has happened with risk . 
and so forth 乙 solution has happened with risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , should i do ” how ? 
the psychiatrist says , again , a nail these things , and risk 乙 have those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , but i &apos;m not “ ” you . 
now the prescription drugs , all over the ad is for you and me the ordinary people . if you think about it , don &apos;t say , if we can &apos;t think a 柜台 directly to buy . 
why are we doing to their marketing campaign ? 
answer is , they wanted us to see the morning after the advertising would go to your doctor , the doctor to call the prescription drugs , they put in . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became the topic of choice . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now our gender , not from my parents inherited down there , but by ourselves to invent . 
so we could get back to what have you shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you today , you &apos;re going to do a what people are women and men &#91; the &#93; decide . 
in marriage family ways , in the last everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is of course , and that &apos;s 生儿育女 as soon as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices and who are married , and not when end , it &apos;s not married , after doing . 
and today , about everything that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
i teach a bunch of smart bright students , but now i give them all placed homework fifth time less than one . 
it &apos;s not because they now than ever before -- students stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less who . 
now the reason is their brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always ask myself , i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t marry ? is it going right now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to first child , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do all placed my homework , whether they in my class take a what grades . 
they really should go to these questions , because this is something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can day at any time , in the earth in a corner work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotels . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place to wifi , but i don &apos;t tell you the where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i also want to use . 
anyway , we work in these incredible freedom to bring us is we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now to work for himself was moved to break or so . 
we went to see when a kid play football 裤兜 with all the phone , another 裤兜 in with all their blackberry &#91; knee &#93; blackberry , or with a laptop . 
even though they are locked up , we still look at children in 场上 rivals for and constantly ask myself , i still don &apos;t pick the phone ? 
go back to the email or not ? what should i shouldn &apos;t write this was 信稿 ? 
even if you give their answer is no , you for children and the ball game experience was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether thing was , small things matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we used to live in the world like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to do . 
and today we live in the world , like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s bad beauty . 
all these choices for people , and there are two impact is two negative impact . 
one , some say up an oxymoron , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us is not liberating , but inside , is paralysis . 
with so many choices that people want to make that decision very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a story about peer-to-peer pension plan investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues had access to recorded vanguard of investment . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office place . 
her research that &apos;s when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number of that two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 foundation , people than 5种 fund down when you give 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to want to choose that it &apos;s just simply put even more difficult and you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s preferably , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to a lot of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , too many choices , possibilities , and was paralyzed rigid . 
and it allows us to the world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make decisions are the right , right ? 
there you really don &apos;t want to choose a foundation is wrong , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the more easily puzzling something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with ourselves to make choices . 
secondly , economists call “ opportunity cost ” things . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have many choices to think , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you quit the choice of interesting ways . and that makes you always chosen to you that think 美中不足 . 
for example , &#91; that &#93; comics , but if you are not new yorker , if i have a 歉 . 
but this is now you should think about . 
look at these two 口子 hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
gorgeous beach , sunlight 明媚 , they have all this . 
it can better than that ? it &apos;s now are going uh-huh “ , really bad , ” “ now is , in august ” . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home , ” 
i &apos;m going to “ is back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was tortured with this idea , every day in 念叨 lost percent and the good parking opportunities . 
“ opportunity cost ” always has enabled us to make a decision not even with these decisions are actually 英明 . 
we have the option more attractive in these options that are more , and all these things became opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also say out in the present whatsoever “ ” this principle . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step to . 
but , of a truth is , when you chose to do something , and you just have chosen not to do other things . 
the other things tend to have a lot of places , and you can undermine your doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
the point in time , i have to buy a new jeans when i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time to wash enough , a million times , after pants get 凑合 . 
so , in the many years old , i finally pants 上街 to buy the new “ . i said , &quot; hey , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and said , you &apos;re 紧身 type , the type of comfort , or 宽松 types ? 
to the front 扣子 and pull locked ? 石磨 and acid wash ? 
to just quickly grind breaking ? 
and the mouth , or the back of ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw , almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i said , i &apos;m going to “ that was the only one ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , i took a i never before the 合身 pants out the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? why this and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse , the reason is because there are so many sex , i can choose for a jeans what should have more good to be greatly good expectations rise . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a while , i didn &apos;t expect that too . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one is the best 极致 perfect . 
and that &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i took that i &apos;ve got to go and i expect compare , and i expect than me up , and it &apos;s just become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond didn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just demoralize and less happy , even though it &apos;s good results . 
and the market , there &apos;s nobody understood this when they . because if there &apos;s people understand it , you don &apos;t have to know what this is the idea . i mean cartoons . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in everything , terrible over all than now better . 
and the reason why is that when one of the things that are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , these rich in our civic life , the industrialized world , it &apos;s perfect . of course , for every one of the things you can only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
you will never be what was amazing , because you my than day and high expectations . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
so -- so i want to do it by a bit of time on to myself , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i don &apos;t have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans choices for you , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now obviously the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t make excuses that might mess . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they are good for decided -- so disappointed , to blame myself . 
in the past our generation , and the industrialized world -- countries in the clinical depressing , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like from the front . 
i remind you . 
and this to bring happiness -- the standard principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
of course , there &apos;s a choice to better than no choice , but not to this conclusion more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we choose ‘ rich ’ needs the critical value . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that has so much choice , is a huge abundance of matter . 
we in the world and places , at least we heard a few of those problems , there &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so here i talk about this topic is modern western societies on a particular problem . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible 气愤 question is , we make those expensive and very difficult to operate the car seats 于事无补 , just in waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is the expensive and complicated choice is not just 于事无补 . 
they &apos;re really bring us harm . 
they actually makes us from than before . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 improve and do it . 
product redistribution will allow the people , not just the poor , the good life , because we get rid of that as a plague affecting our excess . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , this fish know what ? 
tell you , in this fish in everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , that &apos;s the interpretation . 
but i think the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you will reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs this fish “ ” . 
and in this fish -- you know , for this fish is perhaps a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish , which means to be suffering , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i have to talk about this project , part of the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from those numbers code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” i want to be many biologists continued to try to understand in at different levels of problems . 
and we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to get them digitized . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , when it from the biological world computer simulation analysis entered the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab . and we &apos;re trying to understand if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate out of genes from 500组 一百组 is our current these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study is the synthetic chromosomes , so we can change its components to continue to ask the basic question . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never succeeded in molecular displayed ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , by the way down , just live without some sort of chemicals . 
our digital life constantly going up exponentially . . 
our genetic code to write the progress , and very slow , but it still increasing . and what we &apos;re going to put speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact it through a couple steps . we do in the first trial ago , i conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , long time , i made a mistake that much more . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 bacteriophage genome -- and the first digital information . 
a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of dna . 
the most exciting period is when we put this video there live sexual chemicals put into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release virus particles and back to kill the e. coli and 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , i think they this model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud more than you . 
so we think this is actually software is able to build a biological system within our own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you in the computer started using digital information . that these numbers to be very accurate information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , gene sequencing , right is the standard per 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found in sequence again , when the average is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence the genome , that they could never have turned on . 
design work is part of the length of time designing 50 character and the other 50 character long footage 叠加 to build smaller units . we had to design before they get together . 
and one that we design the unique part . 
you may have heard about in which we &apos;ve added 水印 
think about gene code has four character : a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 of the body -- and these scripts 编成 about 20 amino acids , like every amino acids , have a badge . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we created these fragmented and can use to cut 裁 enzyme . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , from 7000 character length of time to put them together make 24 , 7,000 character length of time and pull 几组 snippet merger , 72 7,000 into a long time . 
in each stage , we grow a piece of these , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process a minute , you will see 
we try to achieve autonomy level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very big piece of more than 100 , 7,000 for basic when they &apos;re hard to keep in e. coil in long longer . in trying to do a variety of modern tool in molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair dna , and it takes to piece together . 
here &apos;s an example , there are a little radiation called microbes 球菌 can withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images , its chromosomes nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will then assemble themselves back before the original form . 
we have this can have 千种 microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , moving around , in a new have water . 
in fact , nasa has shown lots of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of we made this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is a front mentioned yeast way and put it in the right after we design pieces . yeast automatically , will they aggregates . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is such a big molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
these are long , about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
this is more than 580000 character long genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface interval , not to put the print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously a very simple process virus dealing with a bacteria that more complicated . 
with like ourselves this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a tucked into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome with the cells into 连成 recently , but we also understand that we can do a whole list of the chromosome from one cell to move on to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process stop there . but we try to bring this process designed some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we found all accepted second chromosomes species or from elsewhere in the third side chromosome , one second increased 数千种 new features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution , and just have a genetic change the perception of biological ignoring the realities . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are able to digesting the dna . 
what cells chromosome without this enzyme enzyme without it , and when we add in a has this enzyme chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it &apos;s going to its digest , finally , we have a involved with the new dna . 
we put in the gene causing it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original characteristics of all species disappear , and completely into a new species , based on our cells and put it in the new software “ ” . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we reading the genetic code , is that we actually put into it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we really get through dna , to transfer to radically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of big life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to each of us from 1946 is ; the people in the next 40 years , the became four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is 一千万桶 every day . 
when we try to think about this creature program or any can replace it program , which is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is the material of indicated by the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world that &apos;s the one that has about 两千万组 genetic database , and i like to see them as the future of design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to kind of components , and look where we can get diversity . 
now , our main limit from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can make we call the mixing “ group ” rapidly synthesis of the way . 
what we have the ability to build a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is just standard choice . we can start to choose to survive , or chemical production fuel vaccine manufacturing , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit at work in the computer to really design species of software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what their genetic code looks like . 
we now bring attention on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third generations fuel . that &apos;s sugar into higher value of the fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
and the co2 is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we found from around the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a kind of microbes in 1996 , by them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost in boiling water of life . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecules and its energy source . 
we &apos;re looking at is able to collect the two has really , really convenient , they can be introduced to stand , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase the &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic question of understanding . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry 化工 little target . so -- so if you can &apos;t do that here at ted , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we are using the same tools to make this real-time 几组 vaccine . 
you see in this case , we always have to slow down on a year and lack of money in the case that when useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is the future might present situation with change evolutionary tree , now , as an artificial species of bacteria , 古物 is really the nuclear and biological accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we get a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this ted 09年 u speak in the short , brian cox : which shares some super 对撞机 news . content , including are now do the maintenance and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you must go back to update it on to the machine running . 
it is , if you last year , the lhc . not to be in the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state of manufacturing , every second 6亿次 and the state . 
a very ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical . 
we use these detectors for mini some camera big bang . 
this is i worked at the table , atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas process of building magnificent scale , you can see huge . 
last september 10日 we first started the process . 
this is a atlas shine down . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first picture clusters of particles around the lhc . along the way , as we have to plan with the lhc . in large part of the particles go flying off 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know it &apos;s got 满堂喝彩 or is this -- when people go to google , saw that graph is front page . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of the impact on top of it as a shock . 
but about a week later , we developed a machine that does to the main 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 current when they started machine . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , those wires ” too little . 
they can do it , because when it &apos;s extremely low them into the superconducting 导线 . 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below planet space between the temperature of these cases 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 have put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises that it is a little bit of a sudden they transmission 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a ruler miles . 
we have about 50 magnet damage . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 refer to be the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , get data and continue our mission to find out that the universe , basic units . 
now obviously , one of these accidents 激化 back the frontiers of science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s still too difficult task we with my pursuit of facts itself , which is where the value of the lhc . 
thank you .

really , just like that , completely , not saved , play 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very depression , came to me and said , you don &apos;t “ ? no . you &apos;re afraid of this in my life is not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s really going to comfort people ! 
i was met around the same question , people say , you not afraid will never work ? 
you not afraid of sustainable refused to take you click collapse ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair die , covered in a failed 苦痛 i was always get that question .

yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid not many people think that actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know not to . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , the fear of writing , recently i &apos;ve been wondering , why would i fear writing ? but , the fear of writing , recently i &apos;ve been wondering , why would i fear writing ?

i have about the next 40 years of my creativity 
and frankly , we look at all about that long , i would say is between the heart , and friends . this is probably me in my life , this is the biggest successes is over . 
oh my god , it &apos;s kind of idea !

after a deep thinking , in my view , to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i had to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance away from writing itself , and i work for the extreme anxiety open outcry from writing itself , and i work for responses extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because to end sent back to our problems . 
in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself in ancient greek and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred tense elves from distant and you know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know what the distant and you know where to the next artist , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks common to call it a with creative , to the djinn for “ 守护神 ” 
and people often think that , socrates have such a 守护神 from a distance , he was giving people to think that general wisdom socrates have such a 守护神 , from a distance to give him wisdom 
the roman people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius called djinn “ ” ancient rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called “ ” genius 
this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view wonderful rome , because people don &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly 聪慧 personal . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people from work on protecting the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissism ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great . it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of genius “ ” help work done . 
if you work a terrible , and not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is westerners in the last very long time thinking about creativity . 
and i &apos;m saying is that , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked to swallow 无异 from the sun , and the vulnerable individual , which is too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of our self , and for people to expand the achievement was expected that completely straight up twisted , one of our self , and for people to expand expect achievement . 
i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years together with many artists , i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think is this so the question is : are we going to do now ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : are we going to do now ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the older they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk 18 minutes , 抹杀 off the development of 500多年 rational human minds we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off 抹杀 developed 500多年 rational human mind . 
maybe i could not convince you agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make people believe in you &apos;ve all had to sit in that experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a normal 雷鸣 breath , and really down at her .

and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on paper , except sequence is upside down , from the last word go by , and go , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s unbelievable , and my creative process identical ! of course it &apos;s not my creative process of all , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad .

the performance , wonderful , because they were great professional dancer who show a wonderful , because they were great professional dancer 
occasionally , although very unlikely , but actually happen at a dancer going beyond present 出世 transcendent experience . 
you know , i say this is because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that shows . 
it seems to stop the dancer , though across the time seemed to be stopped , across the dancer as if he did . and before the 1000场 acting is nothing but different everything was amazingly unified up . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he &apos;s not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was the sacred fire shine 
now , people know exactly what it is , they can call out its name was , people know exactly what it is , they can make it out . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some incredible for the magic , people will 喝彩 : arturo “ 欧 嘞 , la , la 欧 嘞 , oh , really great , excellent ” incredible , which is good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up for artists , for the most tricky is the next morning , dancers 悠悠 turn up that tuesday morning was 11 , he &apos;s not good , there emerge of god . 
and that &apos;s only when bad leg , older people are going to the van , and maybe he couldn &apos;t get that last night , the height . 
probably never somebody in his dancing , god 喝彩 emerge from good , there he is going to do ? 
this is a very smart questions , and the creative process , one of the most painful cognitive self . 
this is a very smart questions , and the creative process , one of the most painful cognitive self , it &apos;s a very smart questions , and the creative process , one of the most painful cognitive self . 
but maybe we were all suffering , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you . 
so if we look at this point , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
坚守 in your the post , whether you jobs is : what if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
if not , that would keep dancing , your 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
if not , that would keep dancing , your 坚守 jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 ! 
i believe we have to teach this one . 
thank you . 
thank you .

in 2009 , al gore on the ted global shows the new situation , climate trend that &apos;s worth more than scientists , and he worried that for “ ” clean coal . 
al gore for recently climate trend warning . 
last year i was about to show you two demos the polar ice cap in the last 三百万年 in the area equivalent to the south america by 48 state area combined 缩减 40 percent . 
but they can &apos;t completely illustrate that question . because it doesn &apos;t mean that ice cap thickness . 
it feels like the polar ice cap -- just like a good global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of extremely 剧 . 
red is permanent ice 冻 
you see , it &apos;s moving into the dark blue is every winter form of the year in the summer ice 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” form , is about five or more years of ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood transfer 各部 guy in the body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the arctic ocean warming makes around 冻土 受热 layer , and there &apos;s a lot of being an 冻 carbon and -- 干冰 解冻 microbes , methane , carbon compost . 
if the top of a breakthrough , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of global warming pollution . 
some of the lake in alaska in shallow water now can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 went to a shallow lake . 
wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the boreal builds up the heat of heat greenland . 
this is a year , the melting of the river . 
but it is going to be larger than 往年 
this is the southwest greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land of how to make ice melts , sea levels rising and here &apos;s the 入海口 
here are rise 急速 traffic . 
the earth , the other side of the planet , the largest ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world from its molten water get half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , and we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , we &apos;re is very serious . 
the world &apos;s leading to fire and dry in big numbers . 
and the number of disasters , it &apos;s quite unprecedentedly with absolutely remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years time period , 总数 reached earlier 七十五年 总数 four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we day increases 七千万吨 co2 emissions 两千五百万吨 co2 to the oceans . 
watch the eastern pacific region from america to west in india , the 两边 含氧量 dramatically reduce the ocean . 
greenhouse effect of the biggest reason of forest destruction , except for 20 percent is burning fossil fuels . 
oil , coal most urgent matter 
america is a global two big one country emissions , and china . 
the solution is to build a use more carbon -- coal planet . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here are some of the recently discovered has and some new green alternative 
so now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political war . 
and carbon -- coal and oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal that &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth , in my hometown of tennessee digging up of billions of coal 淤泥 . 
you probably saw on the news 
here &apos;s the second largest waste , put them up . 
this is a before and after christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of carbon -- coal industries . 
mr. cool coal is happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile more productive , he also helped us economic development . 
mr. coal cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , the coal 产地 
the biggest is the head of mining coal massey 
so this alliance for climate protection and al gore &apos;s work , and one of the president now launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of explaining the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , coal not dirty 
we think , it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , why don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal is causing global warming one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing fascinated clean coal of technology that changed everything . 
and look ! this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the united states are in the national security and economic crisis , the climate crisis 
these are all the strings together for us is based on carbon oil products on like dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve the problem of projects . 
repower america with 100 percent renewable electricity in 10 years . 
americans new work to get to our lives more safe , and it &apos;s not in warming . 
finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the final 
this is about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
here &apos;s the future , wind and solar energy , a new network . 
new investment make more money there &apos;s lots of jobs . 
repower america &apos;s wishes come true . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables demonstration -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , i want you to remember that you &apos;re being a kid age played kit . 
when you idea how to build with legos and to do with it , and it is you &apos;re learning how to think about and problem solving . this is about the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand that helps us very 空间结构 around for a lot of learning things . 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , therefore the infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable is a computer , as you interact with a big cookie . 
siftables can use my hands , just move 每块 siftable each other senses can move each other , 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , as you can just with legos . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information manipulation tools . 
the more tools with independence , more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any with mobile , so we can use this tool to try something new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to demonstrate some simple . 
this has siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , so it &apos;s indicated in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , maybe that image it in the opposite direction , maybe . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you give them a 挨 a out ok , interesting thing that happens . 
and if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive , it would be kind of chaos . 
they can perceive moves with each other , maybe . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures and siftables , like a liquid that put down from a different color siftable into a siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel set paint patterns of siftables , we can put these barrel into color in the middle of the colors , put yourself together . 
if it was , how can we go back a few . 
siftables and machine learning function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , faster that result . 
this is i &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- and applause . this is me with a simple equation made of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix word games together . 
the words of playing games together as a way down , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter 几块 siftables together as words , it will siftables in lexicon automatically find words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spelling out to change the sequence shows , make the right word , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so -- thank you . 
so now -- now , i have on the screen some kids are in the media lab because in the test of siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this game play together words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them what . 
just to tell them that &apos;s a “ together words ” game , then they know how to do this . 
now i have on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the lower right-hand corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just wanted to siftables pile together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now i have on the screen a function of trying to interact with animation . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
the image of the children &apos;s felix . 
he could use some new add elements to animation image , what he did was to make the desk siftables pick up towards animation images voted image , you can bring these new to add elements on it . 
see , he took the sun add up . 
the sun liters up . 
david now he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good ! 
put that in animation shake siftables images that can bring new add elements to image on his new element to add up -- dogs 吠 . 
he was writing his own story of it . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , he &apos;s planning what story unfolding plot . 
cat sitting off in balloons . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function in 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables of this capability in terms of sound , can make like 超载 tone and bess and drum voice . 
every 四档 could have come to regulate , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable by the way you like . 
to put sound just come close to sound editors module . 
there &apos;s something like 响器 sound filter , which is a work siftable module . 
put this kind of come close to sound tiles can adjust sound . 
so , we can use to control master rhythm and volume siftable tiles near the end of the modules siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the two tiles 超载 into edit , and then add some 超载 sounds . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to filter acoustic tile near drums modules , that you can adjust sound . 
i &apos;m going to accelerate rhythm some just put tiles rhythm near the modules . 
now , and then bring a voice to the tiles shellfish tiles sound filter . 
music playing in the process , we can also 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s based on play , over time , but long and short . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited near tiles tiles on the left , with the place . 
and so -- thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up studies , we are doing in the lab . 
i want to tell you interact with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 of technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
