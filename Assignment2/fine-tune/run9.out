through rapture images and stories , for national geographic the explorers by wade davis celebrate aboriginal culture , the great diversity , these cultural is at an alarming rate away from the earth . 
by wade davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same kind of adaptive . 
we are born in 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience adult girl , sculpted by millennia . 
had to deal with cruel 生离死别 , so we need to sing and dance with 排遣 life 苦楚 we created art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture song and dance rhythm rhythm , has unique . 
all these communities show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different 人生观 
if you &apos;re thinking about , you can now send this different thinking makes you see hope . 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 a by mental life and culture intertwined in life , and the internet cover the earth for the earth &apos;s 芸芸众生 a very important point as we call the internet as the biosphere . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity . it &apos;s a very strong , we have the ability to look at the species . 
as far as the biosphere by the community was facing in the same shorter destruction , and it faster . 
this one of the most important is that language . 
we live on this planet , there were six : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammar . 
language is the human spirit shining 
it &apos;s the mental actually unique culture in the material world 承 dictionary . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a mental ecosystems , long-term 沉淀 and accumulate 
we know that the earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that and we in the same amount of these languages in half no longer to teach children . 
these language has no 传人 that unless we work , and it will be completely . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re last say 本族语 . you can &apos;t tell the wisdom of our kids don &apos;t allowed to predict the future of how this would be alone and scary . 
another scary thing on earth is about every two weeks will have a 年长者 仙逝 and this is a language with old . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today i want to do is take you to explore this race loop loop to make you in a big to understand and make you personally feel are death civilization . 
it &apos;s a lot of people who have already forgot the front , and i said “ different way of living ” i said to ” “ different . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 of pulling played methuselah areas that they called the 蚺 race because they believe in a time , they come from the 米尔克 东岸 was used for the sacred . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is because forest and the 栖身 , so they &apos;re 天穹 forest canopy , and it doesn &apos;t . 
they said , with a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 rules that 异族 通婚 a called went to the people with a different people get married . 
this was the mythology of historical lineage . you can see a strange phenomenon , because the 异族 婚 . a 大家族 often 六七种 language is you never see 操练 language . 
they &apos;re going to say a language . 
and i was exposed to the many ethnic ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 to one of the most amazing race in 1958 years earlier , i was with that they had to peace . 
five missionary 1957 years to approach them , but those who made a fatal mistake . 
they have in the next eight to 十张 they himself in the picture , we think this is the kind of that , but they don &apos;t think these live in 雨林中 people never seen two-dimensional . 
they from the forest pick up these pictures and images , trying to get over to find this one person , but they found nothing . and they think this is a call to devil cards , and they use with spears 戮 dead that five evangelist . 
more terror is not only 华拉尼 戮 external people . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent death population was their 戮 dead people . 
we have to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the more people with the 年迈 . it &apos;s going to wood , they will die for him , he 戮 送终 
on the other hand , they have astonishing for bush 惊诧 perspective . 
their predator can smell several hundred yards away 40 steps animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in order to understand the secret i have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo teach what it was voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark magic have . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated world 形而上学 . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
christianity , islam and buddhism , there &apos;s some other religion . 
voodoo individual beauty in life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
the soul in life . 
and the rhythm of to dance 翩翩起舞 can 大水 below soul to just replace life as a brief moment in the shining 侍僧成 for . 
so voodoo believers , like to say , you go to church worship to call god . 
we &apos;re in a cathedral , dance . 
you &apos;ve been household gods . how that will get hurt ? 
i was exposed to all of the community in colombia life in st. 玛尔塔 of 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is the tyranny in ancient civilization descent , they were once conquered and takes over the columbia off the coast of the plain 此后 they go back to the coast of a plain isolated . 
in this bloody ethnic 肆虐 continent that has never been the spaniards . 
and to their 续 today in the monk institutions to govern , but their monk 训诫 very unique 
they like to go back to 母腹 are taught the values that have these values that maintain the believers relationship with the universe we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s a beautiful , you want to protect it . 
they call themselves for 兄长 call for our 弟兄 say we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to create a very important . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 don &apos;t have the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether it &apos;s a mountain shelter , or god is a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
it &apos;s a symbol that this is a relationship with nature . 
i was in the jungles of british columbia as local people &apos;s thoughts . i think is going to be cutting the jungle . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these cultural created a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this is a picture i this past august northwest on amazon . 
it &apos;s 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 dead on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often use it -- dead on the water make psychedelic drugs . 
this plant is a potent the color is the ingredient and brain five -- 羟 color is 成份 very close . 
jamie 亚诺马 tribe , people are from with five -- 羟 color is plants extract the nose , and it took crack . 
if you use a nose sucked into the powder 光怪陆离 hallucinations , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you , but not distorted were totally wiped out 
but the color is matter doesn &apos;t oral because they &apos;re going to be human organ that is called a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity . 
to oral these color is matter have to change and oral list is 氧化酶 living as any chemicals . 
but this is the 藤本植物 there -- β 咔 啉 happened to be able to control one is 氧化酶 and play the color is working 不由得 , so you have to ask ourselves 
we ordinary people do all kinds of experiments keep making errors and measure . 
but if you ask indians , they would say that plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes found a dead people in the cane is they &apos;re all in the jungle in that we think they &apos;re different . 
if you ask them to a hierarchy is how these plants and they said , &quot; i want you to have some research . 
you &apos;re not there for plants to know what i say , is not . 
so i told you , if they said in the months circle night in the things that grow every plant to use the different little , singing to you . 
this , that &apos;s not going to get at harvard university ph.d. , but it than 报表 calculus is more fun . 
now . we have this question , and some of us indigenous that compassion something they 丰富多彩 离群索居 life , but as we world moving forward , these people in the back in history . 
and all cultures have been a new way of living as strong 
this is not technology . 
sue race indians even down 弓箭 still is the great sioux nation and the american people to go and sit 骑马 马车 life was still in the united states . 
the threat ethnic loop 完整性 is not change or technological innovation , it &apos;s the power of all those he robust . 
we take of tibet recently where i made a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the same , but by denounce genocide . it &apos;s cultural destruction people lifestyle without denounce 行径 by in many places it even be a part of this strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of tibet with 
this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the chinese people immediately , he was killed . 
his uncle and other together into nepal fled . 
his mother 富农 family because 成份 and be 关押 . 
and he and his mother , only two 悄悄地 put him in hiding skirts and bring him into a cell , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and was sent to 学习班 . 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the president of your hair 臂章 and to be about seven years of a nation 劳教 guilty . 
the pain of tibet for people to take human salvation to get to see . 
and finally , we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity . 
think about it , we have in the world , the 10,000 year is in this makes us feel . 
新石器 revolution human time to go to the top of the agricultural age we seed girl erotic 腊 萨满 poetry is the mantra of 祭 for for we created a hierarchy . this is a 社会分工 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial social only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to make that we have the ability to solve the challenges facing 
when we tell the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 a different . 
in a song of that , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that all race and all biological 昌盛 prosperity to live with . 
this is a picture i in northern 巴芬岛 on the mountain . i was with some inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 whale call that the people i talk to a about his grandfather legendary story . 
in the 1950s canada government is not always to treat inuit people to build our sovereign we put them to make 定居点 away by . 
this is the old man to move . 
his family worrying about security , and he put all the weapons and tools are taken away . 
you know , inuit people fear , it &apos;s cold , and god alone , thick . 
they sledge . the first slide in north america caribou 鹿皮 冻 package of a fish . 
this is a man and don &apos;t fear of the night and blizzard 凛冽 . 
he slept outside wearing his seal 长裤 he took skin stool and they pull on stool quickly become stiff , he put it into blades . 
and in this shit made to the edge of the blades puke 口水 when it &apos;s frozen and become very robust and then he did it take 刀子 宰杀 a dog . 
the skin 剥 dog made a 挽具 he and his dog made out of a dog sleds to another to between when that don &apos;t have to do with shit , in ice sheet . 
it &apos;s really 空手 make life . 
in many ways . it &apos;s inuit people in the world , all indigenous 顽强 living , the real 写照 
1999 four months canada government is going to a than california and texas area 之和 to the land returned back to inuit people . 
i &apos;m our new home , it &apos;s called le , new dimension 
this is a independent territories they control where all the ocean . 
this is very good example , a country that can make a difference managed to repair and its people relationship . 
and finally , i think for ever in the world , some remote people is not remote . 
because there &apos;s some 族类 home . 
they represent the human imagination branch that can go back to the millions of times , for all of our people , these kids dreams and our children &apos;s dream is to the world as part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through a national geographic magazine and do things , which is that we think politicians can &apos;t do . 
we think dh : argument is not to convince people through , but we think about it can make the world , so we could get to change the world &apos;s at about the institutions that our website , as a click of the three thousands of five 百万次 
we 156 channels in a play . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera y arcas demos the did this stunning photosynth , this software that could change the way we see digital images . use pick from the picture , a static photosynth created an absolute brute dream of view , and it can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas demos photosynth 
here we see is many many gb and -- 千兆 byte level of digital photographs , and they can do for and smooth zoom in , by the way you can mapping through them , you can do to rearrange them . 
they can see how many images of data , how big the and image how big , seadragon have these processing capability . 
so , show pictures , mostly by digital cameras shoot picture , but in this case is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the library of congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , look at it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because it limited system , the only thing is , you can use a screen like 素数 . seadragon , and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , the data is an image . 
this is what the dickens had 荒凉 山庄 , &quot; is chapter three content . 
i gave you prove that it &apos;s really not text and images , we can do that , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be an electronic book reading . 
but i don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical example , this is a &quot; the guardian &quot; . 
each one is a picture of 张大 opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version of itself contains proportion of the images , reading , and people would get better experience , reading and enjoying the pleasure . 
here we made small change in this &quot; the guardian &quot; to a corner . 
we make a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you see a normal commercial resolution higher , and embedded in a lot of the extra content . 
if you want to see this car properties , you can see here . 
you can see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a way to use a screen is actually limits . 
we want this technology will reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , which is use digital maps of one of the applications . 
so , i don &apos;t want to spend too much time to talk about , i just want to tell you about this . we &apos;ve made their contributions . 
this is nasa geography of the space . 
to 叠加 process and get the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can themselves to experience it . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merge with two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other is different from graduate school at the university of washington noah snavely are going to work with computer vision . this research , i get washington university , steve seitz 
and rick szeliski of microsoft &apos;s help . this is a very beautiful cooperative results . 
this project on the internet we &apos;ve got , it &apos;s based on building seadragon technology . 
you can see , we have many pictures back to the way , to see that image of a subtlety 剖析 and have more resolution through experience . 
but these pictures , at the three-dimensional folding is actually meaningful . 
i &apos;m not sure if we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples than this space , and strong . 
mainly because when we make site , to take care of law that problem . 
these are all the images from flickr , by this by in space 串联 up . 
and then we can so easily , to have views . 
dh : be honest , i never thought i would last for microsoft . 
by this , and to really be happy . 
i think you can see the these images from a lot of different camera phones , from the cameras to the professional alone . so a lot of different images , all the quality of being in this environment into building in . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors 大头 contains the pictures , etc . 
i remember this should have a sequence of images -- well , here . 
this is paris notre dame posters . 
we can get to look at the poster in their environment . 
the point here ? is that effectively , we can use the internet community . we can see everybody data to get everybody environment for different memory collect together , we build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , however , what a lot more than just to collect it all . 
this is a model , however , the whole planet . 
this is stephen lawler , like , &quot; &quot; virtual earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
user picture , you will be the 注 labels . 
thank you very much . 
if i understand that correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software that really means is to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up in hypertext . 
this 接合 process . it &apos;s based on the content . 
more exciting is that image of semantic contains that information . 
for example , what you &apos;re in the picture , the key word later , page text will have a picture with this relevant information . 
now , imagine these pictures and you all the images together , that would ? 
and so these semantic information to each other , and a link in is going to be big . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
the 施瓦茨 : choice in time . 
i think here to talk about that part of my books . i hope it and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that have empathy , if you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
i want to start with a the standard principles about it . 
what the standard principles ? 
that &apos;s the western industrial society 笃信 疑 is not a principles . 
this is to say , well , if we allow people to get big benefits , on its way is to make personal free to maximize . 
why is this thing in the freedom to is that good and valuable , for people are essential . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can 做主 using their various ways the big enough to get welfare , people they don &apos;t have to for my 做主 . 
and the freedom to make a lot to do is the largest increase selective on . 
people more freedom to choose , which are much more freedom , and you get welfare is more . 
i think , like this idea that 掺 into the water that age-old in that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas and deep embedded in our day-to-day of life . 
let me give you some examples look at the social progress . let &apos;s be possible to do something . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
i just want to say salad ingredients here . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets looks like . 
and you turn out to be a one and a pop-up stores it sound system -- voice box for cd machine , because , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s the one in a three-dimensional sound system that don &apos;t know how to count . 
with this store components that you can have last 650万种 out of the things pop-up sound system . 
you can &apos;t don &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a bunch of choice . 
in a business , talk about communication . 
i was a kid , you want to refer to was phone service , which had to go to the company , just a bell it . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent an 电话机 back . 
usually , the telephone is going to die are not bad . 
that day are 一去不返 . 
now we &apos;re almost there &apos;s an endless phone species , especially . now , phones that cartoons . 
these are the phone . 
and i &apos;d 津津乐道 is in the middle -- that will take mp three the machine , a cut hair and french 焦糖 布丁 in 火枪 . 
if you haven &apos;t in the next to your store seen it , don &apos;t worry , with no . how do you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people went to the store , and you ask : is there a not so much with function ? &quot; 
you want to , answer would be ? 
answer is no “ ” . 
now you &apos;ve can &apos;t buy a not so many things to do the phones . 
and in life , the other day , we produce more than to affect the things that the same choice , up there . 
health care -- in the united states , right now are not that you go to the doctor , doctors straightforward tell you how to do era . 
instead , you get to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
for a very nail and so forth and risk . 
for a very 乙 and so forth and risk . you want to how to treat ? 
and you say , “ doctor , should i do ” how ? 
they said , again , there are these things and nail risk , 乙 have those things and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
if you ask doctor : “ doctor , you &apos;re me , you pick ” that ? 
they said , “ , but i &apos;m not ” you . 
now the prescription over the ad is for these people around you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said , if we can &apos;t think a can &apos;t go to buy 柜台 . 
why are we doing things to market ? 
answer is , they want to look at the advertising , and the next morning would go to your doctor , on the phone , and they put on a prescription drugs in their . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became topic of choice . like this slide trying to convince you of that . 
now our gender , not from my parents inherit down there , but by ourselves to invent . 
so we can what have you back to the shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up for you to do today , you want to do a kind of men and women and . make a decision . 
in the marriage of the family , and everybody was married to the age of course , it &apos;s almost thing , and it &apos;s 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing that you need to and who is getting married , rather than when i , it &apos;s not married , what to do . 
and now it , everything that can take 挑拣 拣 pick . 
i teach a bunch of smart students good , but now i give them all placed homework time less than one fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they than ever before -- and the students stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so who . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , are always asking myself , i got married , what should or shouldn &apos;t married ? is going to now ? 
and , furthermore ? i &apos;m going to have kids , i &apos;ll 顾 business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still don &apos;t do i all placed homework , whether they in my class . take a grades . 
they really need to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can in one day , any time in any one of the work -- of course , it &apos;s the basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant did have a place to wifi , but i &apos;m not going to tell you are . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason i wanted to use . 
anyway , we work these incredible to give us the freedom that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , for their work now that &apos;s right , and the rest . 
we go to the kid play football , in a 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 it in with their blackberry blackberry . now , and it goes on the laptop . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we still looking at in 场上 rivals for children and kept asking myself , i don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to the email or not ? i don &apos;t have to write this an 信稿 ? 
even if you give their answer is no , you have kids that the experience of the game was still big 打折扣 . 
look around , whether thing was , the small things matter and lifestyle part , life is choice . 
we live in the world is like this . 
i mean , choice is still there , but not 事事 all need to choice . 
today we live in the world is this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or not ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s no beauty . 
all these choices for people have two impact , it &apos;s two negative impact . 
one , it &apos;s kind of an oxymoron , which is , &#91; choose &#93; bring us not liberating , but inside , it &apos;s paralysis . 
with so many people that have to decide , very difficult . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to do that , it &apos;s about a project to wait pension investment has to do research . 
one of my colleagues have access to invest vanguard to record . vanguard is a big companies have about a foundation , millions of people , and two 000多个 office place . 
her research , that &apos;s when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number is two percent . 
you give employees 50种 foundation , to provide people than you 5种 fund 10 percent , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 foundation to choose to decide that we do that is even more difficult , so you can actually trying on tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s get , you &apos;ll be more tomorrow &apos;s , of course , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
not to wait for this project , they make up to the year of 5千元 employer 对等 subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer was very dedicated to this subsidies . 
so , to have the possibility of rigid is paralyzed . 
it makes us into this world look like this slide show this cartoon . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision is right , right ? 
where you really don &apos;t want to choose exactly a foundation , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
choice , the more puzzling for something , to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy . they make decisions . 
secondly , economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today . so dan gilbert told a 大道理 is , we see something depends on the values that we used to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have many options to think , is very easy to imagine that you pick up a compelling ways . and that makes you always right . you see the think 美中不足 . 
for example , that -- and it , but if you are not new yorker , and i have a 歉 . 
but this is what you should think right now . 
look at these two hamptons 口子 . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach 明媚 , they have it . 
you can better than this ? this is where it thinking “ huh , really , it &apos;s bad ” “ in august , ” . 
“ manhattan neighbors are not home , ” 
“ i want to go back to the car stop in my own ” front . 
and for two weeks , he was such an idea torture and in every day 念叨 lost percent better chance in the parking . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let us to make decisions are not even in this very happy to 英明 . 
we have options these options , the more attractive . it &apos;s more , and all these things become opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
this cartoon means for . 
it also say the “ live in the ” this idea . maybe there &apos;s one thing to do step . 
but , in a sense is , when you chose to do something that , you also have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing to have a lot of attract you place , and will undermine you &apos;re doing appeal to you . 
and thirdly , 增高 expectations . 
this little at a time , i went to buy a new jeans , i was so stimulated . 
i &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you get back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time , enough to wash over a million times , pants to become 凑合 . 
so that , in many years old , i finally pants 上街 to buy a new . i said , “ feed , i want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and they said , you &apos;re 紧身 , comfort , , or 宽松 , ? 
the first to 扣子 and drag locked ? 石磨 and acid with ? 
to a kind of fast them ? 
and the back , and it &apos;s mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask them . 
my jaw , almost off . and i had to 缓 god , i asked , “ i &apos;m going to that used to be the only kind of ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a fog water , and i spent a 钟头 试穿 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , i can take a me the most 合身 pants out of the door . 
i do not really wrong . those choices that i have to do better . 
but there it was worse . 
why ? for this , and i specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and i felt worse reason is because there &apos;s so much as i can choose , for a jeans what should have much good to be a good expectations . . 
i was very low expectations . when jeans is now a , i didn &apos;t expect a lot . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least a is the best 极致 perfect . 
it &apos;s really cool , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so i get i had to and i want to do , and i expect more than it is , it &apos;s become disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together in a choice , except for things to people about what a great outside expectations didn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
that &apos;s just to make people and less happy , even though it &apos;s a good results . 
to market there &apos;s nobody to understand this , because if they know there &apos;s people , and you don &apos;t have to know what does that mean . i mean it . 
it &apos;s like this cartoon by now , in everything very bad and everything is better than now . 
and the reason is that when a normal things are not so good , people might experience to some surprises . 
now , in our these rich , industrial civic life in the world , perfect . it &apos;s of course , for every single thing you most only hope it &apos;s not worse than you would expect . 
you will not be what you know what , because i than my high expectations and . 
what is the secret to happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret to happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t have high expectations . 
but now , i think a little bit of time . you talk about myself , i married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , i have to . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of shop in jeans for you choose , you buy a back , don &apos;t think is happy , and you ask , why , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , the answer is : you . 
you can actually do better . 
there was hundreds of out on the jeans , you don &apos;t put things excuse f it up . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even though that would be very good , and they were so disappointed to decide -- , to blame myself . 
in our past generation , the industrialized world and -- if the industrialized world , explosive growth . 
and the net effect is , even though the objective we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t like the from ago . 
i remind you . 
the choice , happiness , and that -- well , the standard , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
of course , a choice to better than no choice , but not conclusion that choice more is better . 
there &apos;s a key , and i don &apos;t know how many . 
but i &apos;m sure we already far beyond what we actually ‘ choice ’ needs , the key . 
i said it faster . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society that have so many choices , is a rich matter . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least , we heard a few of them , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so i &apos;m here to talk about this topic modern western societies are on a special issue . 
steve . 里维特 yesterday said , incredible 气愤 question is , we make the expensive and it &apos;s the car seats babies 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and i &apos;m going to say is , these expensive and complicated . it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us harm . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not as from ago . 
this is what economists call it the 帕累 and fix it . 
products redistribution will allow all people , not just the poor , life better , because we get rid of that as a pandemic affecting our excess . 
end , you should look at this cartoon , and a guy standing position , “ huh , the fish , know what ? 
tell you , in this fish , everything is ” impossible . 
no imagination , 目光短浅 -- i first saw this painting , this is the interpretation of it . 
but i think , the more clearly felt this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you have not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible and put the fish , you &apos;re down happiness . 
you increase the is paralysis , reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a fish that “ ” . 
in this fish -- and you know , for this fish , maybe a little bit smaller , for us , almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic fish that is going to suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
craig venter is going to make artificial life . 
before that i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
and we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology , and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new design in biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to put a big problem . 
what is life “ ” , i think it &apos;s a lot of biologists continued to try to understand in different levels . 
we tried many ways , put it into the tiny components . 
now , we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to go to the . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , and it was from biology and entered the world , the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to questions , we could build any life , or whether we from the digital world to create new life ? 
this is a microbial sequence picture , mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s got to a species , the smallest genome in the lab to make it replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can 500组 genes separate out from the 一百组 is our current these . 
so that we can continue to study the only way is to synthesize the chromosomes , so we can change its of questions to keep the fundamental problem . 
so we started along the way we can go down “ synthetic ” chromosome ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these we never make a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way down , just some without live sexual chemistry . 
we digital life constantly exponential rate in speed . 
our genetic code to write the progress very slow to it , but it was accelerating . we recently , what &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact , it took me through the stages . we do in the first trial ago , i have a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it &apos;s synthetic dna is very difficult . 
the world have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of dna , in 30 to 50 character , and this is a regression process , made the long time , that &apos;s the more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to put these little snippet goes together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first attempt , from phi x 174 . so -- to bacteriophage digital information . 
it &apos;s a little viruses can kill bacteria . 
we created the genetic pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character of dna . 
and the most exciting . when we put this video there we go live chemicals into the bacteria , the bacteria started reading the genetic code , made a virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the e. coli &#91; 革 兰氏 negative fungus . 
i recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some other , i think they to understand this model very well . 
and the more than you laughing out loud . 
so we think this is actually software to build a biological system in their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re on a computer started using digital information . that those numbers have very accurate information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , gene sequencing , right , the standard is every 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , the average in sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use to sequence the genome , they could never have turned on . 
design work is 50 character part of the design of time and the other 50 character long piece 叠加 to build smaller units of the time . we have to design , they get together . 
and we have a design of the unique . 
you may have heard about us to 水印 in one . 
you see there are four character genetic code , a , c , g and t . 
these scripts 三联 -- the body and the character 编成 about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , this is a map . 
so we can use genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to a poem . 
we made these snippet and can use to cut enzyme 裁 . some enzymes are used to fix them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , 7000 character from a piece of to put them together to make people 24 , ask the length of time to time and 几组 merger , a at a time , people . 
in every stage , we grow a piece of these , so we can give them -- because we wanted to create a very reliable process a minute , you &apos;ll see 
we try to automate level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very big piece , over 100 people in their basic , it &apos;s hard to keep in e. in coil long longer . try to do in the modern tools of molecular biologist in , we turn to other ways . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology to repair , using dna , it &apos;s time to put that together . 
here &apos;s an example of that is a little radiation to withstand 球菌 三百万度 radiation amount . 
you can see on top of the images , the chromosomes , nieces , in many places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it would be your back , and before the original . 
we have this can have 千种 . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
i was completely convinced that outer space , there &apos;s life , and move , in a new have water . 
in fact , they have to show you a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a we take this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is mentioned yeast in front of the way , and we put it right , design pieces . yeast aggregates automatically them . 
it &apos;s not an image microscopic ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
these are , long about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the test results . 
it &apos;s over 580000 character long genetic code . it &apos;s by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we think 10号 typeface , not in the distance to print out . it takes 142页 to print the genetic code 
so how do we start a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is a very simple process that more complicated . 
with like ourselves and really nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a the nucleus , and tucked into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we know we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell move on to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is so . but we try to bring this process of design into some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we &apos;ve had a second of all species or from other parts of the chromosome , the third side , in a second 数千种 new increased features to its own . 
that people can hold in the process of evolution , and only a genetic change the perception of ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes can be digesting the dna . 
what the that cells don &apos;t think this enzyme there , and when we add in a have this enzyme chromosome . 
it presents out , and recognize the chromosome is an external matter , it &apos;s going to it , and we have a contains a new dna . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the original . all species disappear , and completely into a new species , based on that we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins are membrane changed , and change -- when you &apos;re reading the genetic code , in fact that we put into it . 
this might sound like genetic 炼金术 , but we did get through dna , to move to radically change things . 
now , i &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not invasive century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i think we can create a new version of the cambrian explosion of life appeared on this digital design new species . 
why do that ? 
i think , for some reason , we need to do is very clear . 
our population will in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , i was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people compared to every one of us from 1946 , is people in the next 40 years , becomes in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 people to provide food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to fuel the . 
change to nine billion people that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 coal , 300多亿桶 oil , which is every 一千万桶 . 
when we try to think about the biological process or any can replace the program , it &apos;s a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , this is the material that was in the co2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
and we found from around the world . there &apos;s a contains about 两千万组 genetic database , and i like to use them as the design components . 
electric industry , there &apos;s only 10 to a components , and what we can get diversity . 
now , our main limited from reality in biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because they can make “ mix of what we call the ” rapid synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to create a day chromosome . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can start to survive , to choose , chemical or fuel produced vaccine manufacturing , etc . 
this is a screenshot from the thing is something that we actually sit down , really work in the computer to design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what their genetic code looks like . 
we &apos;re on the attention “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you have seen corn ethanol is going into a bad experiment . 
soon we will have a second and third generations fuel . it was sugar , into a high value for the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and co2 is one of the way -- 
and so -- -- but we &apos;ve found in the world , we have a number of types . the other way . 
this is a , was in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep . about 1.5英里 deep , almost boiling water in the environment . 
it put co2 into methane use hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
we &apos;re looking at is able to collect the two really , no , they &apos;re very easy to get a handle on , into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we may increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic question understanding . 
we really have replace the oil industry 化工 little goal . and -- now , if you can &apos;t do that in ted , where you have probably ? as a major energy . 
and we &apos;re using the same tool making a vaccine 几组 immediate . 
you see this came flu , we tend to slow the time of year , and in this case , they really useful vaccine . 
i think this is what you were made by a vaccine to change . 
this is the future might present situation with change , now , evolutionary tree , with synthetic 古物 species of bacteria , and it &apos;s nuclear biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , it can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 ted u short of the presentation , brian cox shares some which super 对撞机 news . the content , including are doing the repair and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
brian cox : the lhc . out of what happened ? 
in the last year at ted i introduced the lhc . 
and i said , you have to go back to it . it is the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the lhc . here &apos;s the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second state , every second 6亿次 and make the state . 
it &apos;s ambitious 
this is in 日内瓦 underground mechanical 
we use these for some camera that little big bang . 
this is that , i worked at this atlas detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
it &apos;s atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last september 10日 we first started this one . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters picture of the particles way around , the lhc . we &apos;re planning with the lhc . and , in a part of the particles that 辐 go flying off . 
in other words , when we see a in september 10号 like this , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
i don &apos;t know this got 满堂喝彩 was this -- when people to see icons like google front page . 
this suggests that we do have the cultural shock that with the science as a shock . 
but about a week later , we created a machine that does to these major 导线 about -- the golden 导线 
these 导线 transmission 安培 and they start when the machine . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , too little ” these wires . 
they can do , because when it &apos;s very low , they become superconducting 导线 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below the planet in the temperature of the universe is these 导线 can transmission so strong electricity . 
at the lhc 九千多个 电磁铁 in in a 接点 have put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise , it is a little bit of transmission of 安培 suddenly they and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnets up to 20 tons , they move about a ruler miles . 
there are about 50 magnet . 
they have to put 卸 down , they &apos;ve done . 
we give them out , it does . 
now just wait for them to go back to the ground . 
in about three 月底 by refer to the lhc . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in june , july , to get the data and continue our mission to find out of the most basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents to 激化 about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but that &apos;s very easy to disprove 
i think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still have that my for itself , it &apos;s value in the lhc . 
thank you .

i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love with the with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love with the with life . 
i &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , but i love with the with life . 
i think it &apos;s never going to change . 
however , recently , in my life work , has a special event , however , recently , in my life work , a specific event happened that i have to rethink and the relationship between my work . 
it &apos;s now , if i get where people think this is the result is that life , and if i get where people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , no saved , play 完了 . 
they &apos;re very to come up with , and i said , “ you not afraid ? no . and you are not in my life beyond the book ” ? 
they can just get one ! &quot; 
i was around in the same question , people say , you don &apos;t . never succeed ? 
you &apos;re afraid of going to continue to collapse , you say ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of dying in despair , with a failed 苦痛 i was always get to that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : ” “ . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
actually , except that , i &apos;m afraid that many people think that &apos;s not something beyond that , i &apos;m afraid that many people know not to . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , the fear of writing , i have been thought , why would i fear of writing ? but , the fear of writing , i have been thought , why would i fear of writing ? 
this is it a rational idea ? 
people fear destined for their work ? it logical fear ? people in their own destiny ? this logical work ? 
no one said , “ john , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ? ” . 
never would happen this question . 
of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer a group that doesn &apos;t in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last century , a couple of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world .

i want to ask all of you is , you have no dispute about that ? i want to ask all of you is , you have no dispute about that ? 
all of you think this idea ? no problem , even from a little bit further to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of a little bit further 臆断 even to look at this point , i don &apos;t agree with this kind of 臆断

and the idea is not only 可憎 , and horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century , but the point 可憎 , and horrible , i don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
i think that encouraged our great creative genius , they will be to live . 
and i , myself , believed that it to my dark 绝境 and in my own case , believed that it brings me to the dark 绝境 , especially in my career at stage , especially in my career , right now . 
you see , i was young , i came to 40 years old , you know , i was young , i was 40 years old . 
i have about the next 40 years for career 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , i would say , is a friend in the heart , and it really possible , and i &apos;ve ever had the biggest successes . 
oh my god , what is this idea . 
is this idea , makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine is not the way , is this idea , makes you took a 大清早 drank piano wine on the road , no . i don &apos;t want to be . 
i don &apos;t want to be that i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : should i do ? 
i want to do what i love writing things , so the question becomes : should i do ? 
and deep thinking about it , for me to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , i have to create a psychological protection . 
i have to in some way , to build a safe distance , the difference between writing , and i work extreme concern for responses from itself , and i started writing about response extreme anxiety . 
this brings me to find the ancient greek and ancient rome . 
so please patient hear me , because to end sent back to our problem . 
in ancient greece and ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the ancient greek and human in ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the ancient greek and human in ancient rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from the human . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred to from distant djinn , and you know where artists around here , with a remote and you know it , and you know from remote places where artists around here , with a remote and you know . 
the greeks universal to call this a with creativity to for the djinn “ 守护神 ” 
and people often think socrates , there &apos;s such a 守护神 , from a distance , he was giving people to think that general wisdom socrates is such a 守护神 , give him from a distance . 
the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of create called the djinn “ ” the romans have similar ideas , they put this kind of create elves called ” “ genius 
this view brilliant people , because i didn &apos;t think ” “ genius is a particularly 聪慧 personal this view brilliant people , because i didn &apos;t think ” “ genius is a very personal 聪慧 . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what i was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people 成败 from work on protecting mechanism . 
we can understand its business model , right ? 
ancient artist by this idea , and get to protect the narcissism artists of ancient by this point and get to protect , excessive narcissism . 
if you work great . it can &apos;t completely thanks to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass ” “ genius with the help . 
if you work a terrible , and not all your . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you ” very bad “ genius 
this is in the western for a long time thinking about creativity . 
and i want to say , i think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
in his 无异 to swallow the sun , this for vulnerable individual , , it &apos;s too big . 
it completely straight up twisted , one of cognitive , and for people to make most of it . they completely straight up twisted , one of cognitive , and for people to make expanding this . 
i think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of kill artist and i think is this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least i think is this so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
so the question is : now , how do we do ? we can change the situation ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them with understanding of human creativity ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to look at them with understanding of human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , the 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 better human . we can &apos;t use a short talk , the 18 minutes 抹杀 developed 500多年 better human . 
maybe i can convince you all agree with me . 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but i want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any had tried to make people believe that there are things that you had this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s creative process , we can make sense 
like a breath 雷鸣 where , in her , and the really 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is going to her power 撼动 feet into the ground . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this is going to her power 撼动 feet into the ground . 
and now , she was the only thing to do only one thing with her words , is to “ 死命 狂奔 ” 
in other , and this is called me the most amazing part : in other , and this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she almost about to 错过 poem . 
and she would take the other hand , grab the poem tail 顺势 and put it back , the other hand , to the poetry 誊写 on paper 顺势 and put it back , the other hand , to the poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will 完好无缺 to present on the order of it is upside down , from the beginning , the last word go by , and , until the first words . 
i heard her story and , like , is amazing , and it &apos;s my creative process . it &apos;s not exactly the same of course , and all the creative process , i &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
but even 古板 , and as i have to get an incredible inspiration , but even 古板 , and as i have to get an incredible . 
there &apos;s many of you may have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i will meet and to the idea of where you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and i don &apos;t know where to go through and inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on here ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it , it will not losing rational ? we &apos;re going to see how it , don &apos;t mind going missing ?

you know what i say that because you have in a moment , have seen that . 
it seems to stop , dancer if across the time seemed to stop , across the dancer like he did . and before the performance 1000场 and no difference , but all of it amazingly together . 
刹那间 , he is not a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom . 
刹那间 , he is not a normal human , his life in the light , light from the bottom , he was the shine sacred . 
and people know exactly what it is , they can call it the name of the time , people know exactly what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s good , there emerge . 
in spain , when a performer done some amazing for the magic , people will pull “ 喝彩 : oh , 欧 嘞 , 欧 嘞 , oh , great -- really , really great , wonderful ” that is good , there emerge . 
this way , is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky , is the next morning , dancer 悠悠 turned up for the most tricky for artists , is the next morning , dancer 悠悠 turned up tuesday morning , that &apos;s 11 , he &apos;s not good , there with god . 
it &apos;s just that when bad old legs , are going to people , maybe you , and he couldn &apos;t get that at last night . 
maybe never in his when somebody dance 喝彩 god with his good , there should be , how are they ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
this is a very hard problem , and the creative process of one of the most painful about this is a very hard question , which is the creative process of cognitive of self . 
but maybe we were all suffering , so if you were never thought , what the hell art completely from you , if you were never thought that wonderful art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t 气馁 , just do your part ” . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you . does : if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
坚守 in your jobs , whether you . does : if you &apos;re a dancer , which dancing . 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 . 
if not , that would keep dancing , 坚守 your jobs for you , i still 喝彩 : 欧 嘞 . 
i believe we have to teach the idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
欧 嘞 . 
in 2009 , al gore on the ted showed the world &apos;s new is that trend , climate scientists , more than a remarkable , and he worried that for ” “ clean coal . 
al gore recently trend for the climate . 
last year , i &apos;m going to show you two about polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last thing in the area of the equivalent of the american south 48 state is 缩减 a 40 percent . 
but that didn &apos;t fully shows that the . because it doesn &apos;t represent the ice cap thickness . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer heart 舒张 heart . 
i &apos;m going to show you is that over the last 25 years really 剧 . 
red is a permanent 冻 ice 
you see , it &apos;s moving into the dark blue is in the year in the ice in the summer 冻 permanent ice . 
so-called “ permanent 冻 ” , it &apos;s about five or a longer the ice , you see , it &apos;s like the move to 各部 &apos;s body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect of the arctic ocean around 冻土 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being 冻 an carbon and -- 干冰 解冻 , methane , carbon microbial compost . 
if you break a greenhouse gas emissions , it &apos;s going to the atmosphere of global warming pollution amount . 
some of the light in alaska in the lake has can see the 探头 沼气 . 
last winter , the university of alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
wow . 
she &apos;s ok , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , north deposition a heat greenland heat . 
this is a every melting . 
but it than traffic 往年 are . 
this is the greenland southwest kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand the land on how to make ice melts , sea levels rising here is the 入海口 
here are 急速 traffic . 
antarctica , the other side of the planet in the ice . 
last month , the entire continent report , scientists are in decline of the ice . 
in the west antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting islands . 
so that &apos;s equivalent to the sea level 20 feet , and greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is ice 
40 percent of the water from the financial gain half of the water . 
in 安第斯 mountains , and the ice is the urban drinking water . 
traffic was . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in california , sierra of snow 40 percent every year . 
in fact , this is a water . 
and as you see , assuming is very serious . 
global dry . was fire in that number . 
and the world population in time is absolutely remarkable quite unprecedentedly speed . 
in the last 30 years , 总数 in time to the first four times more 七十五年 总数 . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we every increase 七千万吨 co2 emissions from the ocean 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
look at the eastern pacific region to west from america in india , 两边 含氧量 in the ocean . 
greenhouse effect , the biggest reason , except , of forest destruction burn oil fuel is 20 percent . 
oil , coal most urgent very important . 
america is a global two big emissions , and one of the country . 
the solution was to build a more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s some recently discovered the and some new green alternative 
but now , in our country -- but there &apos;s a political . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry in the last spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of something . 
christmas back and forth in my hometown , tennessee digging up 淤泥 billions of coal . 
you probably saw in the news . 
and here is the second largest waste , put them up . 
and the christmas back and forth . 
there &apos;s a coal industries that carbon . 
coal is cool , happy and happy avatar . 
in the united states , you can see he fertile productive and more and help us develop economies 
coal cool sir every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , the coal 产地 
the biggest is the head of massey coal mines 
so this alliance for climate protection and is one of al gore . and now this of two projects . 
this is one , one part of the 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to set our initial goal for explaining coal and the truth . 
in fact , coal , not dirty 
we think it &apos;s clean smelled good . 
so , don &apos;t for global warming and . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal plants . 
spectacular machine some 喧哗 . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and burning coal is causing global warming , one of the main reason here you can see the incredible fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
and look at it . this is now the clean coal . 
and this is a solution to deal with the economic challenge and national security . 
the u.s. economy is a crisis , national security , climate crisis 
these are going to the strings together for based on our carbon oil products on are like the coal and import oil 
but now , there &apos;s a new solutions to solve these problems . 
repower america with 100 percent renewable electricity with a time . 
and you get to the new work that we live more safe , and let the earth is not warming . 
and finally , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
repower america , about more . 
the last one . 
this is about repower america . 
old oil and dirty on our planet , and this is for us to the less dependent on the fastest way . 
the next here . wind and solar and new energy . 
new investment to create more money huge . 
repower america . it &apos;s time to dream well . 
there &apos;s an old african saying that if you want to go quickly , independent ago . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 ago . 
we need to do is go further and faster . 
thank you very much . 
david siftables you would think -- a toy . 
first of all , i want you to remember that you &apos;re being a kid with the era of a kit . 
when you design with how to build with legos and to do , is you &apos;re learning how to think about and problem solving . this is the object 空间结构 understanding and feeling . 
understand 空间结构 very that help us to learn a lot of things around . 
this would be questions , and in my mind , so we decided to get the answer , so we have this infant siftables . 
simply said , siftable interact , it is a computer as cookie of size . 
siftables can hands just move , 每块 siftable can perceive moves each other , each other , 每块 siftable and displays and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like the block , you can have with . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- is this digital information tools . 
the tools , with more and more sensitive to each other , senses , feel any with mobile , so we can use this tool to some new interesting interaction . 
now , i &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable 映 like it , if i put it to tilt side , and what it shows in this picture , and maybe , if i put it in the opposite direction , and maybe that image , maybe in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive each other . 
if you put them a 挨 a out ok , interesting thing will happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they would perceive that there &apos;s a kind of chaos . 
they can perceive each other &apos;s moving and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that down from the color of the siftable into a siftable . 
let &apos;s look at the demo , there are three dollars a barrel of with paint patterns siftables , we can put these tank in the middle of the colors into that , along with the color . 
if it was , how can we go back a few . 
siftables and learning machine function , can be used to learn arithmetic and language , actually -- we want to use these functions to learn to become 快捷 , faster that result . 
this is what i &apos;m here to siftables reason -- and this is working . i do with a simple equation of fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together -- a word scrabble and boggle remix games together . &quot; 
this &quot; play games together in a way , as the next , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put a letter 几块 siftables together to make words , siftables in the dictionary automatically find the words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell change the sequence it shows , make the right word , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
and so . thank you . 
and so on the screen -- now , here are some kids are in the media lab because in the test in siftables experience , i put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this &quot; play games together , we don &apos;t need to explain what they . 
just to tell them , and this is a word “ together ” game , they know what to do . 
now i have on the screen on other people to experience siftables . 
the bottom right corner , this woman is age , the little experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now , on the screen that is an animation to function interact . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
and this is the child felix . 
he can put some new elements add to animation image , he can do is put table siftables pick up towards animation images that image , which can bring these new add to the elements of it . 
see , he to add up to the sun . 
the sun it up . 
david and he put tractors add up . 
the orange tractors . 
do good . 
and to shake siftables animation images that can make a new element . he put into the new elements to add up -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing belongs to his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open-source end story , and he was planning on plot how stories . 
the balloon sitting off . 
i &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function and 编排 , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables this function in terms of sound , can make like 超载 . and bess and drum voice . 
and there &apos;s tiles 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into siftable by the way you like . 
voice , just to put sound near the tiles module . 
there &apos;s this 响器 , which filter , the sound effects siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles come close to sound can adjust the sound . 
so , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume siftable tiles come close to the editor siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to take the two tiles 超载 into edit , and add some 超载 sounds . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now , the voices were drums filter to modules , that you can adjust the sound . 
i &apos;m going to accelerate on rhythm , just to block the rhythm to module . 
now to put sound to filter tiles shellfish tiles . the filter . 
music playing in the process can to 编排 . 
so don &apos;t need to have 编排 , it &apos;s playing , over time , you can play a text . 
and finally , i &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
and so . thank you . 
as you see , my vision is to develop a new medium to human-computer interaction better with the human brain works . 
today , i &apos;ll show you a siftable , our next is a study in the lab . 
i want to talk to you with the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation combining cutting-edge technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology products , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation will see . 
thank you very much . 
i expect to share with you .
