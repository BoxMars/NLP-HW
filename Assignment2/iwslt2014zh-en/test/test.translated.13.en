meg jay : why 30 20 is not new . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need mental therapy patient . 
and i was a university in berkeley read clinical psychologist . they 3d students . 
she &apos;s a called alex 26 women . 
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she &apos;s going to tell me about the men . 
when i heard this , i disengaged . 
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people i want to talk about boys . 
i think i can deal with this thing . 
but i can &apos;t do that . 
alex in every meeting , all that funny story , so to me 点点 on the head , and out of the time is a very , very easy thing . 
alex would say , &quot; this is a new the , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later , in order to have to have children , even after death is to have . 
and i like alex like 二十几岁 people apart from the time , nothing . 
but not too long , and i started to push it 催 alex love life . 
i refuse . 
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next one of these people getting married . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it so ! &quot; moment . 
and in that moment , i learned that 30 is not new 二十岁 . 
yes , more people than ever late 安顿 down , but that doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between 低谷 her development . 
and alex 二十几岁 to develop a good time , and we sat kill it . 
and i realized that this &quot; kindness oversight &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for love , alex and her life for people around the 二十几岁 families and the future . 
now , the united states have about 5千万 二十几岁 people . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about nobody can experience 二十几岁 stage in this case -- and adults . 
if you &apos;re 二十几岁 , for a hand . 
i really wanted to see here , 一些二十几岁 people . 
that &apos;s great ! you are great . 
if you work and 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people and lost o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people , very important . 
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old . 
this means that every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with , &quot; it so ! &quot; moment of eight happened in 30 中旬 . 
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money you &apos;re going to make a very big impact . 
we know more than half the people before the 30 终生 partners and married , 同居 , or on a date . 
we know in your brain 二十几岁 adults , to adapt to the second issue is the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own what , now is to change its time . 
we know life stages 二十岁 , other than one big change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit , 35 years old and that &apos;s a little hard to do . 
so you 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body in the future , and the choice . 
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago , the brain development and admiration language is the critical period . 
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact of the time . 
but we hear a few there &apos;s a thing called adults development , and our 二十岁 this stage is the critical period for adults development . 
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard . 
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change . 
researchers have 二十几岁 called extend adolescence . 
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid , like , &quot; the names , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , we have is actually adults 期中 known as the most important decades doesn &apos;t matter . 
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time . 
this is not right ? 
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ? 
what &apos;s not going to happen . 
you take that personal sense of urgency , and worked , but nothing happening . 
or , &quot; you are said to me , just before the 30 started my career , no problem . &quot; this one . 
but then they start talking about , &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have to . 
i graduated that the best 写写 my résumé . &quot; 
and then they start : &quot; 二十几岁 date , like a seat in games . 
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but to about 30 music will stop off a for a start , you sit down . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently &quot; chair &quot; . &quot; 
and the 二十几岁 where people ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
well , that sounds that might have a 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , in this very high currency . 
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and as research to that , in this phase 三十几岁 and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big . 
on a millennium , middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy . 
that is my job is not want to . 
that is , you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or can &apos;t give their kids a people . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people what to do best . 
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do . 
this is a about a name &apos;s emma women story . 
25 , emma came to my office , because she , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art , or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at . 
because cheap , she and her show that worked 脾气 more and more than my boyfriend live together . 
and no matter how hard it is her 二十几岁 , her life was much more difficult . 
she &apos;s in a meeting , crying , but said , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took a morning to fill her people , but she can only stay for look on &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this a word -- &quot; the blank behind . 
the last 歇斯底里 she looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot; 
and i spent a lot of effort to avoid said , &quot; i &apos;ll . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment . 
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make emma that has decided to do that 10 years , we fall . 
so in the next weeks and months of , i tell emma three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women , should all be heard . 
first of all , i tell emma forget her identity crisis and started to accumulate identity capital . 
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value . 
do you want a for what &apos;s going to be investment . 
i didn &apos;t know emma career , the future , and nobody knows the future of my own work , but i know this : identity capital would get to more identity capital . 
this is a professional accept that multinational , in that space , and you want to step up to the time . 
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i &apos;m 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to tell you can &apos;t called exploration . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of work and get them to count . 
secondly , i tell emma city tribes overestimate . 
the new capital , the new can get almost always about people from the inside of the circle at . 
new things from what we call the weak to come in , for example , our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends . 
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment . 
but it &apos;s not about half the connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group . 
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connection to your neighbor boss is you get that was not 张贴 work the way . 
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about how to pass information science . 
and finally , emma believe that people don &apos;t have a family , but can choose friends . 
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people &apos;s emma , soon to pass and somebody 结伴 , create a family to take her family . 
i tell emma choice family time is now . 
you might think , is a 20 , 30 than 25 is even better security , the next time , and i agreed . 
but when you &apos;re in other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your 同居 or sleep people don &apos;t call progress . 
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which means that would love to do that work like as rich . 
choice family is conscious choices you want to people , and that &apos;s not just want to make things success or and to the people you waste your time . 
and how that emma ? 
well , we made it into the address thin , and she found her an old roommate a family of another state in an art museum work . 
that faint . she was there to find a job . 
and that job give her a left her 同居 he reasons . 
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and her to a consciously . people get married . 
she loved her new career , she in love with his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 fence seem to be a big enough . &quot; 的卡 pieces . 
emma story to this thing sounds very simple , but that &apos;s what i love and 二十几岁 why people work . 
it &apos;s so easy to help them . 
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport somewhere in the destination flights . 
and the fly , a little challenging is falls in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s all the difference . 
likewise , at 21 or even 29岁 25 , a good talk , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 years , and even generations have a very big impact . 
and to give a worth spreading , and you know who 二十几岁 ideas . 
it and i learned to say to alex as simple . 
don &apos;t be you don &apos;t know , or didn &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re in determines your life . 
thank you . 
李镇河 : 李镇河 into computer : &quot; real world , you play &quot; infinite imagination 
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s our real world and the gap between the virtual world . in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , is a touchscreen glass so thin , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the good ? 
so i started to try this crazy idea . 
i first made that tool , it can go digital space , if you take this with a pen that force on the screen , this is a pen pen and going into a little pixels of virtual worlds . 
designers directly in three-dimensional space to their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery . 
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of borders between . 
but we also &apos;s hands out on the screen . 
how can we reach into and digital information to interactions , and use our flexible hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space move into the number of work . 
because in reality window and file a space , pick exactly where they become like shelves from a book , and so easily . 
and you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands or stretched rotate all kinds of models . 
in this example , that we &apos;re in the digital world . 
but how can transform it to get the role of digital information into our world ? 
the believe in a lot of people have online shopping and 退货 experience . 
but now than you don &apos;t worry about . 
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 in line . 
this is the system , and our body geometry , and we drive through a head or a way to look at that show us the situation . 
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make space that we see a little pixels into can actually have to touch , feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , by the 雷米 , make it a &quot; as a matter of . &quot; 
in this case , this spherical shape 磁体 like we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and people will move the object that little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place . 
we make the basic principles , the gravity is about the role of a ball and it &apos;s magnetically levitated , mechanical sense , technology and drive it together , a ball to control movement . 
by the number of programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , people can movement in the world of matter that can be recorded , back and forever , keep . 
so , dance 编排 can be remote and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action can over and over and over again , to actually be repeated itself . 
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force . 
more exciting is that this is not the computer put things into a real stuff , but to think , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity . 
as you can see , digital information that will not just to give us , but that &apos;s going to start working on us to be part of our physical environment , not cut our connection with the real world . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can get the border , the rest is we enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
&apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 had two 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years . 
when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , all free . 
i said , &quot; no , the tiger mother . &quot; 
my parents , and i hope they elephants as long as engineers . i want my parents elephants as long as they engineers . 
as 文革 survivor , they only get -- think happiness is a reliable way of 高薪 work . 
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter . 
but i dream is to be 黄梅戏 actor . 
that &apos;s my premise playing the piano . 
戏曲 to learn from small actor to actor 戏曲 身段 kung fu , to start to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i want to do everything 黄梅戏 to want to go to school . 
even wrote to the principal 戏校 with a radio host . 
but don &apos;t have a big people love that idea . 
not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious . 
they just have my 小伙伴 for me , but they also a child , and i did powerless . 
it was 15 , i know that i &apos;m going to learn how to play has age too big . 
my dream is no longer going to do . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in their life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ah ! my god . 
i decided to their dark for another mission . 
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learn from the book . 
and the 三毛 全集 南怀瑾 &quot; and &quot; history experience . &quot; i in 1995 , to the united states , in the united states , what i first read a book ? 
and of course , is the 禁书 . 
the earth about &quot; is china farmers . 
real to be propaganda . okay . 
bible interesting , but also very strange . 
the topic 他日 and talk about . 
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; that &apos;s not and more than &quot; submission . &quot; 
it became i climbed out 儒家 负罪感 tools , it became i climbed out 儒家 负罪感 tools , and i rebuild the relationship with their parents . 
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from big to use a world map . 
i had never realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily have to map in the world . 
this map , with a view . 
compare reading is not new . 
it &apos;s in the academic standard approach . 
比较文学 , even be a religion that research . 比较文学 , even be a religion that research . 
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding . contrast to control scholars to a project has a full understanding . 
and i wonder , if you have to study in reading , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ? 
so i started putting a book about to read . 
they can be about the same events different parties , they can be about the same events different parties , or two a shared experience , friends . 
jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desire , fear and social responsibility -- interesting . 
if you know , the book , and you like two language . contrast read &apos;s interesting . 
so thomas 默 translation . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 watts , the &quot; moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost it , i was found that translation can lead to harvest . 
for example , is to translate that i realized that chinese &quot; happiness &quot; a word for &quot; means it &apos;s literally rapid joy , &quot; well ... 
in &quot; the bride , &quot; a word for &quot; literally mean it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
i have a book with an amazing discovery 今人 communication has become a portal , books and 今人 lack of communication , a magic . 
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless . 
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 what . 
i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose . 
it is the most important is that we touch from place to dream , passion sources of places , happiness , the place . 
even a broken 灭 dreams can get you through that touch . 
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , live happily , life of purpose and meaning to become clear , in most of the time . 
and hope and never will you at any age . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
john 帕鲁尔 颂歌 塞加尔 : envy . 
when i was eight , classes new to a woman , her life so compelling , like all new to the girl that . 
she &apos;s a lot of the 光泽 秀发 a cute little 文具盒 specialize in a name that week in that no one can than spell . 
that year , i was the people were envy until i want to make the evil . 
one day i dropped out of school , and the second 逗留 to actually get a night , i &apos;ve been silently sit on the toilet 
and one time , i &apos;m 出动 to go from a classroom teachers get for the table . 
and then i conspiracy win by stopping . 
and i change my opponents scores only is it a little bit , and put some a 降级 . 
well , it &apos;s all a 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other students and high score to awfully ! 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i make all the way people , but not and creativity 
i gave all of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line , because i &apos;ve been in this , more to do something completely 
i still didn &apos;t understand my behavior . 
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out . 
i don &apos;t know why , that &apos;s wonderful . 
i was feeling great . 
i don &apos;t know why i had never been found 
i mean , this thing to do so . 
i hasn &apos;t been found . 
but it &apos;s important , so why i care about this girl , in this tiny little girl , and at the spell ? this point i keep confusion . 
envy threw me 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that babies are the envy torture 
know primates envy , blue 知更鸟 very to envy 
we know that &apos;s the murder spouse agents . 
but i never read a study to explain , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s lonely and there , or it &apos;s cruel . 
in order to understand it , we have to look at novel because fiction is a laboratory to study . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
well , i don &apos;t know this is not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have a literary ? 
if not 忠 ocean , it &apos;s not the odyssey . &quot; 
no 妒忌 where the king , there is no &quot; 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we have read 书单 high school , because we &apos;re losing the 喧嚣 a was lost , &quot; and &quot; remarkable &quot; is the gates than the sun rises , &quot; are losing the 包法利 lady , &quot; &quot; anna 卡列琳 her . &quot; 
don &apos;t envy , no 普鲁斯 . now , i mean , i know people always say , love 普鲁斯 all know what to envy , but said that he did know a thing . 
this is his 巨著 追忆 , &quot; water &quot; 年华 一百周年 this piece is right . well , it &apos;s the research that we can think of common 竞争性 , which is that i was . 
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we will think about the emotional . right ? 
we want to a small boy is 入梦 
think about a 玛德琳 in 薰 衣草茶 of cake . 
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye . 
he &apos;s so cold , no compassion 
these books , in virginia 伍尔夫 seems like a cat gut . 
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it 坚 as 顽石 . 
we look at these things come together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and envy , and there &apos;s 普鲁斯 
妒忌 comes down to people , from that desire , as a firm foundation narrative is not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s a sensitive nerve to me , because we just think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we feel envy , we &apos;ll make a story . 
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they were just to let the &apos;d suffered . 
we tell ourselves as stories , and the audience know exactly where join in the details where fatal 一刀 . right ? 
let &apos;s have a novelist amateur 普鲁斯 , and that can understand . 
all she did what i &apos;m happy thing is going to give people happy , maybe now is going on ? &quot; 
this is he began to create their own story , and then , the portraits , 普鲁斯 every lover of that he &apos;s a new glamour him , &quot; sexual 虐 密室 together in a series of tools . &quot; 
now we have to admit , 斯万 and 普鲁斯 two people , the infamous envy . 
you know , 普鲁斯 of my boyfriend , are you going to tell him that 分手 to escape from this country . 
but you don &apos;t need so envy will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
and you &apos;re 疲 &apos;s body 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , have to get . 
envy like ? 
envy love information . 
like detail . 
like a big put 光泽 秀发 cute 文具盒 . 
like envy . 
this is the reason that instagram . 
it will actually 普鲁斯 academic language 相联 with envy . 
when the millions of struggling to his envy , and he started standing in front of him to bribe 偷听 lover servants &apos; quarters he defense for this behavior . 
he said , &quot; look , i know you think it &apos;s people hate , but it and interpret a 古文 or look at a memorial no two . &quot; 
he said , &quot; these are the scientific research , there &apos;s really knowledge value . &quot; 
shame , grief , loss : these are 普林斯 , to wisdom . 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman has made our pain . we all emotions than , let &apos;s interested in a genius , can have more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel woman ? 
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s . 
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotional would let &apos;s see , our own hostility ugly trying to heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that wrote that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think he did his wife , and so 憔悴 ours . 
freud think this guy kind of weird because he didn &apos;t really do focus on what his wife . 
because with his wife &apos;s , you know . 
this poor guys just 缘由 , no doubt . 
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move . 
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it &apos;s very good at novel about how we see training pitch , but it &apos;s not a gets it right . 
well , we envy more intense , we will be more often . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do that violence , or illegal . 
it &apos;s going to become very extreme . 
i admit , i think the eight years old , but i also think about yourself in the news see a story . 
michigan 一个52岁 women were found register a facebook account false and used to account for their malicious year sending the news . 
a year . for a year . 
she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before the aisles girlfriend now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her . 
because , i want to say that , you face reality . 
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , right ? 
this comes from fiction . 
a 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel . 
and i love is 海史密斯 writers . 
she &apos;s in the united states 文学史 brilliant and 诡 a page . 
for example , tom , but in her case , the most famous . 
里普利 started to you or want what you have , then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in a basement he 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but how do we do ? we cannot repeat 里普利 . 
i couldn &apos;t give a huge change the world , even though i would one day be able to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in admire . 
we live in envy . 
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , right ? 
we can give novel solution ? i &apos;m not sure . 
so we &apos;re going to 学学 novel characters , see , they meet in the most difficult thing , and don &apos;t know how to do . 
let &apos;s go back to 贝克街 221 夏洛克 福尔摩斯 , ask the b . 
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would want to his competitors , rivals 里亚蒂 professor -- this genius . 
but i &apos;ve been more like a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face scottish 头子 福尔摩斯 . he really need to him , but hate him . 
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this . 
he &apos;s 垂 雷斯 to help , and he hated the secret of the cases 侦破 , always and 苦闷 story 
we proud of you . &quot; 
it said , was not in scotland , people who don &apos;t want to hold 福尔摩斯 . 
this is 少数几次 福尔摩斯 we see in the way , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it &apos;s like to as a geometry , instead of emotions . 
this one minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite 
the next minute they stand in the same . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he had hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if envy is really a geometric problem to do , a about how we choose your relationship with other questions ? 
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent . 
we &apos;ll chase . 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment , here we have to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction 
it has been going on with envy fiction 
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it please . 
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy , millions , there &apos;s 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there . 
we have so good . 
thank you . 
ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash . 
so i was 10 , and once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 . that &apos;s a mountain in the new york in the zone . 
it was really good weather . 
the forest searched twinkling lights . 
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like the 晶莹 stained glass feet . if you don &apos;t have a way , we have to pretend that we &apos;re at this piece of the first human . 
we eventually got to our camp . 
that &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing . 
in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet of the big 见方 garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing . 
people to camp was too lazy , even with all the ourselves up not ken . they think , who can clean 善后 for them ? 
and all this question bedeviled . i became a more sound bite . 
who &apos;s going to clean up we leave the garbage ? 
but you can put it in any problem you live in a 伊斯坦 . where we leave out the garbage ? 
in rio we leave out the garbage ? in paris and london ? 
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector , we have to leave the 000吨 11 , and the day of the 2000吨 recycled . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know who &apos;s doing this work . 
in the sanitation trucks were parked on this in a sense of responsibility for what ? 
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project . 
i was sitting in the car , along the line of the interview in new york , all the sanitation trucks were parked office workers live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not sitting in 垃圾车 , i open 垃圾车 . 
i myself and the electric 扫帚 铲 its street , in the snow . 
that &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process . 
everyone can be asked the smell . 
there is smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad . but you soon it will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even though there are a few years working side of the body worker , they &apos;re trying to adapt to it in a week megatons of garbage . 
so there is at risk . 
with the labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked the work is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then slowly . i know why . 
you all day on the road , which are of traffic . 
out of the car just trying to drive more than you , people are not careful . 
sanitation trucks were parked workers for me , it was too bad . 
and that , the itself is poisoning , these 毒物 often from 垃圾车 comes out , in a terrible harm . 
i also learned the cruel and scary . 
when you &apos;re walking down the 路沿 , sanitation trucks were parked car in the city , you will look at a time to recognize the really like the power of nature itself . 
it never is 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like breath , or a circular form . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , it was called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked . 
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important workforce . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if they don &apos;t efficient day quickly cleaned the words , from the in containers , bring it to the poison in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we attacked a century after 10 years 和数 disease , again , there will be to threaten our health . 
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , we have no space new things . that &apos;s it , economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less . 
i don &apos;t use capitalism , i &apos;m here is just that their relationship . 
and the third reason -- is what i call the average , we need to , 经常性 activity speed . 
i mean , in today &apos;s in and days , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know that there is a work in teams were sitting over there to clean this thing off . 
so today i want to suggest that you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked situation to help , maybe they &apos;re called . put them in , to talk about how to build a sustainable people , the city . 
i think their work is a noble . 
every time , they really very to work in the street . 
in many cities they wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work . 
you know , they would be to clean up the on time . 
they allow us to secure in their work . 
they almost became secure that work . 
they have to work for ourselves and traffic safety 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and junk . this is going to work in all need to keep stability . 
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 doing a week . 
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy . 
his name is 保利 times , we worked together , and become friends . 
i want to believe that 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
the city , that we know the of the amount of garbage actually only three percent . 
this is an amazing data . 
so in your life every day in your life , the river , the next time you see somebody in when you leave out the garbage , please find a time 致意 to them . 
find a time to say thank you . 
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory . 
please close your eyes to me . 
imagine you &apos;re standing outside your door . 
please attention 一下门 colors and the materials . 
now , imagine a naked people on the overweight . 
going on a naked cycling to your front door and run and . 
to try to imagine 近在眼前 alive . 
they &apos;re 奋力 , on the pedal 汗流浃背 very 颠簸 
and then 径直 into in your front door . 
bicycle wheel fly 四下 go flying off from you roll as a spoke into that corner of embarrassing . 
the threshold into 门厅 in the hallway and other parts of the soft comfort . 
the light on the sweet pastry monster . 
he was sitting in this horse brown on the 骏马 马背 is 招手 to you . 
and the 马会 speak . 
you can feel his blue 鬃毛 nose 发痒 for you . 
you can smell , he was thrown in your mouth granola 曲奇 grapes . 
around him around , he walked into the living room 
standing in the room to your imagination to imagine appeared on the largest 小甜甜 britney 
her wear exposed to you coffee table dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot; 
and with i walked in your kitchen . 
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 you get out to the oven , you go to the track , &quot; &quot; 绿野 仙 in dorothy 铁皮 people 稻草人 and lions their hands on 蹦蹦跳跳 walking arm in arm , came to you . 
okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;m going to tell you a annual spring in new york are going to have the unexpected . 
it &apos;s called the memory 冠军赛 
a few years ago , as a journalist 科技类 this race to the thought about there in the way to look like that . &quot; &quot; super bowl 冠军赛 bustling . 
a bunch of men and women 屈指可数 from old to some girls don &apos;t notice and personal health 
just look at some 奋力 in a situation hundreds of any to remember the numbers . 
some trying to remember the populations of strangers . 
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem . 
and in a game , who can remember the faster the 一整副 打乱 card order . 
i was like , it &apos;s amazing . 
this must be other 禀 talent . 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training . 
i asked him , &quot; what is ed you , started to realize their memory is genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; i &apos;m not experts . 
and my memory was . 
to this each one of them will tell you just average memory . 
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of ? &quot; 
we stood outside the hall smart 过人 amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really want to in the u.s. national radio britney on how to remember 一整副 打乱 card order . 
can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can teach taught me 
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot; 
and then a very strange way 序幕 out in front of me . 
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he suffers amnesia his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia really amazing . 
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can learn in which the memory of shape our personality . 
this is another extreme i met somebody like this . 
his name is kim peek 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; role in . 
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library back to phone books , i think is just fascinating . 
and i went back home and i read a lot in papers about memory wrote papers 两千多年 ago in latin write from ancient until then , during the medieval 
i learned a lot of interesting things . 
one is used to train beam may grow memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 people to send in your memory to 不遗余力 to your mind . 
these technologies for modern life possible , but also we change . 
not just in the culture , and i think in cognitive . 
kids don &apos;t need to memory sometimes think we have to remember how memory . 
in this piece of the earth has very few places that makes you think people still interested in training beam may grow memory . it &apos;s a very memory . 
it &apos;s not so extraordinary to do this all over the world . 
i deeply about this with these people want to know how to do it . 
a few years ago london school of a university researchers asked to a contest to study memory . 
they want to figure out the human brain , we do to others in anatomically structure different ? 
the answer is no . 
and they are smarter than us ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny . 
but compared with the goal is to control the brain and memory . there &apos;s a really interesting is that the different . 
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory number or 人脸 pattern , or kind researchers found that memory . there are brain areas activated with ordinary people don &apos;t . 
notice that they think , is in the brain in space and memory , to navigate with . 
why ? what can we have to look like ? 
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective memory show 赛场 and other ways to catch up . 
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there . 
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 card he in order to an hour down with all that is a he actually invented , but only he would . 
and this with the same way that he had a word , not bad back down 4140个 any number of binary . only half an hour . 
a cow . 
in the competition of 参赛者 using a lot of different memories of different ways to be used for all the skills and can to into a concept psychologists call a delicate code . &quot; 
this idea to use a humor paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker simple of paradox is that i have two people to remember one word i told you say , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot; 
that &apos;s a baker . 
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot; 
after a while back to you and i said , &quot; remember what i call before you remember the word ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what word ? &quot; 
that &apos;s been 人名 baker people remember this word possibilities are not as being told a baker that person . 
the same word cause different memories . 
why is it ? 
because no particular 人名 baker . 
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any . 
but baker used it as a noun that we all know baker &apos;s . 
baker with funny white cap . 
they hand and flour . 
they came home from work with 扑鼻 a toast . 
maybe some people have a friend &apos;s baker 
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to produce all kinds of ways that we can make in a time can still remember . 
this precise memory skills in 两千五百年 ago have ancient greek . 
and call it through . 
this invention skills , there &apos;s a process called simonides following the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party 
and he &apos;s been asked to do , because in the performing guest in the fancy party cool is not just d. j. to play reduction , but to please poet ode to . 
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died . 
not all death all of them are going to come down on 面目全非 
no one said to them what are some of you who don &apos;t say to people who sat where 
the body can &apos;t get to the right place 殉葬 
and then reinforce the whole thing tragedy colors . 
simonides as standing outside of the site of the close your eyes had suddenly awakened to realize that in his mind in front of him all 宾客 are sitting there . 
he was hold the hand relative to the site and they brought up to us . 
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we are not remember name phone number or colleagues , every instructions that we all have very keen visual or space memory . 
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i just simonides story about 10 years ago , &quot; should not some people will remember . 
but i bet , if i give you the now back in the foyer . you sitting in would speak brown on 骏马 who is that you see , i just saying . 
this advice from 两千多年 ago , the first latin . 
so this phrase . what ? 
if you were invited to stand in the center of the ted stage and you want to talk to 脱稿 as 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the normal 霸气 that he would go one , and you want . 
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their 
and imagine working with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy a ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster ed , sitting on the back . 
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook . 
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney you would like to talk about britney of that little story . 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topics are you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association 
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just the only reciting 添麻烦 but remember , one by one . 
and the theme is that phrase , &quot; &quot; from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is 古时候 people to talk about rhetorical , or in the space . 
&quot; the phrase &quot; means your memory through the 第一层 
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started 萌发 a more detailed it that the memory of my culture . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is memory process is very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there . 
the most exciting moment , don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source . 
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing ! 
i know that these people in your mind must be 惊涛骇浪 as 外人 , but i can &apos;t see 
i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience . 
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times ago to spend 十五 20 minutes to do something . 
there &apos;s little back . 
back in 跳蚤市场 back , i bought in 年鉴 old people . 
i was surprised to find it very 带劲 
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise 
it &apos;s goal is not to train memory . 
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working build with that completely funny 胡乱 is better unforgettable images . 
and it became my fun . 
this is my competition , with a standard memory training suit . 
it &apos;s a 耳塞 a 护目镜 all 镜面 hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the biggest attention that is the enemy . 
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 . 
i also want to drive a signed up to it as an experiment in the news . 
when i thought to be in the 前言 调侃 it yourself . 
the problem is experiment finally get unexpected consequences . 
i won the competition . it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
back to me now talk 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles . 
don &apos;t use it to build memory palace or remember 几副 sequence of the cards and you can actually learn from some of the brain works for good . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think that other people &apos;s gift 禀 it is not . 
powerful memory is can acquire . 
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember 
engaged , can remember 
memory palace , or the memory skills are just 捷径 . 
and they really can &apos;t be 捷径 
this work is because it forces you to think about 
it forces you to go deeper to make you more focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to the training 
it doesn &apos;t exist 捷径 
this is what we have to remember things . 
i found that we experience with your own body 潜藏 the amazing memory . 
but if you want to live memorable do is to remember that often memory . 
thank you . 
and who lee duke 沃斯 : success ? willpower . 
on my 27th , i resigned as a very challenging career -- business management , and to turn into a more challenging professional : education . 
i came to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math . 
and as other teachers , i &apos;m going to give students do little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
when these 试卷 and homework open up , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst the only difference between the students . 
some of the great in 课业 that students don &apos;t have a very high iq points . 
some very smart kids , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 . 
this got me thinking . 
and of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like rates , small number , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation . 
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , as long as they would spend time and energy . 
after a few years later , i have a classroom that in terms of education , we need to learn from the perspective of psychology , and the students and learning . take a more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we all know . good student is standard iq , but if you &apos;re in school and the good life do not just as easily efficient depend on your ability to learn ? 
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids , and the people in the very challenging circumstances , and in studies of treaties , my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they success ? 
i and my research team to point out 西点 research . 
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out . 
we see the first to build a word , and also try to predict what kids can level-up in the end of the game . 
we look at work in hostile environment work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students . 
we work with 私企 , they sell to ask what people can stay in . 
what can the more money ? 
in all the different context , a character , no one out , this character in a very large extent predicted success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
it &apos;s not beautiful appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on . 
tenacity is have sustainable 恒 something happened . 
tenacity is you for the future , every day on , is not just for a week or a month , but a few years for decades trying to make their dream and reality . 
tenacity is put life as a marathon and it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in the public school , i started to research that willpower . 
i &apos;m going to the 千名 初中生 about willpower survey of waiting for a year , and more , to see what the graduate students can . 
all is not the point in 西点 or the words to put the race to willpower . in school is also true , especially for those in the dropout 徘徊 children . 
for my own self , about willpower me the most incredible things , we cognitive is heading for willpower , creating willpower , understanding the science that &apos;s how poor . 
every day have parents and teachers to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and what they move the long-term is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know , talent and can &apos;t make you gritty heart . 
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , according to our data in willpower with other factors , usually without off , even with the brilliance scale run counter . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard about children to be resilient in the most effective called &quot; growth model for thinking . &quot; 
the 卡洛杜 at stanford university , with a view , and he believed in people &apos;s ability to learn , it can change the way , and as you try to change . 
professor 杜威克 means , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain , and it facing challenges , what was happening , and what they grow , and keep going to fail more , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure . 
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower . 
but we need more . 
and so i decided i close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is what in front of a job . 
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in back again . 
in other words , we just have to become more willpower to let our children to become more have willpower . 
thank you . 
泽维尔 dimensions , that the : into local culture . 
as an architect , i was in architecture and design , to think about , building and the environment , and around and around the building and the environment , which is the relationship between tradition . 
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples based on this idea . 
this is two examples in the emerging countries , a in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
one of these cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall . 
this is my team and i was the same for example , we were asked to design into this way . 
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do . 
look at the same in this kind of architecture , the city of -- a lot of this kind of building -- we found the architecture of the most important three questions . 
first of all , the building is basically empty , because they there are some big store , people are not the big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because architecture is were outside this design glass , going to be trapped inside heat in architecture , and so we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this city climate is very 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. . 
the third problem is the building looks like a relationship between africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t . 
for a cultural 底蕴 so rich city , it &apos;s called people down . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was so fascinated with the local 集贸市场 . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the outside environment , from 小商贩 in all want to buy products . 
this is the same idea to me , is in outdoor public setting the idea of creating all kinds of activity . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 this idea of building ? 
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a fast cities in the photo , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist . 
and this building on the before and after two parallel in the street , and there are no 几百米 little can connected . 
so we need to do is we use this very building a portal , all the way up to this two even . 
and then we have a gradient 庭 of design , create an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 . 
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same . 
i think , the question is , how the walls of the building patterns ? 
and i really want to find a patterns , to design for the local environment . 
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building . 
we from ethiopia beautiful women on the pattern of traditional dress got inspiration . 
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to this question , of course the outside walls . 
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and control in the way we light into the building . 
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night . 
these ideas , but we didn &apos;t start building , and they moved , sort of like , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all know , this design solutions to than traditional mall solution to make more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop . 
and this the design of the wall , reduced lots and lots of cost , it &apos;s not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of the air conditioning to control . 
and eventually , we also save a part of the budget . 
where is the first question is , think about how to make sure that building in power to the city , because we are almost every day . the 闸 electricity . 
so we were on the roof of the solar panels . 
and then we thought , can on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , to be here in cities , for people 小憩 oasis . 
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the building clean . 
we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , well . 
the second example is to design a city tunisia over 2000套 collateral infrastructure and an apartment building . 
do scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i need not just very profound tunisia understanding of the city , and she also need to understand all kinds of tradition and culture . 
and in the process of my attention is a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a structure , over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure , there are 12 相互之间 through the door , almost straight to the road . 
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 basic small region in size and all the characteristics , similar to what we in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning . 
these blocks in planning basis , any mentioned idea , we have a few key points , the key to connect with a straight line , to change a model . 
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , like a cubicle , is this big of planning basic components . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking , for a in the mediterranean climate apartment them , what is the best ? 
the answer is , can use to 南北朝 南北 house on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we do this kind of model for all the apartments , have perfect facing . 
this is we design work together , like a city with european style , the combination of residential style . 
there &apos;s some building with garden , and walk around on the ground to the whole together . 
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management service , 上层建筑 population density of high , the population density is not very expensive . 
and she &apos;s enough for us to even 通性 between a portal . 
this is the roof of the project i 得意 part , it &apos;s like these buildings are going to be up to the space , and give a community . 
the community can climb to the roof , and poke somebody talk about god , or make some sport , like in the morning , on the roof , or run a 两公里 between jump back and forth in architecture . 
these two examples of some common , in the design process with the same way . 
again , they are in the city , you can see the little 拔地而起 building material . 
in cities , architecture for people , and on the present and future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate . 
for this reason , i think about the architectural design , the more important in between , which is , looking for simple solutions , and cheap enough to increase and promote the local people , and the relationship between the urban environment , and to make people good close to nature . 
thank you very much . 
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said to the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche . 
i think there are three things like this . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a broad consensus . 
the second one is : what we should have more 信任感 . 
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task . 
i think people to this proposition , purpose and task that are wrong . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is this proposition , with a purpose and a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ? 
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls poll , to find out about 信任感 in decline . 
but when you really look at different times polls , actually , not many evidence supporting this idea . 
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and the politicians , still don &apos;t be trusted . 
and 20 years ago is highly trust people , for example , and the nurse , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in society 居中 on these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
poll records , of course , is that some people . 
or you can record polls ? 
but that &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , they say . 
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ? 
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot; 
you trust sell fish ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart the ask . 
when you understand what is the problem , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
very rational answer . 
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways for trust . 
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types analysis . what the civil servant , official people , and it will be types . 
for example , i would say , i believe that a , of course , i know elementary school teachers to teach them how to read . but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus . 
maybe , and i know she &apos;s not really a good driver . 
i might believe me , and that love is a drink friends to friends . but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them , he &apos;s a secret to live . 
it &apos;s that simple . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence is 信任感 from , say , well why poll , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ? 
i think poll is a very bad measure 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s a good 抹杀 people to think about 信任感 . poor judgment , poor judgment . 
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ? 
it is we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think that it was ridiculous . 
i think this is not the purpose . 
i would say , it should be trusted people more to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people . 
in fact , i said it was trying not to trust not trusted people . 
for example , who put themselves to the savings that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money roll out 麦道 夫 people , and i think , that &apos;s how people say that , right , so easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
smart , smart trust and trust to choose not to be true purpose . 
so some people say , well , ok , this is not the most important not to trust , but reputation of ? 
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy . 
i think , to make decisions about the need to think about three . 
to see if they ? it allows you to be honest , whether reliable ? 
if we think that allows you to a person is , in his own area is . it allows you to be honest , reliable . we have reason to believe that they , because they &apos;re reliable . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not to help me , and they send messages , because they &apos;re forget . 
i some very confident friends , they can do it , but i think some of them too confident . 
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest . 
perhaps there , i haven &apos;t found . 
we need is before : trust to look at his reputation of . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the rules , is to be a professional level or official on these making it easier for us to determine whether a reputation . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like they have to do things like that . 
i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 接生 than a child and hard . &quot; 
in our public life , our institutions in life , we find a lot of questions . the institution accountability needs in this system to protect his reputation as can be trusted by institutions to see , it &apos;s the opposite . 
it allows people to focus their work , like 助产士 them , and they take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned . 
you actually have this experience . 
purpose to talk about lots and lots of . 
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgments , is rapidly response , are attitude , not all of you here . 
and third , about the task . 
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got the . 
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust . 
well , we can do for ourselves . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but off the what , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from others . 
you can &apos;t fix people say to you . 
you need to do with trying to make people 家信 let you . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
and of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful by , and people know that you are trustworthy . 
how to do that ? 
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work . 
i give you just a simple , for example , marketing . 
there is a store said i was able to buy me come back , they never ask any questions . 
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me change color is my favorite socks . 
it &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me think they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a good trustworthy an idea . say to yourself , you have confidence . 
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell . 
whether people to trust is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
john 科林 托克斯 : the film manhood . 
as the father made me happy , is they like to see the film . 
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
and then a few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
and she put their dressed like as 仙女 was holding 魔杖 . 
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll find this film is so special . 
now , we live , raise kids , are in a fantastic children into a complicated world . 
but the 绿野 仙 &quot; 独树一帜 spaces . 
it &apos;s not like that . 
this trend is 40 years later today to pop . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 毛绒绒 and a guy to mimic the enemy of safeguard to save a girl . 
you know that this is what film ? ... 
right . 
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different , &quot; 绿野 仙 to track , &quot; we see all the film in recent years of 两三 there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first of all , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients . 
it &apos;s the sort of violence , and this apple . 
but i think if we &apos;re taking the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of people . 
use your magic slippers to beat bad 巫婆 military . &quot; 
but , it &apos;s not like that . 
&quot; 绿野 仙 unique spaces , &quot; sex and the image of the most heroic , intelligence , even the bad guys are women . 
i was in a few years later , together with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; , realized this , that &apos;s when there are different . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
it was three . 
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him look . 
but as a second child at home , for his watch it &apos;s sort of a lot . 
and he also run in , and then the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck are born with the duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this film . but he clearly i became obsessed with this . 
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons . 
which is film out of courage , tenacity and faithful ? 
also , or 卢克 joins the army , to remove the government ? 
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
dorothy is how to win ? 
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders . 
and i hope to their children in this environment -- oz world -- growing up , and it &apos;s not up to play to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality . 
why do we show kids movies have so much violence so little yellow brick way ? 
about men &apos;s violence on film for women , a lot of good analysis article , you should look at . write very well . 
this boy on to the atmosphere , i read the article not that much . 
and my own experience , 从莱娅 are for the environment guide me not to get to experience in real life adults to children into the adult world is &quot; men and women of 混居 . &quot; 
i think , on the screen beginning to happen in the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
i do a mission , won 芳 heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t know what to do . 
these films focus on the beat the bad guys get reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 . 
and of course , the example is a lot , and i &apos;ll in front of you for disney princess are defense . 
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not these films expected audience . 
these films , there &apos;s a big all because it &apos;s taught girls against 父权 how society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society . 
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 . 
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to all of you recommend this film . now are being shown in . 
you remember the brave legends criticism , &quot; just project ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 and started to do the movies . &quot; 
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , these films almost nothing , by &quot; 贝克德 test . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
this test for not known , but today , maybe we can do them . 
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her and a friend in and they saw the movie about content . 
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
think about the standard . 
if , these women role in the film is talking about ? 
if you have to , with their common 心上人 talk about it ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women , to have to speak , there . 
it &apos;s this film . i &apos;ve seen in , but we &apos;ve seen , and like the film is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a good quality of the movie &quot; the 阿尔戈 . &quot; 
oscar the film , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film plot , most of what &apos;s happening in has been hijacked 人质 events in big 使馆 , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see , for scene in which men to be profound and full of anxiety conversation . and movie actor , a woman in the nice story is the door and said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot; 
this is hollywood . 
to look at the numbers . 
the most popular 2011 ago 100部 movies , how many film a heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
but just picked congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , that &apos;s so good . 
so this ratio , higher than that , and that &apos;s going to let you in shock . 
last year , new york times published a paper done by the government . 
here &apos;s the content . 
the united states every five women in a 性骚扰 ever met . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s in entertainment , had wrong . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s for children to film . 
i even think porn music and movie with this is not just relationships , but there &apos;s a problem . when i hear the statistics , i was thinking about is the number of 性骚扰 was so much . 
they &apos;re who ? how they were teaching out ? 
they learned leaks ? 
they have don &apos;t have to understand the film plot men , a hero beat 残暴 反派 and get the glory and reward -- is not a friend and not speak woman ? 
we have to learn from the story of what ? 
you know , as a father and daughter to have , i told you all the parents , people like to the statistics and save the world , we &apos;re going to be in 危机感 prevent them . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be a very important way , i mostly for my father said . 
i think we should for our boys to show you a new manhood . 
now the manhood is defined by putting the cart before the horse . 
you already know the new economy is women environment change his family home men 胡口 role . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters , you know , she said , who ? 
than 欧 -- wangari 
wangari , than 欧 -- and the 葛琳 than and up to 
what they have in common ? 
maybe there &apos;s no relationship with beautiful clothes . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their own movies than others have more knowledge with others , and to share their knowledge that helped potential for other people . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i want my daughter &apos;s pursuit of this , we hope to my son &apos;s pursuit of this . 
i hope this for more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism . 
i want to tell you a story about a little kid . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know his story . 
he lives in the south , in a village . 
it &apos;s a village 加迪休 from the capital . 
this little village , because it &apos;s been dry so 食不果腹 poor people . 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities . 
he just to , no opportunity , no , no prospects . 
and only lived in a tent that &apos;s 加迪休 town in the country . 
about a year in the past , it &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch . 
he &apos;s alive with a bunch of people , and he got off . 
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes , can give their own native to send money . 
and he introduced to a young girl . 
and they did . 
he started new life . 
he lives have goals . 
one day in &apos;s 加迪休 in the sky 碧蓝 happened a car bombing . 
this is the city of my little boy is that the bomb , and when that help dynamic people &apos;s &quot; the party , &quot; a and al qaeda a terrorist organization . 
this little boy just want to go through a city through why he is the story of a suicide attack for the end ? 
he actually wait . 
he was a chance to wait for the future of his waiting for a can move road , and that &apos;s his first had to go . 
this is going to be like 成年期 him from waiting for the first encounter . 
and his story was in over the world with different downtown . 
this is a story about power , taken from the urban youth unemployment story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out of things . 
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means job opportunities , wealth , but not to enjoy their young people in the city . 
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment . 
in 2030 , five people living in cities , there &apos;s three is to 18 these people . 
if we in urban development , not to young people think , of course , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and gang these 雷池 is going to be the future of cities . 
i was born in the city &apos;s 加迪休 , 70 percent of the people in unemployment . 
no , no book 70 percent . 
basically do nothing 
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing that are full of play eye hospital in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it be ? 
if i get to in the same waiting 成年期 ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
and i did say no . 
i came last month &apos;s 加迪休 reason to do is actually a young leadership and entrepreneurship summit . 
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership 
we sat down and working together solution to a city of the biggest problem . 
one in the room called aden young people . 
he &apos;s 加迪休 at the university and graduated . 
there was no job , no opportunity . 
i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work very frustrated , is &quot; the party &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit . 
the people that look like this . 
but he story , it &apos;s another version 
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , to the big obstacle is the 
23 years of civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , it actually became the easy-to-use tools . 
aden find opportunities and grab it on . 
he built a motorcycle company . 
actually , to a cab to the people who couldn &apos;t afford motorbikes . 
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆 
he &apos;s the story of how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i believe , is he going to find opportunities and opportunity . 
this is entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is waiting for 成年期 with the most effective tool . 
he drove young people as they had been crazy searching for economic opportunity makers 
you can put people into training . 
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a conference he called mohamed mohamoud is a 名花 business . 
he was to train in my business summit part of the young people how to grow them how to create entrepreneurial innovation . 
if you ask people , &quot; you see what &apos;s the flowers , ? &quot; for a lot of was born in civil war , who was the answer is going to be , &quot; never seen before . &quot; 
so mohamed from that opportunity . 
he started a 园林 and greening and design companies . 
he &apos;s in 加迪休 go out on a agriculture , and he started to grow tulip 百合花 and he said that it &apos;s a bad 加迪休 to climate . 
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in town , business and busy . now he &apos;s busy building 加迪休 22年 &apos;s the first citizens park . 
now , there &apos;s no citizens 加迪休 &apos;s in park . 
he wanted to create a space for family young people together , to here , as he said , to feel and enlightenment 花香 rose . 
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep . 
they don &apos;t want to business . 
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he of innovation , for those people very big . 
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the cities . 
he makes them think they can be entrepreneurs can be changing the world . 
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city and some of the most tricky . 
they came up with a business solution to local problems . 
so young companies to create a culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas . 
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business . 
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them from idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for cities 
for me , entrepreneurship is not just open business 
it &apos;s about creating social impact . 
it &apos;s not just in sell doctor-heroes 
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling . 
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , and will truly change people to the city . 
on the side of the street aden hired to help him a cab and help keep the motorcycle 
he gave them the opportunity to escape from was to get 成年期 wait . 
these young . all right , they have a profound impact on the city . 
so my suggestion is that move more young people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , so you have to spend more and more peace park story . it &apos;s not the car bomb 成年期 and wait . 
thank you . 
薛晓岚 : easy to learn how to read the chinese word for . 
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , and one of the most precious memory is for my mother showed the chinese word for the beauty of form of care . 
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language . 
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to china as 高不可攀 wall . 
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how we can tackle this wall , and to understand that language and look at this complex elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way to learn , the chinese word for . 
from five up , i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book . 
in every day , i was 15 years to learn new the chinese word for . 
because we are only five minutes time , should have a much more easy faster way of learning . 
a chinese scholar 二万个 the chinese word for that . 
you just need to know the chinese word for a thousand , can read simple literature . 
that the chinese word for 二百个 to the top , you know -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read and sign to understand chinese restaurant menu , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
today i use the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
put your mouth is better get bigger , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words . 
this is a man was walking . 
&quot; one &quot; words . 
this is a trees . 
&quot; carpenter . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; signs like wild about comfort in a couple of cars on the door . 
i call this eight words for basic words . 
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
a &quot; people . &quot; 
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
there is a saying that , people from two to three people , for you . 
if somebody open arms , this people say , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; in , the people were stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about get stuck in whales in the stomach . 
tree is &quot; carpenter . &quot; &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot; 
three trees together , is &quot; the forest . &quot; 
put a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot; 
remember to very easy , because a will talk of the trees are very 呆傻 things . 
remember &quot; fire ? &quot; 
&quot; fire 两团 &quot; together , it becomes very &quot; hot . &quot; 
&quot; fire 三团 &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much . 
to put the fire &apos;s two trees , &quot; burn . &quot; 
for us , everything from the sun &apos;s life . 
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around . 
the sun three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot; 
when the sun and the moon in these together , and that &apos;s &quot; the light . &quot; 
one day after a night , is &quot; tomorrow . &quot; 
from the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; 旦 . &quot; 
a &quot; door . &quot; and put the block of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot; 
put a 张嘴 on the door , is &quot; ask . &quot; 
&quot; bang ! &quot; , people in the home ? 
this is even outside , &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; avoid . &quot; 
the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , maybe have debate . 
three women together , be careful , is it &quot; 姦 . &quot; 
we &apos;ve learned about the chinese word for 30 . 
and through this way , this eight basic words can secondary out into 32 the chinese word for . 
the next eight of the chinese word for a crime , and the chinese word for 32 . 
so , you can very easy to learn hundreds of the chinese word for eight years old , this is the chinese children of chinese language . 
these words in school later , we started to build a phrase . 
for example , take &quot; the &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcanoes . &quot; this is &quot; volcanoes . &quot; 
we know that japan is the sun rises place . 
and here the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china . 
so to the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot; 
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; people , we get what ? &quot; 
&quot; the japanese . &quot; 
the words of a mountain , and those two are together . 
in the ancient china , which means 流亡 , because the clothes out in the 政敌 to them . 
today , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go out . &quot; 
&quot; a &quot; and &quot; tell you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot; 
this slide , it reminds me of the talk , and walking down the table . thank you .
