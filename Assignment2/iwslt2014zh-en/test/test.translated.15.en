meg jay : why 30 20 is not new . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need psychiatric patient treatments . 
and i was a university in berkeley read the ph clinical psychologist . 3d student . 
she was a woman named alex 26 . 
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she came to me about men &apos;s question . 
when i hear this , i disengaged . 
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk to my boys . 
i thought i could manage this thing . 
but i can &apos;t do that . 
alex in every meeting , will bring funny story , so to me and 点点 head on the results of the time is very easy thing . 
alex would say , &quot; this is a new 20th , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later , in order to have to have children , even after death is to have . 
and i like alex 二十几岁 like people outside , except for nothing . 
but not too long , i have 催 that i started to push alex love life . 
i refuse . 
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the bed dumb , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment . 
and in that moment , i learned 30 二十岁 is not new . 
yeah , more people than ever late 安顿 off , but that doesn &apos;t mean that alex 二十几岁 between , this is her 低谷 development . 
and alex 二十几岁 to develop a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there kill it . 
and then i understood that &quot; kindness oversight &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love life 二十几岁 around for people with the family . 
now there &apos;s about the 5千万 二十几岁 people . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can &apos;t 二十几岁 experience in this phase circumstances and adult period . 
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand . 
i really wanted to see here , 一些二十几岁 people . 
that &apos;s great ! you &apos;re awesome . 
if you and 二十几岁 people work , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you 二十几岁 because people and lost o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome 二十几岁 , people are very important . 
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime that 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old . 
that means every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment in a place in eight 中旬 30 . 
over 40 years , you don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money , you will make a very big impact . 
we know more than half of america before the 30 终生 and mate married , 同居 , or on a date . 
we know in your brain 二十几岁 , in order to adapt to the second issue adults are the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own what , now is to change its time . 
we know that life than other 二十岁 stage , some of the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do . 
so your 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body and the choice is the time . 
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago is brain development admiration language and the critical period . 
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact of time . 
but we &apos;ve heard a little there &apos;s a thing called adult development , and our 二十岁 this stage is the critical period for adults development . 
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard . 
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change . 
researchers have 二十几岁 called extend adolescence . 
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid , like , &quot; the names , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , and we get is actually the most important decades 期中 adults a doesn &apos;t matter . 
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time . 
this is not right ? 
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ? 
nothing happens . 
you take that guy , and worked urgency , but nothing happening . 
and everybody says , &quot; if i just before the 30 started my career , no problem . &quot; this kind of thing . 
but then they said , &quot; i start 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have the show . 
i graduated that the best 写写 my résumé . &quot; 
and they start 二十几岁 : &quot; when you sit in dating like playing games . 
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but to about 30 music will stop off one after another , you start to sit down . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &quot; chair &quot; . &quot; 
二十几岁 here where people ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
well , that sounds that may seem a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , and very high currency . 
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and as research suggests that started 三十几岁 on this stage and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big . 
on a millennium , middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy . 
my job is not that they want . 
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or unable to their children a long . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people what to do best . 
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do . 
this is a about a name &apos;s emma women story . 
25 emma , because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at . 
because cheap , she and her 脾气 show that worked more and more than my boyfriend live together . 
and whether she 二十几岁 how hard life , she was more difficult . 
she was meeting , often cry , but said , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took her to fill a morning people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this graph ... &quot; &quot; the blank behind . 
she 歇斯底里 close to the looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot; 
and i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment . 
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make a decision emma that 10 years we do it off . 
so in the next weeks and months of , i told the emma three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women are supposed to hear things . 
first , i tell emma forget her identity crisis then accumulate identity capital . 
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value . 
do you want a for what &apos;s going to be investment . 
i didn &apos;t know emma professional future , and nobody knows the future of my own work , but i know that these : identity capital would get to more identity capital . 
this is a professional accept that multinational , that one in and you want to take up to the time . 
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people , but i was exploring 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to tell you cannot called exploration . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count . 
secondly , i told emma cities tribes overestimate . 
the new capital , the new can get almost always about people from inside the external communities . 
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends . 
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment . 
but half is not that connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group . 
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and reach your neighbors boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 to work . 
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about how information on science . 
and finally , emma people don &apos;t choose to believe that a family , but can choose friends . 
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as soon emma 一个二十几岁 , who is going through and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family . 
i told emma choice family time is now . 
you might think , is a 20 , 30 than 25 , even better of settling down time , and i agreed . 
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your 同居 sleep , or people don &apos;t call progress . 
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which is treated with love is going to work as rich as consciousness . 
choice family is conscious choices you want to people and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose the person you waste your time . 
and how that emma ? 
well , we made it into the address thin , and she found her an old roommate , a family in another in an art museum work . 
the faint . she was there for a job . 
and that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons . 
now , the past five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and her consciously a chosen people get married . 
she loved her new career , she loved his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now 联系人 emergence , not to be a big fence . &quot; 的卡 pieces . 
emma story to this thing sounds very simple , but this is my favorite 二十几岁 and the reason why people work . 
it &apos;s so easy to help them . 
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport go somewhere in the west flights . 
after the fly , a little challenging is falls in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s the difference . 
likewise , or even in 21 29岁 is 25 , a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 and a few generations , maybe even a very big impact . 
this gives a worth spreading , you know , for every 二十几岁 one idea . 
and it &apos;s what i learned to alex saying as simple . 
don &apos;t get you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re in determines your life . 
thank you . 
李镇河 李镇河 : into the computer : &quot; really &quot; infinite world , to your imagination 
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s our real world and the gap between the virtual world , in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , it &apos;s as thin touchscreen glass , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the good ? 
so i started to try this crazy idea . 
i first made that tool , it can go digital space , if you take a pen that using force on the screen , and a pen pen and will go into a by pixels of virtual worlds . 
designers directly in three-dimensional space for their ideas , the surgeon can practice on the screen for organs inside virtual surgery . 
so , this is a tool that broke the virtual and real world of boundaries . 
but we are in the hands out . 
how can we reach into to interact with digital information , we have to use my hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer put on top of a small space to work within the least numbers . 
because in reality window and file space is , pick exactly where they become like shelves from a book , and so easily . 
and you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands , spinning stretched of models . 
in this example that we &apos;re in the digital world . 
but how we can transform it to make the role of the digital information into our world ? 
in the room that many people have online shopping 退货 and experience . 
but now than you don &apos;t worry about . 
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 online . 
this is the system analyzing our body geometry , after we drive through a head or a way to look at that show us situations . 
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make space that we see a little pixels shifting to actually get to touch , feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve persian 雷米 together , make it a &quot; matter a little pixels . &quot; 
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 as we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and the objects that people will move into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place . 
so how do we eliminate gravity , is to pellets role , and it &apos;s magnetically levitated mechanical drive and goes into a combination of technology to control pellets movement . 
and for this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , the movement of the people in the world of matter that can be recorded , back and forever , keep . 
so , it can be remote 编排 dance , and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action over and over again , and you can actually be repeated itself . 
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force . 
more exciting , it &apos;s not the computer is put things into a real stuff , but programming world to imagine , even going to change our everyday physical activity . 
and as you can see , digital information will not take things for us , but that &apos;s going to start working on us directly to become part of our physical environment , not cut our relationship with the real world . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can take the border , the rest is we enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
&apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 had two 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years . 
when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 体校 转学 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 体校 转学 , all free . 
my mother said , &quot; no , the tiger . &quot; 
my parents , and i hope they as long as the engineers . i want my elephant their parents , as long as engineers . 
as 文革 survivor , they only get -- think happiness is a reliable way 高薪 security . 
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter . 
but i dream is becoming 黄梅戏 actor . 
that &apos;s my premise playing the piano . 
戏曲 actor to start learning from small 身段 kung fu 戏曲 actor , to start to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i wanted to do everything 黄梅戏 to go to school . 
even write 戏校 principal with a radio host . 
but there was a big people love that idea . 
not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious . 
only 小伙伴 and they supported me , but they also a child , and i did powerless . 
was 15 , i know i &apos;m going to learn how to play is too much older . 
my dream is no longer going to do . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ah ! my god . 
i decided to dark for our search for another mission . 
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learned from the book . 
&#91; &quot; 三毛 全集 南怀瑾 &quot; and &quot; historical experience , &quot; i 1995 -- to the united states in the united states , what i first read a book ? 
of course , is 禁书 china . 
the earth , &quot; tell the story of farmers . 
you &apos;re not really convenient propaganda . okay . 
bible interesting , but also very strange . 
the topic 他日 and talk about . 
but the ten commandments fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; that &apos;s not and more than &quot; submission . &quot; 
it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool , it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool , and i rebuild the relationship with their parents . 
to a new environment , as a culture , and i read habits , to a new culture and environment for me to read a habit . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from small to large use world map . 
i &apos;ve never realized , it doesn &apos;t necessarily need to china in the middle of a world map . 
it turns out that maps with a view . 
compare reading is not new . 
it &apos;s in the academic standard practice . 
比较文学 , compare that to be religious even field 比较文学 . a religion , even become specialized research . 
but let academics control for a project has a full understanding . contrast control let academics for a project has a full understanding . 
i wonder , as compared with reading on useful , why not use it in daily life ? 
so i started putting a book about to read . 
they can be about the same event , different parties , they can be about the same event , different parties , or two a shared experience , friends . 
jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desire and fear and social responsibility -- interesting . 
if you understand the language , take your favorite books version two languages , and compare it &apos;s very interesting . 
and the translator 默 thomas . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 de watts translation of the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost , i actually found one translation can lead to harvest . 
for example , translating that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning , but it &apos;s called &quot; rapid joy , &quot; well ... 
chinese bride , &quot; the literal meaning word for &quot; it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
books , and has become an amazing discovery 今人 communication has become a portal , books and 今人 lack of communication , a magic . 
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless . 
other people &apos;s suffering , than 破灭 dream . not what other people &apos;s suffering , than what 破灭 dream not . 
i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose . 
it &apos;s the most important for our goal is to touch dream sources of places where the source , passion , happiness sources of places . 
even a broken 灭 dreams can also make your experiencing that touch . 
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , live happily living , purpose and meaning to become clear , in most of the time . 
and always wish to you at any age . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
帕鲁尔 de 塞加尔 : envy 颂歌 . 
when i was eight , classes new to a woman . she &apos;s compelling , like all new girls to that . 
she had a lot of the 光泽 秀发 a cute little 文具盒 specialize in a week , the capital that name on the spell that no one can than 
that year , i was the people were envy until i figured out that evil . 
i &apos;m from school one day after the second 逗留 and leave it to a night , i &apos;ve been silently sit on the toilet 
and at that time , i would go from a classroom teachers 出动 table scores for it . 
and i conspiracy win by stopping . 
and i change my opponents scores only is it a little bit , take some a 降级 wait . 
well , it &apos;s all a 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other students are high score to awfully ! 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all the way , but not and creativity 
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line in it , because i &apos;ve got to do some more radical . 
now i don &apos;t understand my behavior . 
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out . 
i don &apos;t know why it &apos;s wonderful to do that . 
i was feeling great . 
i don &apos;t know why i had never been found 
i mean , this thing to do so . 
i hasn &apos;t been found . 
but it &apos;s important is , why i care about this girl , in this tiny little girl , and at the spell ? this point , and i was baffled . 
envy threw me 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that babies are the envy torture 
and that primates envy , very comfortable envy 知更鸟 blue . 
we know the murder jealous spouse agents . 
but i never read an research could explain , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s lonely and there , or the brutal . 
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
well , i don &apos;t know it &apos;s not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have a literary ? 
if not 忠 ocean , it &apos;s not the odyssey . &quot; 
no 妒忌 where the king , there is no &quot; 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we have 书单 reading high school , because we &apos;re losing a 喧嚣 &quot; with &quot; are losing the amazing gates than &quot; is the sun rises , &quot; are losing 包法利 &quot; lady , &quot; &quot; anna 卡列琳 nathalie . &quot; 
no , no 普鲁斯 jealous . now , i mean , i know that people always say , love 普鲁斯 knew everything , but said he really jealous of this thing is . 
this is his 巨著 追忆 &quot; with &quot; water 年华 一百周年 this piece is about sex jealous of the research also well we can think of common 竞争性 , which is me at that . 
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we will think about the emotional . right ? 
we think about a boy is 入梦 
think about a 玛德琳 衣草茶 薰 on the cake . 
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye . 
he &apos;s so cold , no compassion 
these books in virginia 伍尔夫 , it seems like a cat gut . 
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it 坚 as 顽石 . 
let &apos;s look at these things come together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and 普鲁斯 and there &apos;s envy . 
妒忌 up to people , and from that desire to become a firm foundation narrative is not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it profoundly push our sensitive nerve because just think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we feel envy , we &apos;ll make a story . 
tell a story about someone living these stories make us feel bad because they were just to let the &apos;d suffered . 
we tell ourselves as stories , and the audience know exactly where join in the details where 一刀 lethal . right ? 
envy , let &apos;s have a novelist amateur 普鲁斯 , and that can understand . 
all she did what i &apos;m happy thing is going to give someone happy . it &apos;s happening now ? &quot; 
this is what he started to their stories and crochet 普鲁斯 , the portraits , every lover of that he &apos;s a new glamour him , &quot; sexual 虐 密室 together in a series of tools . &quot; 
now we have to admit , 斯万 普鲁斯 and there &apos;s two people infamous . 
you know , the 普鲁斯 , if they want to talk to my boyfriend 分手 that he had to escape from this country . 
but you don &apos;t need so envy will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
envy where you &apos;re body 疲 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , to get . 
envy like ? 
envy love information . 
like detail . 
like a big put 光泽 秀发 文具盒 cute . 
envy love . 
this is the reason that instagram . 
there are actually 普鲁斯 academic language with envy 相联 language . 
when the millions of struggling to his envy , and he started standing in front of him to bribe 偷听 lover servants &apos; quarters his defense for the behavior . 
he said , &quot; hey , i know you think that annoying , but it and interpret a 古文 or watching a memorial no two . &quot; 
he said , &quot; these are the scientific research , a real knowledge value . &quot; 
shame , grief , loss : these are 普林斯 , to wisdom . 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman has made our pain . we all emotions than , let &apos;s interested in a genius , can have more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel woman ? 
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s . 
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotional would allow us to see their own hostility ugly intentions heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that says that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud would think that he and his wife disobedience 憔悴 ours so . 
freud think this guy kind of weird because he doesn &apos;t really concerned with his wife do . 
because his wife was innocent , you know . 
this poor guys just 缘由 , no doubt . 
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move . 
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it &apos;s able to describe this novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right . 
well , our envy more intense , we will be more often . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something illegal or violence . 
envy causes us to become very extreme . 
i admit , i think there &apos;s an eight year-old themselves , but i also on the news came to see a story . 
一个52岁 michigan women were discovered register a facebook account fake and used to account for their malicious sent a year . 
a year . for one year . 
she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before the aisles girlfriend now , i must admit , when i heard it when i was in response she admired 
because , i want to say that , you face reality . 
ah , just how creative in the wrong place , isn &apos;t it ? 
this comes from fiction . 
a 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel . 
海史密斯 is my favorite writers and 
she &apos;s on the extraordinary 文学史 诡 curiosity and a 
for example , tom , but in her case , the most famous . 
里普利 started to you or want what you have , then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in a basement 应答 his name , and you wear your ring spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but we do ? we cannot 里普利 over . 
i couldn &apos;t give a huge change the world , even though i would one day be able to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in admire . 
we live in envy . 
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , isn &apos;t it ? 
it can give us a novel solution ? i &apos;m not sure . 
let &apos;s 学学 fictional characters , to see them on the right thing to meet puzzles and don &apos;t know how they do . 
let &apos;s go back to the b 贝克街 221 夏洛克 ask 福尔摩斯 leonardo 
when people think about his 福尔摩斯 would opponent 里亚蒂 professor -- this crime genius 
but i &apos;ve always liked to 探雷 epidemic 斯垂德 阴险 a face scottish 头子 . he was very 福尔摩斯 need to his intelligence , but hate him . 
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this . 
he &apos;s 雷斯 垂 to help , and to hate him in the case of mysterious 侦破 苦闷 again , always story 
we proud of you . &quot; 
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold your hand 福尔摩斯 
this is 少数几次 福尔摩斯 we see in the way , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it &apos;s like having as a geometry , instead of emotions . 
this minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite 
the next minute they stand in the same . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he had hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if envy is really a geometric to do , a question of how we choose your relationship with other questions ? 
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate somebody talent . 
we &apos;ll chase . 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction 
it has been going on with envy fiction 
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it please . 
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy , millions , there &apos;s 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there . 
we have so good . 
thank you . 
ar de 内格尔 : i found in new york in the trash . 
i was 10 or so , once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a place in the new york in the wild . 
it was really good weather . 
the forest searched twinkling lights . 
shine sunlight , the leaves and 晶莹 like when from the stained glass feet . if you don &apos;t have a way , we have to pretend that we &apos;re at this piece of the first human . 
we eventually got to our camp . 
that &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing . 
and in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing . 
people to camp was too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would 善后 clean for them ? 
the problem has been baffling to me , became a longer sound bite . 
who &apos;s going to clean up we leave the garbage ? 
but you can take this problem on anything you live in a place . 伊斯坦 clean we leave the garbage ? 
in rio cleaned we leave the garbage ? in paris and london ? 
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector cleaned up to 11 , we leave 000吨 trash and 2000吨 &apos;s recycling waste every day . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know who &apos;s doing this work . 
in the sanitation trucks were parked on this in a sense of responsibility for what ? 
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project . 
i was sitting in the car , along the lines on the new york at the office , all the sanitation trucks were parked people live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not 垃圾车 sitting in , and i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 . 
my own manipulate the electric 扫帚 scanners 铲 street , in the snow . 
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process . 
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell . 
there is smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad , but very soon , you will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even a few years of working side worker , their bodies have adapted to try and weekly megatons of garbage . 
so there is at risk . 
with the labor 统计局 report , the sanitation trucks were parked work is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then you figure out why . 
you all day on the road , which are of traffic . 
out of the car just trying to drive more than you , people are not careful . 
the sanitation trucks were parked workers , it was terrible . 
and that &apos;s full of the junk that often poisons 毒物 垃圾车 from comes out , in a terrible harm . 
i also learned the brutal and frightening . 
when you &apos;re walking down the sanitation trucks were parked car 路沿 , in a city , you &apos;ll see you realize that the really like the power of nature itself . 
it never is 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like a breathing loop or form . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked . 
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important workforce . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient every day , and the waste from containers sort of , it will actually poison in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we attacked several 和数 century after decade out to the disease , and to threaten our health . 
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , and we can &apos;t space with new things . that &apos;s it , economic engine would 停歇 , because people consumption down . 
i &apos;m not suggesting that capitalism , i &apos;m here is just that their relationship . 
and the third reason -- is what i call our average and necessary , 经常性 activity speed . 
i mean , in the days , and today , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know that we have a team to work on these things were sitting over there is densest . 
so today i want you to think that the sanitation trucks were parked situation , maybe help . they &apos;re called them please come to talk about how to build a sustainable people , the city . 
i think their work is a noble . 
and every time they really very to work in the street . 
in many cities , they &apos;re wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work . 
you know , they would be to clean up garbage on time . 
they allow us to secure in their work . 
they almost became secure work promise . 
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and waste . anyway , all this work is going to keep stability . 
september 11th , 2001 , the next day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and pull , i was young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 week doing . 
i want to thank him to do this job in that particular days , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , and again , i met this guy . 
his name was 保利 times , we have been working together , you become friends . 
i want to believe that 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we as part of this planet , we need to work very hard to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
the city , that we know of garbage actually the amount of waste is only three percent . 
this is an amazing data . 
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the trash , please find a time 致意 to them . 
find a time to say thank you . 
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory . 
please close your eyes to me . 
imagine you &apos;re standing outside your door . 
please 一下门 attention color and materials . 
now , imagine a naked people on the overweight . 
going on a naked cycling to your front door , and it heads . 
to try to imagine 近在眼前 alive . 
they &apos;re 奋力 to hit the pedal 汗流浃背 road 颠簸 very 
and then 径直 hit in your front door . 
四下 bicycle wheel fly go flying off from your next rolling a spoke into that corner of embarrassing . 
the threshold into 门厅 in the hallway and other parts of the soft comfort . 
the light on the sweet pastry monster . 
he was sitting in this horse 马背 骏马 brown on the positive 招手 you . 
and the 马会 speak . 
you can feel his nose 发痒 鬃毛 blue for you . 
you can smell , he was thrown in your mouth 曲奇 granola grapes . 
around him around , he walked into the living room 
standing in the living room put your imagination to imagine the largest tuned in 小甜甜 britney 
her wear exposed to your coffee table , dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot; 
and with i walked in your kitchen . 
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 to drill out your oven , you go to the track is &quot; 绿野 仙 in 铁皮 dorothy 稻草人 people walking arm in arm with lions 蹦蹦跳跳 on their hands , came to you . 
okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;m going to tell you a annual spring in new york are going to have the unexpected . 
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory . 
a few years ago i 科技类 as a journalist to the competition with this thought about there to be like geeks who &quot; super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot; 
a bunch of 屈指可数 men and women and girls from the old some don &apos;t notice personal health 
just look at some 奋力 in a situation hundreds of any to remember the numbers . 
some populations in trying to remember the names of the strangers 
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem . 
and in the game , who is the fastest way laying down 一整副 打乱 card order . 
and i thought that &apos;s amazing . 
these people surely 禀 other talents 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training . 
i asked him , &quot; ed you when you start to realize that they &apos;re memory genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; i don &apos;t mean anything . 
and my memory was . 
the game to every single person will tell you their memory is just generally . 
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot; 
we stood outside the hall 过人 smart amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio on how britney 一整副 remember 打乱 card order . 
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me ! 
we had to find a man , why not ? &quot; 
and then a very peculiar journey unfold in front of me 序幕 . 
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and research on the memory , i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again and other hidden remember exactly what the potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he suffers amnesia his memory was probably the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia is very surprising . 
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can learn memory in any way , shape our personality . 
this is another extreme i met this one . 
his name is kim peek 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; characters in . 
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library back and i think is just fascinating phone books . 
and i went back home and i read a lot in papers write about memory 两千多年 ago in latin wrote papers from ancient until then , during the medieval 
and i learned a lot of interesting things . 
one is used to train illegal beam nurturing memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 people want to send their memory 不遗余力 can in their hearts . 
these technologies for modern life possible , but also changed our 
not just in the culture , and i think in cognitive . 
kids don &apos;t need to remember that sometimes we already forgot how to memory . 
in this place on earth are very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam culture that memory of an extraordinary memory . 
it &apos;s not that extraordinary to do this all over the world . 
i was fascinated with that these people want to know how to do it . 
a few years ago london school of a university researchers asked to a contest to study memory . 
they want to figure out what those people tell us whether somebody else &apos;s brain in anatomically structure different ? 
the answer is no 
and they are smarter than us ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny . 
but compared with the goal is to control the challenges of our brain . there &apos;s a really interesting is that the different . 
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory digital or 人脸 or kind of memory , researchers found that there are challenges activated brain region is not with people . 
notice that they think , is in the brain in space memory and navigation will , in part . 
why ? what can we figure out what kind of thing ? 
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward 白热化 . every year , someone with more effective memory show 赛场 and other ways to catch up . 
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there . 
in his 台前 三十六副 打乱 sequence a card for an hour , he would get all the use of his own invented it , he would have the skills . 
and it &apos;s in the same way that he had a word , not bad back off binary numbers 4140个 any folding only half an hour . 
a cow . 
in the competition of 参赛者 using a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all the skills to finally have into a conceptual psychologists call a delicate code . &quot; 
this idea to humor with a paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox of simple is that i had two people to remember one word to you and i said , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot; 
that &apos;s a baker . 
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot; 
after a while back and i find you ask , &quot; remember what i call you remember before the word ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what word ? &quot; 
they were told 人名 baker &apos;s people remember that term potential away , not as being told a baker that person . 
the same word cause different memories . 
what is , why ? 
because without any particular 人名 baker . 
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any . 
but baker used it as a noun that we all know what &apos;s baker 
baker with funny white cap . 
they hand and ourselves . 
they came home from work with a toast 扑鼻 . 
maybe some people have friends are baker 
we first hear this word , immediately produce all kinds of ways that allow us to after a while , can still remember . 
this precise memory skills 两千五百年 in front of the ancient greeks have . 
and call it through . 
developed this technique of this process is a simonides called the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party 
and he was being asked to do , because in the performing guest in the fancy party cool standard , not just d. j. to beat reduction , but to please poet ode to . 
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died . 
not all death all of them were come down on 面目全非 to 
nobody says that you have to have some of the people who don &apos;t like to tell who &apos;s sitting 
that causes the body can &apos;t get 殉葬 place . 
and then this reinforce the whole thing tragedy colors . 
simonides standing outside of as being close your eyes , only survivors thrust upon realizing in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 are sitting . 
he was hold the hand of the relative to the site and they brought up to us . 
simonides 醒悟 thrust upon the things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we can &apos;t name the phone to remember every word or colleagues command , we all have very keen visual or space memory . 
if i ask you to recap 逐字逐句 i showed you before simonides story about 10 words should not many people will remember . 
but i bet you now , if i put down your back in the foyer . sat will speak 骏马 brown on who you understand what i mean . 
this advice from the latin 两千多年 ago , the first memory . 
so this phrase principles , what is this ? 
suppose you were invited to stand in the center of the ted stage , and you want to talk 脱稿 西塞罗 like in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the general 霸气 that he would go one , and you want . 
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their 
and imagine working with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster mr. ed sitting on the back . 
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends cook ed 
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney you would like to talk about britney of that little story . 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topics are you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association 
this is presenting rome home reciting 稿 secret , which is not just a word bad would just text reciting 添麻烦 flat , but remember , one by one . 
that phrase : &quot; the theme &quot; comes from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is 古时候 people to talk about rhetorical , or in the space . 
&quot; the phrase &quot; means your memories palace 第一层 . 
it &apos;s too much fun for me it up a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started to more detailed 萌发 . it &apos;s about the memory of culture . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is memory process is very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there . 
very exciting moment is not a small source 揉 somebody 揉 . 
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing ! 
i know that these people in the brain is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see 外人 as 
and i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience . 
so i started trying to sit at the morning new york times before 十五 spend 20 minutes to try something . 
put it back . 
back in 跳蚤市场 back , i bought 年鉴 people in the old . 
i was surprised to find it very 带劲 
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise 
it &apos;s goal is not to train memory . 
but you &apos;re trying to produce better creative imagination in your mind working to create the myth is completely funny 胡乱 your memorable . 
and it became my joy . 
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit . 
it &apos;s a 耳塞 镜面 all 护目镜 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory is the biggest enemies attention distributed 
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 . 
i also want to signed up for impulse is just as in sexual news experiment . 
and i thought to be in the when 前言 调侃 about himself . 
the problem is experiment finally got unexpected consequences 
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
back to me now talk or shopping 稿 phone number one is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks memory works is because the human brain 依仗 them some basic principles . 
don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember 几副 the order of the cards and you can actually from understanding brains have some benefits of principle . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 it is not . 
powerful memory is can acquire . 
from the fundamental 专心致志 can keep talking about . 
engaged , can remember 
memory palace , or that memory skills are just 捷径 . 
they &apos;re actually really 捷径 deemed 
this work is because forces you to think about it . 
it forces you to go deeper to make you more focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to the training 
actually 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist . 
this is that we have to remember things . 
by having experiences that i found that our bodies 潜藏 with amazing memory . 
but if you want to live unforgettable is to do a lot of people to remember that . 
thank you . 
who 沃斯 duke pulling lee : success ? willpower . 
on my 27th , and i left a very challenging companies -- to professional management , turn it into a more challenging professional : education . 
i came to some new york city public schools to teach seven grade math . 
and as other teachers , i &apos;ll give students do little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
when these 试卷 assignment and open up , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq , the ups are not my best and the worst students , the only difference between . 
some of the great 课业 in that students don &apos;t have a very high iq points . 
some very smart kids will 课业 in the present less 尽如人意 . 
this got me thinking . 
and of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like rates , small number , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation . 
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , as long as they would spend time and effort . 
after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in education , we need to start learning dynamic perspective and psychological level , the students and learning . take a more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we all know the great evaluating students standards iq is , but if you &apos;re in schools and the good life do than just rely on highly capable of learning for you ? 
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids and adults are , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and the instruments , work , my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they succeeding ? 
i and my research group 西点 point to do research . 
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out . 
we see the first to build a word , but also try to anticipate what kids can level-up in the end game . 
we study in hostile environment for work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students . 
we work with 私企 , they sell to ask what people can stay in . 
what can the more money ? 
in all these different context , a character that no one out , which was largely predicted success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
it &apos;s not nice appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on . 
tenacity is a sustainable 恒 something happened . 
tenacity is you for the future , every day on , is not just for a week or a month , but a few decades trying to struggle for their dream and reality . 
tenacity is put life as a marathon . it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower . 
i &apos;m 千名 on 初中生 conducted a survey , and about willpower waiting for more than a year , and you can look at what graduate students . 
all is not the point , or 西点 in the competition to build the words that willpower . this is also in school , especially for those dropout 徘徊 on the edge of the kids . 
for my own self , about tenacity me the most astonishing thing is heading for willpower . we cognitive , creating tenacity , the scientific understanding that was how poor . 
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and how to mobilize their long-term is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know , talented doesn &apos;t make you gritty heart . 
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , what we see this data , tenacity usually has nothing to do with other factors , even with the brilliance scale run counter . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard about children on developing tough qualities called &quot; the most effective exponential growth mindset . &quot; 
stanford 卡洛杜 william , with a view , and he believed that the human learning can change , it as you try to measure the change . 
杜威克 professor means , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain and its facing challenges , what was happening and grew up , what they fail , more prone to keep going , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure . 
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower . 
but we need more . 
and so i decided to close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is what in front of a job . 
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in back again . 
in other words , we just have to become more tenacity to allow our children to become more willpower . 
thank you . 
steve titus 泽维尔 dimensions and into : local culture . 
as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , will also think about , building around with the environment , buildings , and with their environment , which is the relationship between the tradition . 
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples based on this idea . 
there are two examples in the emerging countries , one in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
one of these cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different ways to make the building analysis , design solutions important components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping malls . 
this is my team and i was the same for example , we were asked to design into this way . 
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do . 
look at the same in this kind of buildings -- the city and a lot of this kind of building -- we found that the most important three questions . 
first , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , people who are not big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because the roads are built outside of glass , this design would be trapped inside heat in architecture , it causes we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this city climate is quite 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 左右. 25度 . 
the third problem is the building looks like one african or ethiopia didn &apos;t matter . 
for a 底蕴 culture and abundance city , it &apos;s called us down . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was so fascinated 集贸市场 local deeply . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the built environment , in the hands of 小商贩 from to buy products . 
this is consistent with my ideas , is in outdoor public setting the idea of creating activities . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 this idea of building ? 
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapidly growing city in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist . 
and this building on the before and after two years ago , in parallel streets 几百米 have little can connected . 
so we need to do is use the buildings that we have portal , all the way to connect these two together . 
and then we have a gradient 庭 of design , created an open architecture space , and this design by its shape to avoid the pedestrian 日晒雨淋 by . 
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same . 
i think , the question is , the buildings outside walls are decorated ? 
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment . 
and i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way , and the light and air to go into the building . 
we went from ethiopia women beautiful pattern in traditional dress got inspiration . 
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls . 
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and control in the way we light into the building . 
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night . 
but we start with these ideas don &apos;t touch the building , and their response , sort of , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all know , the design solutions to than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more shop number . 
and this outside walls design , reduced lots and lots of cost , not just because of this 预制 material cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of the air conditioning to control . 
and we ultimately save part of the budget . 
where is the first question is , think about how to make sure that the building in power , because we live in cities , almost every day 闸 pull . electricity . 
so we were on the roof of solar panels . 
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , and here , in a city oasis 小憩 for people . 
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the building clean . 
we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , well . 
the second example for the tunisian town planning a 2000套 than collateral infrastructure and an apartment building . 
do scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i &apos;m not very deep need to understand the city and tunisia , to understand associated with her of tradition and culture . 
in the process of doing my attention is a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is the structure of history has a brick wall , over thousands of years , there are 12 structure through the door , 相互之间 is almost straight to the road . 
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 primary small areas in size and all the characteristics , similar to what we in barcelona and other european cities common blocks planning . 
in these blocks planning basis , referenced mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , shifted the beginning model . 
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , these kind of a cubicle , is this huge planning basic components . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is the best towards ? 
the answer is 南北朝 to , you can use 南北 house on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we do this kind of model for all the apartments , have the perfect towards . 
this is the effect , as we design a city with the european style , with a combination of residential style . 
some of the building areas with garden , and walk around on the ground and sidewalks to connect . 
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 population density of the population density high , not very expensive . 
and she &apos;s right up to our entry 通性 connected to each other . 
this is the project i &apos;d 得意 part , it &apos;s like to be these buildings takes up space to gave community . 
the community can climb roofs and poke somebody talk to each other , god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or in the back and forth between jump . 
these two in some cases , in the design process with the same way . 
again , they were in the city , you can literally see 拔地而起 little buildings . 
in these cities , architecture for people on it , present and future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate . 
for this reason , i think about architecture in terms of design , the more important , is how , searching for simple solutions , and very cheap enough to enhance and promote the local people and civic relationship , and to make people good close to nature . 
thank you very much . 
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . at first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , and people said that the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche . 
i think there are three things like this . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus . 
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 . 
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task . 
i think people to this proposition , purpose and things that are wrong . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , purpose and in a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is : why people believe that in the lower 信任感 ? 
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls polls , to find out about 信任感 in decline . 
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this idea . 
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and mainly politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted . 
and 20 years ago is highly trust people like the and nurse , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in society 居中 these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
poll records , of course , is that some people . 
or poll can record ? 
but it &apos;s a general attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;re talking about . 
you trust their politicians ? trust ? 
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot; 
you trust sell fish ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart you ask . 
when you understand what &apos;s the problem , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
a very rational answer . 
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways for trust . 
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the civil servant , official people , and it will be types . 
for example , i would say , i certainly believe in an elementary school , i know how to read a teacher will teach students , but i don &apos;t believe that she can run bus . 
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers . 
i might believe me , that love drinking to a friend &apos;s friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , he &apos;s a secret . 
that &apos;s it . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 said , well , we all do polls 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ? 
i think poll is a very bad 信任感 measure whether there &apos;s an idea , because it 抹杀 people to think , well , poor judgment 信任感 poor judgment . 
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ? 
it was , we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think this is pretty funny . 
i think this is not the purpose . 
i would say , they deserve to be trusted more to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people . 
in fact , i said it was trying not to trust not trusted people . 
for example , who put their save something that looks like it &apos;s like they were money to roll out 麦道 夫 sir , i think people who say that ? yeah , yeah , so easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
wise to trust and wise choose not to trust that &apos;s the purpose . 
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important not to trust , but reputation of ? 
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy . 
i think , to make decisions about three right to consider . 
to see if they do ? honest allows you to do ? good ? 
if we think that one allows you to be , in his field allows you to be honest . and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe they , because they &apos;re reliable . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not with them to help me to send messages , because they &apos;re forget . 
i was very confident some friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident . 
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to be reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest . 
perhaps there , i haven &apos;t discovered . 
we need is before : trust to look at his reputation reliability . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the institution , there is a professional level or official demand on these making it easier for us to determine whether there was a reputation . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that . 
i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 接生 than a child &apos;s hard . &quot; 
in our public life , our institutions lives , we find a lot of questions . the institution and accountability for the rules to protect his reputation can &apos;t be trusted as an idea of rules to see it &apos;s the opposite . 
it allows people to focus their work , like 助产士 them , and they take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned . 
you actually had that experience . 
on purpose to talk about a lot . 
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgments , a quick reaction , are attitude , not all of you here . 
and thirdly , about the task . 
the task called rebuild 信任感 . this is another out against . 
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust . 
well , we can do for ourselves . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but off the what , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from each other . 
you can &apos;t fix people say to you . 
you need to do with trying to make people 家信 let you . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
and of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful around , let them know that you are trustworthy . 
how to do that ? 
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work ? 
i give you just a simple business home marketing examples . 
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions . 
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 , or give me change color is my favorite socks . 
it &apos;s good . i trust them , because they make me think they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
for others , if you make myself in vulnerable , this is a good trustworthy an idea . say to yourself , you have confidence . 
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell . 
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
科林 de 托克斯 : the film manhood . 
as the father made me happy , is that you want to see the movie . 
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , and together we saw the 仙 绿野 spaces . &quot; 
the next few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
and she put themselves dressed as like 仙女 was holding 魔杖 . 
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll find this film is so special . 
now , we live , raise kids , are getting immersed in a child a fantastic complex world . 
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot; 
it &apos;s not like that . 
that trend is 40 years later today was popular . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 毛绒绒 and a guy who that enemy to mimic the safeguard to save a girl . 
you know that this is what movie ? ... 
right . 
well , this film , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of different 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; we see with all the film in recent years 两三 ways , there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients . 
they even more violence in there , for instance , like this . 
but i think if we today 绿野 film 仙 tracking , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of people . 
use your magic slippers 巫婆 bad to beat the army . &quot; 
but it &apos;s not like that . 
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; special . it &apos;s shown in the most heroic role , intelligence , even bad people are women . 
i was in a few years later , with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; together , realizing that point , there was a little different things . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
it was three . 
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him to see . 
but as a second child at home , for his care suddenly sort of a lot . 
and he also run in , and then the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck are born with the duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this film . but he clearly i became obsessed with this . 
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons . 
it &apos;s video theme of courage , tenacity and faithful ? 
also 卢克 or joins the army facts about overthrowing a government ? 
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
dorothy is how to win ? 
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders . 
and i hope to their children in this environment -- oz world -- up , not to beat up to the world -- this was a very very close to reality . 
why do we show kids movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ? 
for women &apos;s film about men &apos;s violence impact , a lot of good analysis , you should look at articles written . good . 
the atmosphere for boys impact , i read the article not that much . 
and my own experience , 从莱娅 , what about the environment guide me not getting experience in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; the &quot; 混居 men and women . 
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen at the end of the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
i do a mission , winning 芳 heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t know what to do . 
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 . 
of course , as an example of , and i would in front of you for disney princess they defend . 
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not these films expected audience . 
these films had great all because this is how we teach girls against 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society . 
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 . 
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , including 赫敏 like 特里斯 and kevin and mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i tell you all recommend this film . now are being shown in . 
you remember the brave lore &quot; criticism , the first project ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 also beginning to do the movies . &quot; 
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , almost all of these films , not by &quot; 贝克德 test . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
this test for people who don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do about them . 
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her , and a friend in and they saw the movie about content . 
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
think about the standard . 
if , female characters in movies , to do that ? 
if you talk to them , have in common 心上人 talking about it ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women , to have to speak , there . 
there was this film . i saw , but we &apos;ve seen in and enjoy movies is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen quality of a nice movie 阿尔戈 . &quot; 
oscar the movie , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film , most of what &apos;s happening in plot 人质 has been hijacked events in big 使馆 , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see several scenarios , men are profound and be in conversation with anxiety , and a woman in the movie actor , the nice story is the next door , and said , &quot; you sleep , honey ? &quot; 
this is hollywood . 
look at statistics . 
2011 100部 before the most popular movies , how many film a heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
just picked universal congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , this is a good ratio . 
so this ratio , higher than that , and the percentage of you will get shock . 
last year , new york times published a paper by governments to do . 
here &apos;s the content . 
in the united states every five women have been a 性骚扰 met . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s popular entertainment had wrong . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s for children that movie . 
i even think porn music and movie with that have direct relationships , but something &apos;s wrong . when i heard this , i was thinking about statistics 性骚扰 is the population is so much . 
who are they ? how they were teaching out ? 
they leave school ? 
they have you ever understand this film plot men , a hero beat 残暴 反派 and get the glory and reward -- is a without friends and not speak woman ? 
we have to learn from the story of ? 
you know , as a up with my father , my daughter to tell you all the parents , just like people to the statistics and around the world , we &apos;re going to be 危机感 prevent them . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be a very important way , i was mainly about my father said . 
i think we should for our boys to show you a new manhood . 
now as manhood has putting the cart before the horse . 
you already know new economic environmental changing men , women , his family home 胡口 role . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters , you know , she said , who ? 
wangari 欧 than ... 
欧 than -- wangari steve , sensing than the 葛琳 and 
what they have in common ? 
maybe like beautiful dress , no matter . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their own movies than others have more knowledge with others , and to help people share their knowledge digging potential . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i want my daughter &apos;s pursuit of this , we hope to my son &apos;s pursuit of this . 
i hope this for more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism . 
i want to tell you a story about a little kid . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i knew his story . 
he lived in somalia in a small village 
this is from the capital 加迪休 &apos;s village . 
this little village , because it &apos;s been so poor drought 食不果腹 people . 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the somali 加迪休 &apos;s capital , which is the big cities . 
he had the opportunity , no , no , no prospects . 
and only lived in a tent 加迪休 &apos;s town in the country . 
about a year in the past , it &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat my breakfast and lunch and dinner . 
he &apos;s alive with a bunch of people , and he got rest . 
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes , can give their own native to send money . 
they give him introduced a young girl . 
and they did . 
he started new life . 
he &apos;s life . 
one day in 加迪休 &apos;s 碧蓝 in the sky there was a car bombing . 
this is the city of my little boy is the suicide bombers , and when that help dynamic people are &quot; for youth &quot; and a party and al qaeda terrorist organization relationships . 
this little boy just wanted to go through the city through the story of why he &apos;s a suicide attack for the end ? 
he actually wait . 
he was a chance to wait for the future of his waiting for a can move road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road . 
this is going to be like him from 成年期 waiting for the first encounter . 
and he was in the same story with different center in the world . 
this is a story about power , taken from the story of urban youth unemployment . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out of things . 
for young people , cities with dreams , which means 大城市 to job opportunities , wealth , but not to enjoy their young people in the city . 
more , are young people stand in the unemployment . 
by 2030 , five people living in cities , which has three is a under 18 people . 
if we in urban development , not to think about amazing people , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities for you come across this story 成年期 terrorism and violence and gang 雷池 these will be the future of cities . 
i was born in the city , who &apos;s unemployed in 加迪休 70 percent . 
no , no book 70 percent . 
basically do nothing 
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing that are full of play in front of an eye hospital , i think if i don &apos;t leave it would be ? 
if i get to in the same 成年期 waiting for ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
and i did say no . 
last month , i went back 加迪休 &apos;s why it is to try an obsession with business leadership learn summit 
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership 
we sat down and working together solutions to cities are the biggest problem . 
one in the room called aden young people . 
he &apos;s in 加迪休 on a university and graduated . 
there was no job , nothing . 
and i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , frustration party is &quot; for youth &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit . 
the people that look like this . 
but his story , it &apos;s another version 
in 加迪休 &apos;s from a to b , and the biggest obstacle was the 
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and it actually , it became the easy-to-use tools . 
aden find opportunities and grab it on . 
he built a motorcycle company . 
started a cab motorcycle to the people who buy motorbikes . 
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years 数百辆 spread 
he &apos;s the story of how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i believe is his find opportunities to grasp and opportunity . 
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is about 成年期 waiting for the most effective tool . 
he drove young people as they had been crazy searching for economic opportunity makers 
you can put people into the training . 
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a meeting mohamoud doctor-heroes his name is a 名花 business . 
he was trained in business to help me on the summit of nurturing their creative people how to create entrepreneurship . 
if you ask people , &quot; you see what &apos;s the flowers for a lot of time ? &quot; born in civil wars , who was their answer would be , &quot; never seen . &quot; 
so from the opportunities that doctor-heroes 
he created an 园林 and greening with the design company . 
he &apos;s in 加迪休 go out on a agriculture , and he started to grow tulip 百合花 and as he said that can take a bad climate 加迪休 &apos;s . 
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s busy building 22年 加迪休 &apos;s the first park to citizens . 
now there &apos;s no citizens 加迪休 &apos;s in park . 
he wanted to create a space for family young people together , to be here as he said , to feel and inspire 花香 rose . 
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep . 
they don &apos;t want to business . 
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he innovation for those people very big . 
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city . 
he makes them that they can also be entrepreneurs can also be changing the world . 
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now . 
they came up with a business solution to local problems . 
so young companies to create a culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas . 
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business 
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , they need to shift from idea to create you equivalent to create a catalyst for cities 
for me , entrepreneurship was not on business 
it involves creating social impact . 
not sells flowers on doctor-heroes 
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling . 
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , and will truly change people to the city . 
side street aden hired to help him a cab to help him and maintain the motorcycle 
he gave them the opportunity to escape from was to get 成年期 wait . 
these young entrepreneurs , all of them have a profound impact cities . 
so my suggestion is that move more young people become entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more flowers and peace park story there rather than the car bomb and 成年期 waiting for the story . 
thank you . 
薛晓岚 : easy to learn how to read the chinese word for . 
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , and one of the most precious memory is a mother and i showed the chinese word for the beauty of form of care . 
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language . 
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to china as 高不可攀 wall . 
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how we can tackle this wall , for those who want to understand and look at this complex language elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way , to learn the chinese word for . 
from five up , i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of writing . 
fifteen years time , i learn new the chinese word for every day . 
because we are only five minutes time , should have a much more easy way to learn faster . 
a chinese scholar 二万个 the chinese word for that . 
you just need to recognize the chinese word for a thousand , you can read simple literature . 
that &apos;s 二百个 the chinese word for the top , you know -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read sign , to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
today i use the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
put your mouth is better get bigger , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words . 
this is a man was walking . 
&quot; one word . &quot; 
this is a tree . 
&quot; carpenter . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; sign like wild about comfort pair of cars on the door . 
i call this eight words for basic words . 
it &apos;s a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
the &quot; man . &quot; 
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
a phrase from people , two , three people for the public . 
if somebody open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; in , that people had been stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about get stuck in the whale belly . 
tree is &quot; carpenter . &quot; &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot; 
three trees together , is &quot; forests . &quot; 
take a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 on a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot; 
remember to very easy , because a tree , it &apos;s going to speak 呆傻 things . 
remember &quot; fire &quot; ? 
两团 &quot; fire &quot; together , it becomes very hot , &quot; &quot; . 
三团 &quot; fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much . 
it &apos;s two trees in the next , will &quot; burn . &quot; 
for us , the sun is all sources of life . 
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around . 
the three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot; 
when the sun and the moon these together , and it &apos;s called the light . &quot; 
one day after a night , which is &quot; tomorrow . &quot; 
the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; 旦 . &quot; 
a &quot; door . &quot; and put the block of wood , which is &quot; 门闩 . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot; 
&quot; bang ! &quot; , people in the home ? 
this is even outside , &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; avoid . &quot; 
the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , maybe have debate . 
three women together , be careful , which is as &quot; 姦 . &quot; 
we &apos;ve learned the chinese word for almost 30 . 
and through this way , this eight basic words can secondary up into 32 the chinese word for . 
the next one , the chinese word for eight of the chinese word for another 32 offspring . 
so , you can easy to learn hundreds of the chinese word for eight years old , this is the chinese children of chinese language . 
these are the words in school later , we started learning how to build a phrase . 
for example , the &quot; hill &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcanoes . &quot; this is &quot; volcanoes . &quot; 
we know that japan is the sun rises place . 
and here the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china . 
so the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot; 
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; man , we get what ? 
&quot; the japanese . &quot; 
the word mountains , and there are those two together . 
in the ancient chinese 流亡 , which means , because china clothes 政敌 put in to the mountain . 
nowadays , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go out . &quot; 
one of the word &quot; tells you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot; 
this slide reminds me , to finish , and walking down the table . thank you .
