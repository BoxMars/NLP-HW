meg jay : why 30 20 is not new .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need psychiatric patient treatments .  (2)
and i was a university in berkeley read the ph clinical psychologist . 3d student .  (3)
she was a woman named alex 26 .  (4)
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she came to me about men &apos;s question .  (5)
when i hear this , i disengaged .  (6)
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk to my boys .  (8)
i thought i could manage this thing .  (9)
but i can &apos;t do that .  (10)
alex in every meeting , will bring funny story , so to me and 点点 head on the results of the time is very easy thing .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is a new 20th , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
in order to have to work , marry later , in order to have to have children , even after death is to have .  (13)
and i like alex 二十几岁 like people outside , except for nothing .  (14)
but not too long , i have 催 that i started to push alex love life .  (15)
i refuse .  (16)
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the bed dumb , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment .  (20)
and in that moment , i learned 30 二十岁 is not new .  (21)
yeah , more people than ever late 安顿 off , but that doesn &apos;t mean that alex 二十几岁 between , this is her 低谷 development .  (22)
and alex 二十几岁 to develop a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there kill it .  (23)
and then i understood that &quot; kindness oversight &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love life 二十几岁 around for people with the family .  (24)
now there &apos;s about the 5千万 二十几岁 people .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can &apos;t 二十几岁 experience in this phase circumstances and adult period .  (26)
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand .  (27)
i really wanted to see here , 一些二十几岁 people .  (28)
that &apos;s great ! you &apos;re awesome .  (29)
if you and 二十几岁 people work , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you 二十几岁 because people and lost o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome 二十几岁 , people are very important .  (30)
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human lifetime that 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old .  (32)
that means every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment in a place in eight 中旬 30 .  (33)
over 40 years , you don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money , you will make a very big impact .  (36)
we know more than half of america before the 30 终生 and mate married , 同居 , or on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain 二十几岁 , in order to adapt to the second issue adults are the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own what , now is to change its time .  (38)
we know that life than other 二十岁 stage , some of the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do .  (39)
so your 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body and the choice is the time .  (40)
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago is brain development admiration language and the critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact of time .  (42)
but we &apos;ve heard a little there &apos;s a thing called adult development , and our 二十岁 this stage is the critical period for adults development .  (43)
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
researchers have 二十几岁 called extend adolescence .  (46)
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid , like , &quot; the names , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , and we get is actually the most important decades 期中 adults a doesn &apos;t matter .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time .  (50)
this is not right ?  (51)
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ?  (52)
nothing happens .  (53)
you take that guy , and worked urgency , but nothing happening .  (54)
and everybody says , &quot; if i just before the 30 started my career , no problem . &quot; this kind of thing .  (55)
but then they said , &quot; i start 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have the show .  (56)
i graduated that the best 写写 my résumé . &quot;  (57)
and they start 二十几岁 : &quot; when you sit in dating like playing games .  (58)
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but to about 30 music will stop off one after another , you start to sit down .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &quot; chair &quot; . &quot;  (60)
二十几岁 here where people ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
well , that sounds that may seem a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , and very high currency .  (63)
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure .  (64)
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and as research suggests that started 三十几岁 on this stage and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
on a millennium , middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy .  (66)
my job is not that they want .  (67)
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or unable to their children a long .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people what to do best .  (69)
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do .  (70)
this is a about a name &apos;s emma women story .  (71)
25 emma , because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at .  (73)
because cheap , she and her 脾气 show that worked more and more than my boyfriend live together .  (74)
and whether she 二十几岁 how hard life , she was more difficult .  (75)
she was meeting , often cry , but said , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she bought a new address thin , and she took her to fill a morning people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this graph ... &quot; &quot; the blank behind .  (78)
she 歇斯底里 close to the looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
and i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot;  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make a decision emma that 10 years we do it off .  (84)
so in the next weeks and months of , i told the emma three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women are supposed to hear things .  (85)
first , i tell emma forget her identity crisis then accumulate identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value .  (87)
do you want a for what &apos;s going to be investment .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma professional future , and nobody knows the future of my own work , but i know that these : identity capital would get to more identity capital .  (89)
this is a professional accept that multinational , that one in and you want to take up to the time .  (90)
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people , but i was exploring 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to tell you cannot called exploration .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count .  (93)
secondly , i told emma cities tribes overestimate .  (94)
the new capital , the new can get almost always about people from inside the external communities .  (95)
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends .  (96)
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment .  (97)
but half is not that connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group .  (98)
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and reach your neighbors boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 to work .  (99)
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about how information on science .  (100)
and finally , emma people don &apos;t choose to believe that a family , but can choose friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as soon emma 一个二十几岁 , who is going through and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family .  (102)
i told emma choice family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a 20 , 30 than 25 , even better of settling down time , and i agreed .  (104)
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your 同居 sleep , or people don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which is treated with love is going to work as rich as consciousness .  (106)
choice family is conscious choices you want to people and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose the person you waste your time .  (107)
and how that emma ?  (108)
well , we made it into the address thin , and she found her an old roommate , a family in another in an art museum work .  (109)
the faint . she was there for a job .  (110)
and that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons .  (111)
now , the past five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners .  (112)
she and her consciously a chosen people get married .  (113)
she loved her new career , she loved his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now 联系人 emergence , not to be a big fence . &quot; 的卡 pieces .  (114)
emma story to this thing sounds very simple , but this is my favorite 二十几岁 and the reason why people work .  (115)
it &apos;s so easy to help them .  (116)
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport go somewhere in the west flights .  (117)
after the fly , a little challenging is falls in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s the difference .  (118)
likewise , or even in 21 29岁 is 25 , a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 and a few generations , maybe even a very big impact .  (119)
this gives a worth spreading , you know , for every 二十几岁 one idea .  (120)
and it &apos;s what i learned to alex saying as simple .  (121)
don &apos;t get you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition .  (122)
now , you &apos;re in determines your life .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
李镇河 李镇河 : into the computer : &quot; really &quot; infinite world , to your imagination  (125)
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s our real world and the gap between the virtual world , in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , it &apos;s as thin touchscreen glass , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there .  (127)
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the good ?  (128)
so i started to try this crazy idea .  (129)
i first made that tool , it can go digital space , if you take a pen that using force on the screen , and a pen pen and will go into a by pixels of virtual worlds .  (130)
designers directly in three-dimensional space for their ideas , the surgeon can practice on the screen for organs inside virtual surgery .  (131)
so , this is a tool that broke the virtual and real world of boundaries .  (132)
but we are in the hands out .  (133)
how can we reach into to interact with digital information , we have to use my hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer put on top of a small space to work within the least numbers .  (135)
because in reality window and file space is , pick exactly where they become like shelves from a book , and so easily .  (136)
and you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands , spinning stretched of models .  (138)
in this example that we &apos;re in the digital world .  (139)
but how we can transform it to make the role of the digital information into our world ?  (140)
in the room that many people have online shopping 退货 and experience .  (141)
but now than you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 online .  (143)
this is the system analyzing our body geometry , after we drive through a head or a way to look at that show us situations .  (144)
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make space that we see a little pixels shifting to actually get to touch , feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve persian 雷米 together , make it a &quot; matter a little pixels . &quot;  (147)
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 as we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and the objects that people will move into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place .  (148)
so how do we eliminate gravity , is to pellets role , and it &apos;s magnetically levitated mechanical drive and goes into a combination of technology to control pellets movement .  (149)
and for this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , the movement of the people in the world of matter that can be recorded , back and forever , keep .  (150)
so , it can be remote 编排 dance , and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action over and over again , and you can actually be repeated itself .  (151)
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force .  (152)
more exciting , it &apos;s not the computer is put things into a real stuff , but programming world to imagine , even going to change our everyday physical activity .  (153)
and as you can see , digital information will not take things for us , but that &apos;s going to start working on us directly to become part of our physical environment , not cut our relationship with the real world .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can take the border , the rest is we enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)

not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious .  (169)
only 小伙伴 and they supported me , but they also a child , and i did powerless .  (170)

my dream is no longer going to do .  (172)
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness .  (173)
injustice ah ! my god .  (174)
i decided to dark for our search for another mission .  (175)

the earth , &quot; tell the story of farmers .  (180)
you &apos;re not really convenient propaganda . okay .  (181)

the topic 他日 and talk about .  (183)
but the ten commandments fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot;  (184)
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; that &apos;s not and more than &quot; submission . &quot;  (185)
it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool , it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool , and i rebuild the relationship with their parents .  (186)
to a new environment , as a culture , and i read habits , to a new culture and environment for me to read a habit .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from small to large use world map .  (189)
i &apos;ve never realized , it doesn &apos;t necessarily need to china in the middle of a world map .  (190)
it turns out that maps with a view .  (191)
compare reading is not new .  (192)
it &apos;s in the academic standard practice .  (193)
比较文学 , compare that to be religious even field 比较文学 . a religion , even become specialized research .  (194)
but let academics control for a project has a full understanding . contrast control let academics for a project has a full understanding .  (195)
i wonder , as compared with reading on useful , why not use it in daily life ?  (196)
so i started putting a book about to read .  (197)
they can be about the same event , different parties , they can be about the same event , different parties , or two a shared experience , friends .  (198)

and the translator 默 thomas . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 de watts translation of the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost , i actually found one translation can lead to harvest .  (202)
for example , translating that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning , but it &apos;s called &quot; rapid joy , &quot; well ...  (203)
chinese bride , &quot; the literal meaning word for &quot; it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god !  (204)
books , and has become an amazing discovery 今人 communication has become a portal , books and 今人 lack of communication , a magic .  (205)
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless .  (206)
other people &apos;s suffering , than 破灭 dream . not what other people &apos;s suffering , than what 破灭 dream not .  (207)
i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose .  (208)
it &apos;s the most important for our goal is to touch dream sources of places where the source , passion , happiness sources of places .  (209)
even a broken 灭 dreams can also make your experiencing that touch .  (210)

so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all the way , but not and creativity  (226)
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line in it , because i &apos;ve got to do some more radical .  (227)
now i don &apos;t understand my behavior .  (228)
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out .  (229)
i don &apos;t know why it &apos;s wonderful to do that .  (230)
i was feeling great .  (231)
i don &apos;t know why i had never been found  (232)
i mean , this thing to do so .  (233)

shame , grief , loss : these are 普林斯 , to wisdom .  (281)
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman has made our pain . we all emotions than , let &apos;s interested in a genius , can have more profound and lethal . &quot;  (282)
he was telling us to find cruel woman ?  (283)
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s .  (284)
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ?  (285)
other emotional would allow us to see their own hostility ugly intentions heart and what they deserve ?  (286)
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ?  (287)
freud shortly after that says that .  (288)
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud would think that he and his wife disobedience 憔悴 ours so .  (289)
freud think this guy kind of weird because he doesn &apos;t really concerned with his wife do .  (290)
because his wife was innocent , you know .  (291)
this poor guys just 缘由 , no doubt .  (292)
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move .  (293)
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ?  (294)
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard .  (295)
fiction writing about this very well .  (296)
it &apos;s able to describe this novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right .  (297)
well , our envy more intense , we will be more often .  (298)
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something illegal or violence .  (299)
envy causes us to become very extreme .  (300)
i admit , i think there &apos;s an eight year-old themselves , but i also on the news came to see a story .  (301)
一个52岁 michigan women were discovered register a facebook account fake and used to account for their malicious sent a year .  (302)
a year . for one year .  (303)
she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before the aisles girlfriend now , i must admit , when i heard it when i was in response she admired  (304)
because , i want to say that , you face reality .  (305)
ah , just how creative in the wrong place , isn &apos;t it ?  (306)
this comes from fiction .  (307)
a 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel .  (308)
海史密斯 is my favorite writers and  (309)
she &apos;s on the extraordinary 文学史 诡 curiosity and a  (310)
for example , tom , but in her case , the most famous .  (311)
里普利 started to you or want what you have , then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in a basement 应答 his name , and you wear your ring spend your bank account .  (312)
this is a road .  (313)
but we do ? we cannot 里普利 over .  (314)
i couldn &apos;t give a huge change the world , even though i would one day be able to do this .  (315)
and unfortunately , because we live in admire .  (316)
we live in envy .  (317)
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , isn &apos;t it ?  (318)
it can give us a novel solution ? i &apos;m not sure .  (319)
let &apos;s 学学 fictional characters , to see them on the right thing to meet puzzles and don &apos;t know how they do .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to the b 贝克街 221 夏洛克 ask 福尔摩斯 leonardo  (321)
when people think about his 福尔摩斯 would opponent 里亚蒂 professor -- this crime genius  (322)
but i &apos;ve always liked to 探雷 epidemic 斯垂德 阴险 a face scottish 头子 . he was very 福尔摩斯 need to his intelligence , but hate him .  (323)
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this .  (324)
he &apos;s 雷斯 垂 to help , and to hate him in the case of mysterious 侦破 苦闷 again , always story  (325)
we proud of you . &quot;  (326)
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold your hand 福尔摩斯  (327)
this is 少数几次 福尔摩斯 we see in the way , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it &apos;s like having as a geometry , instead of emotions .  (329)
this minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand in the same .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he had hate .  (332)
but what &apos;s so simple ?  (333)
if envy is really a geometric to do , a question of how we choose your relationship with other questions ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate somebody talent .  (335)
we &apos;ll chase .  (336)
but i love contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
it has been going on with envy fiction  (339)
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it please .  (340)
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy , millions , there &apos;s 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there .  (341)

ar de 内格尔 : i found in new york in the trash .  (344)
i was 10 or so , once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a place in the new york in the wild .  (345)
it was really good weather .  (346)
the forest searched twinkling lights .  (347)
shine sunlight , the leaves and 晶莹 like when from the stained glass feet . if you don &apos;t have a way , we have to pretend that we &apos;re at this piece of the first human .  (348)
we eventually got to our camp .  (349)
that &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
and in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing .  (352)
people to camp was too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would 善后 clean for them ?  (353)
the problem has been baffling to me , became a longer sound bite .  (354)
who &apos;s going to clean up we leave the garbage ?  (355)
but you can take this problem on anything you live in a place . 伊斯坦 clean we leave the garbage ?  (356)
in rio cleaned we leave the garbage ? in paris and london ?  (357)
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector cleaned up to 11 , we leave 000吨 trash and 2000吨 &apos;s recycling waste every day .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know who &apos;s doing this work .  (360)
in the sanitation trucks were parked on this in a sense of responsibility for what ?  (361)
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project .  (362)
i was sitting in the car , along the lines on the new york at the office , all the sanitation trucks were parked people live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now i &apos;m not 垃圾车 sitting in , and i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 .  (366)
my own manipulate the electric 扫帚 scanners 铲 street , in the snow .  (367)
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process .  (368)
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell .  (369)
there is smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad , but very soon , you will adapt .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even a few years of working side worker , their bodies have adapted to try and weekly megatons of garbage .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
with the labor 统计局 report , the sanitation trucks were parked work is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then you figure out why .  (374)
you all day on the road , which are of traffic .  (375)
out of the car just trying to drive more than you , people are not careful .  (376)
the sanitation trucks were parked workers , it was terrible .  (377)
and that &apos;s full of the junk that often poisons 毒物 垃圾车 from comes out , in a terrible harm .  (378)
i also learned the brutal and frightening .  (379)
when you &apos;re walking down the sanitation trucks were parked car 路沿 , in a city , you &apos;ll see you realize that the really like the power of nature itself .  (380)
it never is 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like a breathing loop or form .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important workforce . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient every day , and the waste from containers sort of , it will actually poison in a very real way threats to our lives .  (387)
we attacked several 和数 century after decade out to the disease , and to threaten our health .  (388)
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , and we can &apos;t space with new things . that &apos;s it , economic engine would 停歇 , because people consumption down .  (390)
i &apos;m not suggesting that capitalism , i &apos;m here is just that their relationship .  (391)
and the third reason -- is what i call our average and necessary , 经常性 activity speed .  (392)
i mean , in the days , and today , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know that we have a team to work on these things were sitting over there is densest .  (395)
so today i want you to think that the sanitation trucks were parked situation , maybe help . they &apos;re called them please come to talk about how to build a sustainable people , the city .  (396)
i think their work is a noble .  (397)
and every time they really very to work in the street .  (398)
in many cities , they &apos;re wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work .  (399)
you know , they would be to clean up garbage on time .  (400)
they allow us to secure in their work .  (401)
they almost became secure work promise .  (402)
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and waste . anyway , all this work is going to keep stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the next day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and pull , i was young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 week doing .  (404)
i want to thank him to do this job in that particular days , but i just cry up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , and again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name was 保利 times , we have been working together , you become friends .  (409)
i want to believe that 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we as part of this planet , we need to work very hard to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
the city , that we know of garbage actually the amount of waste is only three percent .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the trash , please find a time 致意 to them .  (415)
find a time to say thank you .  (416)
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory .  (417)

please 一下门 attention color and materials .  (420)
now , imagine a naked people on the overweight .  (421)
going on a naked cycling to your front door , and it heads .  (422)
to try to imagine 近在眼前 alive .  (423)

and then 径直 hit in your front door .  (425)
四下 bicycle wheel fly go flying off from your next rolling a spoke into that corner of embarrassing .  (426)
the threshold into 门厅 in the hallway and other parts of the soft comfort .  (427)
the light on the sweet pastry monster .  (428)
he was sitting in this horse 马背 骏马 brown on the positive 招手 you .  (429)
and the 马会 speak .  (430)
you can feel his nose 发痒 鬃毛 blue for you .  (431)
you can smell , he was thrown in your mouth 曲奇 granola grapes .  (432)
around him around , he walked into the living room  (433)
standing in the living room put your imagination to imagine the largest tuned in 小甜甜 britney  (434)
her wear exposed to your coffee table , dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot;  (435)
and with i walked in your kitchen .  (436)
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 to drill out your oven , you go to the track is &quot; 绿野 仙 in 铁皮 dorothy 稻草人 people walking arm in arm with lions 蹦蹦跳跳 on their hands , came to you .  (437)
okay , open your eyes .  (438)
i &apos;m going to tell you a annual spring in new york are going to have the unexpected .  (439)
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory .  (440)
a few years ago i 科技类 as a journalist to the competition with this thought about there to be like geeks who &quot; super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of 屈指可数 men and women and girls from the old some don &apos;t notice personal health  (442)
just look at some 奋力 in a situation hundreds of any to remember the numbers .  (443)
some populations in trying to remember the names of the strangers  (444)
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem .  (445)
and in the game , who is the fastest way laying down 一整副 打乱 card order .  (446)
and i thought that &apos;s amazing .  (447)
these people surely 禀 other talents  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training .  (450)
i asked him , &quot; ed you when you start to realize that they &apos;re memory genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; i don &apos;t mean anything .  (452)
and my memory was .  (453)
the game to every single person will tell you their memory is just generally .  (454)
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall 过人 smart amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio on how britney 一整副 remember 打乱 card order .  (459)
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me !  (461)
we had to find a man , why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very peculiar journey unfold in front of me 序幕 .  (463)
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and research on the memory , i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again and other hidden remember exactly what the potential .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called e. p .  (466)
he suffers amnesia his memory was probably the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia is very surprising .  (468)
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can learn memory in any way , shape our personality .  (469)
this is another extreme i met this one .  (470)
his name is kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; characters in .  (472)
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library back and i think is just fascinating phone books .  (473)
and i went back home and i read a lot in papers write about memory 两千多年 ago in latin wrote papers from ancient until then , during the medieval  (474)
and i learned a lot of interesting things .  (475)
one is used to train illegal beam nurturing memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people want to send their memory 不遗余力 can in their hearts .  (477)
these technologies for modern life possible , but also changed our  (478)
not just in the culture , and i think in cognitive .  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to remember that sometimes we already forgot how to memory .  (480)
in this place on earth are very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam culture that memory of an extraordinary memory .  (481)
it &apos;s not that extraordinary to do this all over the world .  (482)
i was fascinated with that these people want to know how to do it .  (483)
a few years ago london school of a university researchers asked to a contest to study memory .  (484)
they want to figure out what those people tell us whether somebody else &apos;s brain in anatomically structure different ?  (485)
the answer is no  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the challenges of our brain . there &apos;s a really interesting is that the different .  (489)
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory digital or 人脸 or kind of memory , researchers found that there are challenges activated brain region is not with people .  (490)
notice that they think , is in the brain in space memory and navigation will , in part .  (491)
why ? what can we figure out what kind of thing ?  (492)
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward 白热化 . every year , someone with more effective memory show 赛场 and other ways to catch up .  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there .  (494)
in his 台前 三十六副 打乱 sequence a card for an hour , he would get all the use of his own invented it , he would have the skills .  (495)
and it &apos;s in the same way that he had a word , not bad back off binary numbers 4140个 any folding only half an hour .  (496)
a cow .  (497)
in the competition of 参赛者 using a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all the skills to finally have into a conceptual psychologists call a delicate code . &quot;  (498)
this idea to humor with a paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox of simple is that i had two people to remember one word to you and i said , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
that &apos;s a baker .  (500)
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot;  (501)
after a while back and i find you ask , &quot; remember what i call you remember before the word ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what word ? &quot;  (503)
they were told 人名 baker &apos;s people remember that term potential away , not as being told a baker that person .  (504)
the same word cause different memories .  (505)
what is , why ?  (506)
because without any particular 人名 baker .  (507)
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any .  (508)
but baker used it as a noun that we all know what &apos;s baker  (509)
baker with funny white cap .  (510)
they hand and ourselves .  (511)
they came home from work with a toast 扑鼻 .  (512)
maybe some people have friends are baker  (513)
we first hear this word , immediately produce all kinds of ways that allow us to after a while , can still remember .  (514)
this precise memory skills 两千五百年 in front of the ancient greeks have .  (515)
and call it through .  (516)
developed this technique of this process is a simonides called the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he was being asked to do , because in the performing guest in the fancy party cool standard , not just d. j. to beat reduction , but to please poet ode to .  (518)
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died .  (519)
not all death all of them were come down on 面目全非 to  (520)
nobody says that you have to have some of the people who don &apos;t like to tell who &apos;s sitting  (521)
that causes the body can &apos;t get 殉葬 place .  (522)
and then this reinforce the whole thing tragedy colors .  (523)
simonides standing outside of as being close your eyes , only survivors thrust upon realizing in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 are sitting .  (524)
he was hold the hand of the relative to the site and they brought up to us .  (525)
simonides 醒悟 thrust upon the things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we can &apos;t name the phone to remember every word or colleagues command , we all have very keen visual or space memory .  (526)
if i ask you to recap 逐字逐句 i showed you before simonides story about 10 words should not many people will remember .  (527)
but i bet you now , if i put down your back in the foyer . sat will speak 骏马 brown on who you understand what i mean .  (528)
this advice from the latin 两千多年 ago , the first memory .  (529)
so this phrase principles , what is this ?  (530)
suppose you were invited to stand in the center of the ted stage , and you want to talk 脱稿 西塞罗 like in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the general 霸气 that he would go one , and you want .  (531)
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their  (532)
and imagine working with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster mr. ed sitting on the back .  (534)
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends cook ed  (535)
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney you would like to talk about britney of that little story .  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topics are you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association  (537)
this is presenting rome home reciting 稿 secret , which is not just a word bad would just text reciting 添麻烦 flat , but remember , one by one .  (538)
that phrase : &quot; the theme &quot; comes from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is 古时候 people to talk about rhetorical , or in the space .  (540)
&quot; the phrase &quot; means your memories palace 第一层 .  (541)
it &apos;s too much fun for me it up a lot of interest .  (542)
and then i went to more memory .  (543)
i started to more detailed 萌发 . it &apos;s about the memory of culture .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory process is very boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there .  (547)
very exciting moment is not a small source 揉 somebody 揉 .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing !  (549)
i know that these people in the brain is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see 外人 as  (550)
and i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit at the morning new york times before 十五 spend 20 minutes to try something .  (552)
put it back .  (553)
back in 跳蚤市场 back , i bought 年鉴 people in the old .  (554)
i was surprised to find it very 带劲  (555)
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise  (556)
it &apos;s goal is not to train memory .  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better creative imagination in your mind working to create the myth is completely funny 胡乱 your memorable .  (558)
and it became my joy .  (559)
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a 耳塞 镜面 all 护目镜 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory is the biggest enemies attention distributed  (561)
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 .  (562)
i also want to signed up for impulse is just as in sexual news experiment .  (563)
and i thought to be in the when 前言 调侃 about himself .  (564)
the problem is experiment finally got unexpected consequences  (565)
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
back to me now talk or shopping 稿 phone number one is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important .  (567)
these are little usual tricks  (568)
the usual tricks memory works is because the human brain 依仗 them some basic principles .  (569)
don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember 几副 the order of the cards and you can actually from understanding brains have some benefits of principle .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 it is not .  (571)
powerful memory is can acquire .  (572)
from the fundamental 专心致志 can keep talking about .  (573)
engaged , can remember  (574)
memory palace , or that memory skills are just 捷径 .  (575)
they &apos;re actually really 捷径 deemed  (576)
this work is because forces you to think about it .  (577)
it forces you to go deeper to make you more focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to the training  (578)
actually 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist .  (579)
this is that we have to remember things .  (580)
by having experiences that i found that our bodies 潜藏 with amazing memory .  (581)
but if you want to live unforgettable is to do a lot of people to remember that .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
who 沃斯 duke pulling lee : success ? willpower .  (584)
on my 27th , and i left a very challenging companies -- to professional management , turn it into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i came to some new york city public schools to teach seven grade math .  (586)
and as other teachers , i &apos;ll give students do little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
when these 试卷 assignment and open up , and then i calculate their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq , the ups are not my best and the worst students , the only difference between .  (590)
some of the great 课业 in that students don &apos;t have a very high iq points .  (591)
some very smart kids will 课业 in the present less 尽如人意 .  (592)
this got me thinking .  (593)
and of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like rates , small number , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation .  (594)
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , as long as they would spend time and effort .  (595)
after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in education , we need to start learning dynamic perspective and psychological level , the students and learning . take a more profound understanding .  (596)
in education systems , we all know the great evaluating students standards iq is , but if you &apos;re in schools and the good life do than just rely on highly capable of learning for you ?  (597)
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids and adults are , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and the instruments , work , my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they succeeding ?  (599)
i and my research group 西点 point to do research .  (600)
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out .  (601)
we see the first to build a word , but also try to anticipate what kids can level-up in the end game .  (602)
we study in hostile environment for work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students .  (603)
we work with 私企 , they sell to ask what people can stay in .  (604)
what can the more money ?  (605)
in all these different context , a character that no one out , which was largely predicted success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
it &apos;s not nice appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on .  (610)
tenacity is a sustainable 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is you for the future , every day on , is not just for a week or a month , but a few decades trying to struggle for their dream and reality .  (612)
tenacity is put life as a marathon . it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower .  (614)
i &apos;m 千名 on 初中生 conducted a survey , and about willpower waiting for more than a year , and you can look at what graduate students .  (615)
all is not the point , or 西点 in the competition to build the words that willpower . this is also in school , especially for those dropout 徘徊 on the edge of the kids .  (616)
for my own self , about tenacity me the most astonishing thing is heading for willpower . we cognitive , creating tenacity , the scientific understanding that was how poor .  (617)
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ?  (619)
and how to mobilize their long-term is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know , talented doesn &apos;t make you gritty heart .  (622)
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , what we see this data , tenacity usually has nothing to do with other factors , even with the brilliance scale run counter .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard about children on developing tough qualities called &quot; the most effective exponential growth mindset . &quot;  (625)
stanford 卡洛杜 william , with a view , and he believed that the human learning can change , it as you try to measure the change .  (626)
杜威克 professor means , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain and its facing challenges , what was happening and grew up , what they fail , more prone to keep going , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure .  (627)
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
and so i decided to close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
this is what in front of a job .  (631)
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice .  (632)
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in back again .  (633)
in other words , we just have to become more tenacity to allow our children to become more willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
steve titus 泽维尔 dimensions and into : local culture .  (636)
as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , will also think about , building around with the environment , buildings , and with their environment , which is the relationship between the tradition .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples based on this idea .  (638)
there are two examples in the emerging countries , one in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
one of these cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different ways to make the building analysis , design solutions important components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping malls .  (641)
this is my team and i was the same for example , we were asked to design into this way .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
look at the same in this kind of buildings -- the city and a lot of this kind of building -- we found that the most important three questions .  (644)
first , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , people who are not big brands .  (645)
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because the roads are built outside of glass , this design would be trapped inside heat in architecture , it causes we need a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this city climate is quite 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 左右. 25度 .  (647)
the third problem is the building looks like one african or ethiopia didn &apos;t matter .  (648)
for a 底蕴 culture and abundance city , it &apos;s called us down .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was so fascinated 集贸市场 local deeply . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the built environment , in the hands of 小商贩 from to buy products .  (650)
this is consistent with my ideas , is in outdoor public setting the idea of creating activities .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 this idea of building ?  (653)
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapidly growing city in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building on the before and after two years ago , in parallel streets 几百米 have little can connected .  (655)
so we need to do is use the buildings that we have portal , all the way to connect these two together .  (656)
and then we have a gradient 庭 of design , created an open architecture space , and this design by its shape to avoid the pedestrian 日晒雨淋 by .  (657)
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same .  (658)
i think , the question is , the buildings outside walls are decorated ?  (659)
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment .  (660)
and i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way , and the light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we went from ethiopia women beautiful pattern in traditional dress got inspiration .  (662)
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls .  (663)
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and control in the way we light into the building .  (664)
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night .  (665)
but we start with these ideas don &apos;t touch the building , and their response , sort of , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all know , the design solutions to than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more shop number .  (667)
and this outside walls design , reduced lots and lots of cost , not just because of this 预制 material cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of the air conditioning to control .  (668)
and we ultimately save part of the budget .  (669)
where is the first question is , think about how to make sure that the building in power , because we live in cities , almost every day 闸 pull . electricity .  (670)
so we were on the roof of solar panels .  (671)
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , and here , in a city oasis 小憩 for people .  (672)
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the building clean .  (673)
we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , well .  (674)
the second example for the tunisian town planning a 2000套 than collateral infrastructure and an apartment building .  (675)
do scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i &apos;m not very deep need to understand the city and tunisia , to understand associated with her of tradition and culture .  (676)
in the process of doing my attention is a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is the structure of history has a brick wall , over thousands of years , there are 12 structure through the door , 相互之间 is almost straight to the road .  (677)
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 primary small areas in size and all the characteristics , similar to what we in barcelona and other european cities common blocks planning .  (678)
in these blocks planning basis , referenced mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , shifted the beginning model .  (679)
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , these kind of a cubicle , is this huge planning basic components .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is the best towards ?  (681)
the answer is 南北朝 to , you can use 南北 house on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we do this kind of model for all the apartments , have the perfect towards .  (683)
this is the effect , as we design a city with the european style , with a combination of residential style .  (684)
some of the building areas with garden , and walk around on the ground and sidewalks to connect .  (685)
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 population density of the population density high , not very expensive .  (686)
and she &apos;s right up to our entry 通性 connected to each other .  (687)
this is the project i &apos;d 得意 part , it &apos;s like to be these buildings takes up space to gave community .  (688)
the community can climb roofs and poke somebody talk to each other , god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or in the back and forth between jump .  (689)
these two in some cases , in the design process with the same way .  (690)
again , they were in the city , you can literally see 拔地而起 little buildings .  (691)
in these cities , architecture for people on it , present and future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate .  (692)
for this reason , i think about architecture in terms of design , the more important , is how , searching for simple solutions , and very cheap enough to enhance and promote the local people and civic relationship , and to make people good close to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . at first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , and people said that the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche .  (697)
i think there are three things like this .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus .  (699)
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task .  (701)
i think people to this proposition , purpose and things that are wrong .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , purpose and in a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is : why people believe that in the lower 信任感 ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing .  (706)
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls polls , to find out about 信任感 in decline .  (708)
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this idea .  (709)
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and mainly politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and 20 years ago is highly trust people like the and nurse , still get altitude of trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in society 居中 these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
poll records , of course , is that some people .  (714)
or poll can record ?  (715)
but it &apos;s a general attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;re talking about .  (716)
you trust their politicians ? trust ?  (717)
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
you trust sell fish ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart you ask .  (722)
when you understand what &apos;s the problem , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot;  (723)
a very rational answer .  (724)
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways for trust .  (725)
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the civil servant , official people , and it will be types .  (726)
for example , i would say , i certainly believe in an elementary school , i know how to read a teacher will teach students , but i don &apos;t believe that she can run bus .  (727)
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers .  (728)
i might believe me , that love drinking to a friend &apos;s friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , he &apos;s a secret .  (729)
that &apos;s it .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 said , well , we all do polls 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ?  (731)
i think poll is a very bad 信任感 measure whether there &apos;s an idea , because it 抹杀 people to think , well , poor judgment 信任感 poor judgment .  (732)
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ?  (733)
it was , we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think this is pretty funny .  (735)
i think this is not the purpose .  (736)
i would say , they deserve to be trusted more to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people .  (737)
in fact , i said it was trying not to trust not trusted people .  (738)
for example , who put their save something that looks like it &apos;s like they were money to roll out 麦道 夫 sir , i think people who say that ? yeah , yeah , so easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
wise to trust and wise choose not to trust that &apos;s the purpose .  (741)
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important not to trust , but reputation of ?  (742)
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy .  (743)
i think , to make decisions about three right to consider .  (744)
to see if they do ? honest allows you to do ? good ?  (745)
if we think that one allows you to be , in his field allows you to be honest . and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe they , because they &apos;re reliable .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not with them to help me to send messages , because they &apos;re forget .  (748)
i was very confident some friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident .  (749)
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to be reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest .  (750)
perhaps there , i haven &apos;t discovered .  (751)
we need is before : trust to look at his reputation reliability .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do .  (754)
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the institution , there is a professional level or official demand on these making it easier for us to determine whether there was a reputation .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that .  (757)
i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 接生 than a child &apos;s hard . &quot;  (758)
in our public life , our institutions lives , we find a lot of questions . the institution and accountability for the rules to protect his reputation can &apos;t be trusted as an idea of rules to see it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
it allows people to focus their work , like 助产士 them , and they take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually had that experience .  (761)
on purpose to talk about a lot .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgments , a quick reaction , are attitude , not all of you here .  (763)
and thirdly , about the task .  (764)
the task called rebuild 信任感 . this is another out against .  (765)
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust .  (766)
well , we can do for ourselves .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but off the what , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from each other .  (770)
you can &apos;t fix people say to you .  (771)
you need to do with trying to make people 家信 let you .  (772)
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people .  (773)
and of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful around , let them know that you are trustworthy .  (775)
how to do that ?  (776)
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work ?  (777)
i give you just a simple business home marketing examples .  (778)
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions .  (779)
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 , or give me change color is my favorite socks .  (780)
it &apos;s good . i trust them , because they make me think they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
for others , if you make myself in vulnerable , this is a good trustworthy an idea . say to yourself , you have confidence .  (783)
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell .  (784)
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
科林 de 托克斯 : the film manhood .  (787)
as the father made me happy , is that you want to see the movie .  (788)
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , and together we saw the 仙 绿野 spaces . &quot;  (789)
the next few months , she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 .  (791)
and she put themselves dressed as like 仙女 was holding 魔杖 .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll find this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , raise kids , are getting immersed in a child a fantastic complex world .  (794)
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot;  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
that trend is 40 years later today was popular . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 毛绒绒 and a guy who that enemy to mimic the safeguard to save a girl .  (797)
you know that this is what movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
well , this film , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of different 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; we see with all the film in recent years 两三 ways , there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients .  (801)
they even more violence in there , for instance , like this .  (802)
but i think if we today 绿野 film 仙 tracking , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of people .  (803)
use your magic slippers 巫婆 bad to beat the army . &quot;  (804)
but it &apos;s not like that .  (805)
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; special . it &apos;s shown in the most heroic role , intelligence , even bad people are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; together , realizing that point , there was a little different things .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
it was three .  (809)
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him to see .  (810)
but as a second child at home , for his care suddenly sort of a lot .  (811)
and he also run in , and then the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck are born with the duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this film . but he clearly i became obsessed with this .  (812)
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons .  (813)
it &apos;s video theme of courage , tenacity and faithful ?  (814)
also 卢克 or joins the army facts about overthrowing a government ?  (815)
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is how to win ?  (817)
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders .  (818)
and i hope to their children in this environment -- oz world -- up , not to beat up to the world -- this was a very very close to reality .  (819)
why do we show kids movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ?  (820)
for women &apos;s film about men &apos;s violence impact , a lot of good analysis , you should look at articles written . good .  (821)
the atmosphere for boys impact , i read the article not that much .  (822)
and my own experience , 从莱娅 , what about the environment guide me not getting experience in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; the &quot; 混居 men and women .  (823)
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen at the end of the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i do a mission , winning 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be standing here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 .  (829)
of course , as an example of , and i would in front of you for disney princess they defend .  (830)
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not these films expected audience .  (831)
these films had great all because this is how we teach girls against 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society .  (832)
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 .  (833)
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , including 赫敏 like 特里斯 and kevin and mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i tell you all recommend this film . now are being shown in .  (836)
you remember the brave lore &quot; criticism , the first project ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 also beginning to do the movies . &quot;  (838)
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , almost all of these films , not by &quot; 贝克德 test . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
this test for people who don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do about them .  (842)
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her , and a friend in and they saw the movie about content .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)
think about the standard .  (845)
if , female characters in movies , to do that ?  (846)
if you talk to them , have in common 心上人 talking about it ?  (847)
okay ? thank you .  (848)
thank you very much .  (849)
two women , to have to speak , there .  (850)
there was this film . i saw , but we &apos;ve seen in and enjoy movies is very rare .  (851)
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen quality of a nice movie 阿尔戈 . &quot;  (852)
oscar the movie , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality .  (853)
but bell doerr test f .  (854)
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film , most of what &apos;s happening in plot 人质 has been hijacked events in big 使馆 , men and women are hidden inside .  (855)
we see several scenarios , men are profound and be in conversation with anxiety , and a woman in the movie actor , the nice story is the next door , and said , &quot; you sleep , honey ? &quot;  (856)
this is hollywood .  (857)
look at statistics .  (858)
2011 100部 before the most popular movies , how many film a heroine ?  (859)
11部 . not too bad .  (860)
just picked universal congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , this is a good ratio .  (861)
so this ratio , higher than that , and the percentage of you will get shock .  (862)

he lived in somalia in a small village  (893)
this is from the capital 加迪休 &apos;s village .  (894)
this little village , because it &apos;s been so poor drought 食不果腹 people .  (895)

he had the opportunity , no , no , no prospects .  (897)
and only lived in a tent 加迪休 &apos;s town in the country .  (898)

one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat my breakfast and lunch and dinner .  (900)
he &apos;s alive with a bunch of people , and he got rest .  (901)
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes , can give their own native to send money .  (902)
they give him introduced a young girl .  (903)
and they did .  (904)
he started new life .  (905)
he &apos;s life .  (906)
one day in 加迪休 &apos;s 碧蓝 in the sky there was a car bombing .  (907)
this is the city of my little boy is the suicide bombers , and when that help dynamic people are &quot; for youth &quot; and a party and al qaeda terrorist organization relationships .  (908)
this little boy just wanted to go through the city through the story of why he &apos;s a suicide attack for the end ?  (909)
he actually wait .  (910)
he was a chance to wait for the future of his waiting for a can move road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road .  (911)
this is going to be like him from 成年期 waiting for the first encounter .  (912)
and he was in the same story with different center in the world .  (913)
this is a story about power , taken from the story of urban youth unemployment . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out of things .  (914)
for young people , cities with dreams , which means 大城市 to job opportunities , wealth , but not to enjoy their young people in the city .  (915)
more , are young people stand in the unemployment .  (916)
by 2030 , five people living in cities , which has three is a under 18 people .  (917)
if we in urban development , not to think about amazing people , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities for you come across this story 成年期 terrorism and violence and gang 雷池 these will be the future of cities .  (918)
i was born in the city , who &apos;s unemployed in 加迪休 70 percent .  (919)
no , no book 70 percent .  (920)
basically do nothing  (921)
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital .  (922)
i remember standing that are full of play in front of an eye hospital , i think if i don &apos;t leave it would be ?  (923)
if i get to in the same 成年期 waiting for ?  (924)
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ?  (925)
and i did say no .  (926)
last month , i went back 加迪休 &apos;s why it is to try an obsession with business leadership learn summit  (927)
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership  (928)
we sat down and working together solutions to cities are the biggest problem .  (929)
one in the room called aden young people .  (930)
he &apos;s in 加迪休 on a university and graduated .  (931)
there was no job , nothing .  (932)
and i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , frustration party is &quot; for youth &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit .  (933)
the people that look like this .  (934)
but his story , it &apos;s another version  (935)
in 加迪休 &apos;s from a to b , and the biggest obstacle was the  (936)
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and it actually , it became the easy-to-use tools .  (937)
aden find opportunities and grab it on .  (938)
he built a motorcycle company .  (939)
started a cab motorcycle to the people who buy motorbikes .  (940)
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years 数百辆 spread  (941)
he &apos;s the story of how different ?  (942)
what makes the difference ?  (943)
i believe is his find opportunities to grasp and opportunity .  (944)
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is about 成年期 waiting for the most effective tool .  (945)
he drove young people as they had been crazy searching for economic opportunity makers  (946)
you can put people into the training .  (947)
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a meeting mohamoud doctor-heroes his name is a 名花 business .  (948)
he was trained in business to help me on the summit of nurturing their creative people how to create entrepreneurship .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; you see what &apos;s the flowers for a lot of time ? &quot; born in civil wars , who was their answer would be , &quot; never seen . &quot;  (950)
so from the opportunities that doctor-heroes  (951)
he created an 园林 and greening with the design company .  (952)
he &apos;s in 加迪休 go out on a agriculture , and he started to grow tulip 百合花 and as he said that can take a bad climate 加迪休 &apos;s .  (953)
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s busy building 22年 加迪休 &apos;s the first park to citizens .  (954)
now there &apos;s no citizens 加迪休 &apos;s in park .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for family young people together , to be here as he said , to feel and inspire 花香 rose .  (956)
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep .  (958)
they don &apos;t want to business .  (959)
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he innovation for those people very big .  (960)
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city .  (961)
he makes them that they can also be entrepreneurs can also be changing the world .  (962)
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now .  (963)
they came up with a business solution to local problems .  (964)
so young companies to create a culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business  (966)
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , they need to shift from idea to create you equivalent to create a catalyst for cities  (967)
for me , entrepreneurship was not on business  (968)
it involves creating social impact .  (969)
not sells flowers on doctor-heroes  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , and will truly change people to the city .  (972)
side street aden hired to help him a cab to help him and maintain the motorcycle  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to escape from was to get 成年期 wait .  (974)
these young entrepreneurs , all of them have a profound impact cities .  (975)
so my suggestion is that move more young people become entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more flowers and peace park story there rather than the car bomb and 成年期 waiting for the story .  (976)
thank you .  (977)
薛晓岚 : easy to learn how to read the chinese word for .  (978)
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , and one of the most precious memory is a mother and i showed the chinese word for the beauty of form of care .  (979)

&quot; day . &quot;  (999)
&quot; months . &quot;  (1000)
&quot; 門 &quot; sign like wild about comfort pair of cars on the door .  (1001)
i call this eight words for basic words .  (1002)
it &apos;s a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words .  (1003)
the &quot; man . &quot;  (1004)
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot;  (1005)
a phrase from people , two , three people for the public .  (1006)
if somebody open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot;  (1007)
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; in , that people had been stuck .  (1008)
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about get stuck in the whale belly .  (1009)
tree is &quot; carpenter . &quot; &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot;  (1010)
three trees together , is &quot; forests . &quot;  (1011)
take a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot;  (1012)
to put a 张嘴 on a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot;  (1013)
remember to very easy , because a tree , it &apos;s going to speak 呆傻 things .  (1014)
remember &quot; fire &quot; ?  (1015)
两团 &quot; fire &quot; together , it becomes very hot , &quot; &quot; .  (1016)
三团 &quot; fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much .  (1017)
it &apos;s two trees in the next , will &quot; burn . &quot;  (1018)
for us , the sun is all sources of life .  (1019)
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around .  (1020)
the three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot;  (1021)
when the sun and the moon these together , and it &apos;s called the light . &quot;  (1022)
one day after a night , which is &quot; tomorrow . &quot;  (1023)
the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; 旦 . &quot;  (1024)
a &quot; door . &quot; and put the block of wood , which is &quot; 门闩 . &quot;  (1025)
to put a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot;  (1026)
&quot; bang ! &quot; , people in the home ?  (1027)
this is even outside , &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; avoid . &quot;  (1028)
the left , we have a woman .  (1029)
two women together , maybe have debate .  (1030)

these are the words in school later , we started learning how to build a phrase .  (1036)
for example , the &quot; hill &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcanoes . &quot; this is &quot; volcanoes . &quot;  (1037)
we know that japan is the sun rises place .  (1038)
and here the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china .  (1039)
so the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot;  (1040)
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; man , we get what ?  (1041)
&quot; the japanese . &quot;  (1042)
the word mountains , and there are those two together .  (1043)
in the ancient chinese 流亡 , which means , because china clothes 政敌 put in to the mountain .  (1044)
nowadays , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go out . &quot;  (1045)
one of the word &quot; tells you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot;  (1046)
