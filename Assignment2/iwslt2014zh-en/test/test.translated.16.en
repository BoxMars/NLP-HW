meg jay : why was 20 , 30 is not new . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need mental therapy patient . 
and i was a clinical psychologist in berkeley university read the ph . 3d students . 
she &apos;s a called alex 26 women . 
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off the shoes , and she said to me , she was told me to the men . 
when i heard this , and i disengaged . 
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk to my boys . 
i think i can deal with this thing . 
but i can &apos;t do that . 
alex in every meeting , all that funny story , so to me 点点 head , and on the results of the time is a very , very easy thing . 
alex would say , &quot; this is the new , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later to have to have children , after all , even after death is to have . 
and i like alex 二十几岁 like people , except for the time , nothing . 
but not too long , i have 催 that i started to push alex love life . 
i refuse . 
i said , &quot; yes , she &apos;s now on a date , and she &apos;s the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time is in the best before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment . 
and in that moment , i learned 30 is not new 二十岁 . 
yes , people than ever before later 安顿 off , but that doesn &apos;t mean that alex 二十几岁 between , this is her 低谷 development . 
it makes 二十几岁 alex the development of a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there spoil it . 
and i realized that this &quot; kindness oversight , &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for love , alex and her life 二十几岁 around for people with the family . 
now , the united states have about 5千万 二十几岁 people . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can experience 二十几岁 stage in this case , after adults period . 
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand . 
i really wanted to see here , 一些二十几岁 people . 
that &apos;s great ! you &apos;re awesome . 
and if you 二十几岁 people work , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you 二十几岁 because people lost and o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome 二十几岁 , people are very important . 
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime that 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old . 
that means that every 10 to your life would be the kind of experience with that . &quot; ! &quot; moment of eight happened in 30 中旬 . 
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money , you will make a very big impact . 
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 before and 终生 同居 married , mate , or on a date . 
we know in your brain 二十几岁 adults , to adapt to the second issue is the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own , what is now change its time . 
we know other than life 二十岁 stage personality , the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , to the summit to 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do . 
so you 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body in the future , and the choice of the time . 
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago and admiration brain development language is the critical period . 
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact of time . 
but we hear a few there &apos;s a thing called adults development , and our 二十岁 this stage is adult development of the critical period . 
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard . 
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change . 
researchers have 二十几岁 called extend adolescence . 
journalist 二十几岁 for people to stupid , like , &quot; the names , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , and we get is actually the most important decades 期中 adults a doesn &apos;t matter . 
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time . 
this is not right ? 
so , when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ? 
nothing happens . 
you take that guy urgency , and worked , but nothing happening . 
and everybody says , &quot; just in 30 before i started my career , that no problem . &quot; this one . 
but then they start : &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have to . 
i graduated that the best 写写 my résumé . &quot; 
and they start : &quot; 二十几岁 date , like a seat in games . 
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but music is about 30 to stop off a for a start , you sit down . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i married my husband and i think the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently &quot; chair &quot; . &quot; 
二十几岁 here where people ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
well , that sounds that may seem a little bit 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , very high currency here . 
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and as research shows that started 三十几岁 on this stage and do so many things of stress level , and it &apos;s too big . 
in a thousand years later , middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy . 
is that our profession doesn &apos;t want to . 
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or can &apos;t give their kids a people . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people what to do best . 
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do . 
this is a story about a name &apos;s emma women story . 
25 emma , she came to my office with her , because , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art , or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent do at the . 
because cheap , she and her 脾气 show that worked more and more than my boyfriend live together . 
and no matter how difficult 二十几岁 her , she used lives more difficult . 
she &apos;s at a meeting , often cry , but said , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took one morning , fill her to people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this a word -- &quot; the blank behind . 
the last 歇斯底里 she looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot; 
now , i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i &apos;ll . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment . 
emma need a better life , and i know that this is her opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i would not let emma that has decided to work 10 years that flow off . 
so in the next weeks and a couple of months , i told the emma three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women , should all hear things . 
first of all , i tell emma forget her identity crisis and started to accumulate identity capital . 
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value . 
what you do a for what it was like to think of investment . 
i didn &apos;t know emma career , the future , and nobody knows the future of my own work , but i know that these : identity capital will do more to the identity of capital . 
this is take that one multinational career , that one in and you want to step up to the time . 
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to you can &apos;t called exploration . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of work and get them to count . 
secondly , i tell emma city tribes overestimate . 
the new capital , the new can almost always about out from the inside of the people at the community . 
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends . 
yes , about half the people who never 二十几岁 jobs , or not full employment . 
but it &apos;s not about half the connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group . 
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connect to your neighbor boss is you get that was not a 张贴 to work . 
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about how information out of science . 
and finally , emma people don &apos;t choose to believe that a family , but we can choose friends . 
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as soon emma 一个二十几岁 , who is going through and somebody 结伴 , create a family to take her family . 
i told emma choice family time is now . 
you might think , is a 20 , 30 than 25 , even better security , the next time , and i agreed . 
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your 同居 sleep , or people don &apos;t call progress . 
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which means love is treated as rich as work to do that . 
choice family is conscious choices you want to people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose the person you waste your time . 
and how that emma ? 
well , it turns out that we address thin , and she found her an old roommate , a family in another state an art museum work . 
the weak there to help her in a job . 
that job . give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons . 
now , the past five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and her a consciously chose people get married . 
she loved her new career , she in love with his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 behind a big enough to 的卡 . &quot; pieces . 
emma story to this thing sounds very simple , but this is my favorite 二十几岁 and the reason why people work . 
it &apos;s so easy to help them . 
people like 二十几岁 just leave los angeles international airport destination , somewhere in the west flights . 
take off , and the change is a little further in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s the difference . 
likewise , or even in 21 29岁 is 25 , a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 years , and even generations have a very big impact . 
here , give a worth spreading 二十几岁 to each of you know , the idea of people . 
it and i learned to say to alex as simple . 
don &apos;t be , you don &apos;t know , or didn &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re in determines your life . 
thank you . 
李镇河 李镇河 : &quot; true : into the world to you , &quot; infinite imagination 
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , we still have a real world and the gap between the virtual world . in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , is a touchscreen glass thin , so it &apos;s computers and all the people there . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the good ? 
so i started to try this crazy idea . 
i first build this tool , it can go digital space , if you take a pen that using force on the screen , and a pen pen and will go into a by pixels of the virtual world . 
designers directly in three-dimensional space to their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery . 
so , this is a tool that broke the virtual and real world of boundaries . 
but we are in the hands out . 
how can we reach into and digital information to interactions , and use our flexible hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space move into the work of numbers . 
because in reality window and file space is , pick exactly where they become like shelves from a book , and so easily . 
and you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands stretched or by various model . 
in this example that we &apos;re now entering the digital world . 
but how we can change the role of it to make digital information into our world ? 
in the room that many people have online shopping 退货 and experience . 
but , now than you don &apos;t worry about . 
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 online . 
this is the system , and our body geometry , through the characteristics of driving , or look at a way to show that we look at the time . 
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make our space these visible pixels into a touch can actually get , feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , the 雷米 , together , make it a &quot; matter a little pixels . &quot; 
in this case , this is like we 磁体 spherical shape in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer , this object and people will move into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place . 
it &apos;s the basic principles we stop for a ball , gravity . and it &apos;s magnetically levitated , mechanical sense , technology and drive on a ball together to control movement . 
and for this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , people can movement in the world of matter that can be recorded , back and forever , keep . 
so , it can be remote 编排 dance , and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 over and over again , if you can actually being repeated itself . 
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , is this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force . 
more exciting , it &apos;s not something that is to the computer into a real stuff , but to think , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity . 
and as you can see , digital information will not put things that give us , but we &apos;ll start acts to become part of our physical environment , not cut our connection with the real world . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can get the border , the rest is our enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
&apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned over two years in china 湖南 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years .

my dream is no longer going to do . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . their life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ah ! my god . 
i decided to dark for themselves , looking for another mission . 
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learn from the book . 
and the 三毛 全集 南怀瑾 &quot; and &quot; history experience . &quot; i in 1995 , to the united states in the united states , what i first read a book ? 
of course , is 禁书 china . 
the earth , &quot; talking about china farmers . 
real to be propaganda . okay . 
bible interesting , but it &apos;s odd . 
the topic 他日 and talk about . 
ten commandments , but in the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my mind a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; that &apos;s not and more than &quot; submission . &quot; 
it &apos;s become my 儒家 负罪感 up out of the tools i climb up , it becomes 儒家 负罪感 tools , and i rebuild the relationship with their parents . 
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from small to large use world map . 
i had never realized , it doesn &apos;t necessarily need to china in the middle of a world map . 
this map , with a view . 
compare reading is not new . 
it &apos;s in the academic standard practice . 
比较文学 , even be a religion that research . 比较文学 , even be a religion that research . 
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding . contrast control let academics for a project has a full understanding . 
and i wonder , if you read on useful , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ? 
so i started putting a book about to read . 
they can be about the same events different parties , they can be about the same events different parties , or two friends have a shared experience . 
jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desire and fear and social responsibility -- interesting . 
if you know , the book , and you like two language . contrast read is very interesting . 
so thomas 默 . the translator , &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 watts translation of the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost , i was one that translation can lead to harvest . 
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning , but it &apos;s called &quot; rapid joy , &quot; well ... 
chinese bride , &quot; the word &quot; means it &apos;s literally for &quot; new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
books , and has become an amazing discovery 今人 communication has become a portal , books and 今人 lack of communication , a magic . 
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless . 
other people &apos;s suffering , than 破灭 dream . not what other people &apos;s suffering , than not what 破灭 dream . 
i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose . 
it &apos;s the most important purpose to touch , let &apos;s dream sources of places where the source , passion , happiness , the source . 
even a broken 灭 dreams can also make your experiencing that touch . 
because the book , i &apos;m happy to this , to live life of purpose and meaning , to become clear , in most of the time . 
and you will never wish at any age . 
thank you .

帕鲁尔 de 塞加尔 : envy 颂歌 . 
when i was eight in the class , new to a woman . she &apos;s compelling , like all new girls to that . 
she &apos;s a lot of 秀发 光泽 put a cute little 文具盒 specialize in a name that week , the capital that no one can than spell . 
that year , i was the people were envy until i think of the evil . 
one day i from school , and the second 逗留 and leave it to a night , i &apos;ve been silently sit on the toilet 
and it &apos;s a 出动 , i was to go from a classroom teachers table scores for it . 
and then i conspiracy win by stopping . 
and i change my opponents scores only changed a little bit , is to a certain 降级 wait . 
well , it &apos;s all a 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other students and high score to awfully ! 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all the way , but not and creativity 
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line , because i &apos;ve been in this , more to do something completely 
i still didn &apos;t understand my behavior . 
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out . 
i don &apos;t understand why do when they &apos;re very good 
i was feeling great . 
i don &apos;t understand why i had never been found 
i mean , this thing to do so . 
i hasn &apos;t been found . 
but it &apos;s important is , why i care about this girl , in this tiny little girls so good at this point in time to spell ? i confusion . 
envy threw me 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that babies are jealous of torture 
also know that a primate envy , very to envy 知更鸟 blue . 
we know that &apos;s the agents spouse murder . 
but i never read an research could explain , &quot; envy lonely , &quot; it &apos;s a long time , or it &apos;s cruel . 
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study &quot; envy , &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
actually , i don &apos;t know this is not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we will have literature ? 
if not 忠 ocean &apos;s , &quot; there is no odyssey . &quot; 
no 妒忌 where the king , there is no &quot; 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we have read 书单 high school , because we &apos;re losing a 喧嚣 &quot; with &quot; are losing &quot; remarkable &quot; is the gates than the sun rises , &quot; are lost 包法利 &quot; lady , &quot; &quot; anna 卡列琳 her . &quot; 
no , no 普鲁斯 jealous . now , i mean , i know that people always say , love 普鲁斯 all know what to envy , but he did this thing to understand . 
this is his 巨著 年华 water 追忆 &quot; with &quot; 一百周年 this piece is about as well , it &apos;s the research that we can think of common 竞争性 , which is that i was . 
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we will think about the emotional details , right ? 
we want to a small boy is 入梦 
think about a 玛德琳 薰 in 衣草茶 of cake . 
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye . 
he &apos;s so cold , no compassion 
these books in virginia 伍尔夫 , it seems like a cat gut . 
i don &apos;t know what is the cat , but we can suppose it 坚 顽石 as . 
we look at these things come together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and 普鲁斯 and there &apos;s envy . 
妒忌 comes down to people , from that desire , as a firm foundation narrative is not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s a sensitive nerve to me , because we just think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we get jealous , we &apos;ll make myself a story . 
people tell a story about his life , these stories make us feel bad because they have to make the is we &apos;d suffered . 
we tell ourselves as stories , and the audience know exactly where join in the details where 一刀 lethal . right ? 
let us all to envy amateur novelist 普鲁斯 , and that can understand . 
all she did what i &apos;m happy thing will give people happy , maybe it &apos;s happening now . &quot; 
this is he started to their crochet story and 普鲁斯 , the portraits , every lover of that he &apos;s a new glamour him , &quot; sexual 虐 密室 together in a series of tools . &quot; 
now we have to admit , 斯万 普鲁斯 and two people , the infamous envy . 
you know , the 普鲁斯 , if they want to talk to my boyfriend 分手 that he had to escape from this country . 
but you don &apos;t need so jealous will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
and you &apos;re body 疲 envy 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , have to get . 
envy like ? 
envy love information . 
like detail . 
like a big put 光泽 秀发 文具盒 cute . 
envy like . 
this is the reason that instagram . 
普鲁斯 , it will academic language with envy 相联 language . 
when the millions of struggle in his envy , and he started standing in front of him to bribe 偷听 lover servants &apos; quarters he defense for this behavior . 
he said , &quot; look , i know you think that annoying , but it and interpret a 古文 , or watching a monument no two . &quot; 
he said , &quot; these are the science of research , there &apos;s really knowledge value . &quot; 
shame , grief , loss : these are 普林斯 , to wisdom . 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman to our pain that we all emotions than , let &apos;s interested in a genius , can have more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel woman ? 
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s . 
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotion would let &apos;s see their own hostility ugly trying to heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that wrote that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think his wife , and so he did 憔悴 ours . 
freud think this guy kind of weird , because he doesn &apos;t really concerned with his wife do . 
because with his wife &apos;s , you know . 
this poor guys just 缘由 , no doubt . 
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move . 
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it &apos;s able to describe this novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right . 
well , we get jealous , the more intense , we will be more often . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something violence or illegal . 
envy causes us to become very extreme behavior . 
i admit , i think about eight years old , but i also think about yourself on the news see a story . 
michigan 一个52岁 women discovered register a false facebook account and used to account for a year sending their malicious news . 
a year . for a year . 
she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before he girlfriend . now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her . 
because , i want to say that , you face reality . 
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , isn &apos;t it ? 
this comes from fiction . 
a novel , 海史密斯 翠西亚 . 
i really love 海史密斯 is writers . 
she &apos;s in the united states 文学史 brilliant and 诡 a page . 
tom , universal , for example , in her case , the most famous . 
里普利 started to you , or what you want to have , and then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in a basement 应答 his name , and you wear your ring spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but how do we do ? we cannot 里普利 over . 
i couldn &apos;t give a huge change the world , one day , even if i want to be able to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in the age of admire 
we live in envy . 
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , isn &apos;t it ? 
we can novel solutions to i don &apos;t know ? 
so we &apos;re going to 学学 novel character , and see where they met puzzles and the thing is , don &apos;t know how to do . 
let &apos;s go back to the b 贝克街 221 夏洛克 ask 福尔摩斯 leonardo 
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would competitors , rivals into his 里亚蒂 professor -- this crime genius 
but i &apos;ve been more like a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face scottish 头子 . he was very 福尔摩斯 need to him , but hate him . 
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this . 
he &apos;s 雷斯 垂 to help , and to hate him in the case of mysterious 侦破 苦闷 again , always story 
we proud of you . &quot; 
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold hands with 福尔摩斯 
this is 少数几次 福尔摩斯 we see in the way , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it &apos;s like to envy as a geometry , instead of emotions . 
this minute , 福尔摩斯 雷斯 standing 垂 de opposite 
the next minute they stand in the same . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he was hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if envy is really a geometric to do , a question of how we choose your relationship with other questions ? 
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent . 
we &apos;ll chase . 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction 
it has been going on with envy fiction 
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it , please . 
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy , millions , there &apos;s 马塞尔 普鲁斯 , there . 
we have so good . 
thank you . 
so , in new york 内格尔 : i found in the trash . 
so when i was 10 , once and dad went up to that camp mountains 阿第伦 . that &apos;s a place in the new york in the wild . 
it was really good weather . 
the forest searched twinkling lights . 
the leaves shine sunlight , when from 晶莹 , like the stained glass . if you don &apos;t feet small way , we all think we can get to this place is the first human . 
we eventually got to our camp . 
that &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at the 水晶 晶莹 of a beautiful lakes , and i actually found a bad thing . 
in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing . 
people to camp was too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would 善后 clean for them ? 
and i have this question bedeviled . it was a longer sound bite . 
who to clean we leave the garbage ? 
but you can take this problem on any place you live in a clean 伊斯坦 . we leave the garbage ? 
in rio clean we leave the garbage ? in paris and london ? 
in new york , here , is sanitation trucks were parked department cleaned up to 11 , we leave the garbage and 000吨 2000吨 every day of the recycled . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know , who are doing this work . 
in the sanitation trucks were parked on up in a sense of responsibility for what ? 
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project . 
i was sitting in the car , along the lines on the new york at the office , all the sanitation trucks were parked people live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i really got the sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not 垃圾车 sitting in , i open 垃圾车 . 
my own manipulate the electric 扫帚 铲 its street , in the snow . 
that &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process . 
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell . 
there is smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad . but very soon , you will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even a few years of working side worker , their body in a week and try to adapt to megatons of garbage . 
so there is at risk . 
with the labor 统计局 report , the sanitation trucks were parked work is one of the most dangerous tasks . i slowly and figure out why . 
you all day on the road , which are of traffic . 
out of the cars , thinking only than you drive , people often not enough to be careful . 
sanitation trucks were parked workers for me , it was so bad . 
well , and the itself is poisoning , these 毒物 often from 垃圾车 comes out , in a terrible harm . 
i also learned the cruel and frightening . 
when you &apos;re walking down the sanitation trucks were parked car 路沿 , in a city , you &apos;ll see you realize that the really like the power of nature itself . 
it never is 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like breath , or a form of cycle . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , it was called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked . 
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important labor . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient every day , and the waste from the container itself , it sort of poison will in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we attacked several 和数 century after 10 years of disease , again , there will be to threaten our health . 
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , we would have no space with something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less . 
i don &apos;t use capitalism , here i just point out their relationship . 
and the third reason -- that &apos;s what i call 经常性 , on average , we need for speed of activity . 
i mean , in the days , and today , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know that there is a work in teams densest put these things were sitting over there . 
so today i want you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked workers that situation , maybe to help them . they &apos;re called please come to talk about how to build a sustainable people , the city . 
i think their work is a noble . 
every time they , in the street to individual hard work . 
in many cities , they wear sanitation trucks were parked suit of work . 
you know , they would be to clean the on time . 
they allow us to secure in their work . 
they almost became secure work promise . 
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and waste . anyway , all this work is going to keep stability . 
september 11th , 2001 , the next day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and pull , my little son and ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 week doing . 
i want to thank him do these work in that particular day , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy . 
his name 保利 times , we have been working together , and become friends . 
i want to believe that 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we , as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we have to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
the city , that we know of garbage actually only about three percent of all the garbage . 
this is an amazing data . 
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the garbage , please find a time 致意 to them . 
find a time to say thank you . 
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory . 
please close your eyes to me . 
imagine you &apos;re standing outside your door . 
please attention 一下门 materials , and the colors . 
now , imagine a naked people on the overweight .

her wear exposed to your coffee table dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot; 
and i came in with your kitchen . 
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 to get out of your oven , you go to the track is &quot; 绿野 仙 in dorothy 铁皮 稻草人 people walking arm in arm with lions 蹦蹦跳跳 on their hands , came to you . 
okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;m going to talk to you about a year , spring in new york are going to do the unexpected . 
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory . 
a few years ago , i 科技类 as a journalist to the competition with this thought about there to be like geeks who &quot; super bowl 冠军赛 bustling right . &quot; 
a bunch of men and women grew up 屈指可数 old to some girls don &apos;t notice and personal health 
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that the hundreds of any list numbers . 
some populations in trying to remember the names of the strangers 
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem . 
and in the race to the fastest speed , who can remember the order of the cards 一整副 打乱 . 
i was like , that &apos;s amazing . 
these people surely 禀 other talents 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training . 
i asked him , &quot; ed what you are , started to realize their memory is genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; what i &apos;m not . 
and my memory was . 
the game to every single person will tell you they memory is just generally . 
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of ? &quot; 
we stood outside the hall 过人 smart amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio on how britney 一整副 remember 打乱 card order . 
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me ! 
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot; 
and then a very strange journey unfold in front of me 序幕 . 
most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and research on memory , i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he suffers amnesia his memory was probably the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia really amazing . 
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can understand memory in any way to shape our personality . 
this is another extreme i met somebody like this . 
his name is kim peek 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; characters in . 
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library , and i think is just fascinating back phone books . 
and i went back home and i read a lot about memory wrote papers on the 两千多年 ago in latin write from ancient until then , during the medieval 
i learned a lot of interesting things . 
one is used to train illegal beam culture memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 people want to send their memory 不遗余力 can to your mind . 
these technologies for modern life possible , but also we change . 
not only in the culture , and i think in the cognitive 
kids don &apos;t need to memory sometimes think we have to remember how memory . 
in this piece of the earth has very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam culture that memory of an extraordinary memory . 
it &apos;s not that extraordinary to do this all over the world . 
i was fascinated with that these people want to know how to do it . 
a few years ago london of the university of researchers asked to a contest to study memory . 
they want to understand the human brain , we do to others in anatomically structure different ? 
the answer is no . 
and they are smarter than us ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had negative . 
but compared with the goal is to control the memory up there are brain actually had a very interesting is that the different . 
these people were sent to do functional mri scan the brain when they &apos;re memory number or 人脸 or kind pattern , researchers found that memory . there are activated brain areas with ordinary people don &apos;t . 
notice that they think , is in the brain in space memory and navigation when they used to . 
why ? what can we figure out what the conclusion ? 
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective memory show 赛场 and other ways to catch up . 
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there . 
in his 台前 三十六副 have 打乱 card he in order to get an hour down with a all his own invented it , he would have the skills . 
and it &apos;s in this way , he was not a bad word 4140个 back down to any one of binary . only half an hour . 
a cow . 
in the competition 参赛者 of using a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all the skills and can to into a concept psychologists call a delicate code . &quot; 
this idea can humor with a paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox of simple is that i have two people to remember one word to you and i said , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot; 
that &apos;s a baker . 
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot; 
after a while back and i find you ask , &quot; remember what i call you remember before the word ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what word ? &quot; 
they were told 人名 baker &apos;s people remember the possibility of a word away , not as being told a baker that person . 
the same word to different memories . 
why is what ? 
because without any particular 人名 baker . 
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any . 
but baker used it as a word that we all know what &apos;s baker 
baker with funny white cap . 
they hand and flour . 
they came home from work with a toast 扑鼻 . 
maybe some people have friends are baker 
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to produce all kinds of ways that we can , in this after a while , can still remember . 
this precise memory skills 两千五百年 in front of the ancient greeks have . 
and call it through . 
developed this technique . this is a simonides called the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party 
and he &apos;s been asked to do , because in the performing guest in the fancy party cool standard is not just d. j. to play reduction , but to please poet ode to . 
he stood up back out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 , and he had gone out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died . 
not all death all of them were 面目全非 to come down on 
nobody says that you have to have some of the people who don &apos;t like to tell who &apos;s sitting 
to the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬 
this whole thing and reinforce the tragedy of color . 
simonides standing outside the rubble as the only survivors close your eyes thrust upon realized that , in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 are sitting . 
he was hold the hand through ruins relative to take their loved ones around . 
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we don &apos;t name the phone to remember every word or colleagues command , we all have very keen visual or space memory . 
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i just simonides story about 10 years ago , &quot; should not many people will remember . 
but i bet , if i show you now back down in the foyer . you &apos;re sitting in would speak 骏马 brown on who you understand what i mean . 
this advice from the latin 两千多年 ago , the first memory . 
so this phrase , what is the principles ? 
if you were invited to stand in the center of the ted stage 脱稿 and you want to talk to 西塞罗 like in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the general 霸气 that he would go one , and you want . 
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their 
and then imagine working with a completely crazy memorable like to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster mr. ed sitting on the back . 
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook . 
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney like you to think about going to talk about that little story about britney 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association 
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just reciting will only 添麻烦 flat , but remember , one by one . 
actually phrase &quot; theme : &quot; is from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is 古时候 people to talk about or rhetorical when they use in space . 
&quot; the phrase &quot; means that your memory palace 第一层 . 
it &apos;s too much fun for me it up a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started 萌发 a more detailed it that the memory of my culture . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is memory process is very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there . 
it &apos;s not very exciting moment is a small source 揉 somebody 揉 . 
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing ! 
i know that these people in the brain is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see 外人 as 
i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience . 
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 spend 20 minutes to try something . 
put back little poem . 
back in 跳蚤市场 back and i bought a 年鉴 old people . 
i was surprised to find that it &apos;s actually very 带劲 
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise 
interesting is actually goal is not going to train memory . 
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working to create the myth is completely funny 胡乱 your memorable . 
and it became my fun . 
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit . 
it &apos;s a 耳塞 镜面 all 护目镜 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory is the biggest enemies attention distributed 
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 . 
i want to drive a signed up to it as an experiment in the news . 
when i thought to be in 前言 调侃 yourself as well . 
the question is , experiment finally get unexpected consequences . 
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
back to me now talk 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks memory works is because the human brain 依仗 them some basic principles . 
and don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember 几副 the order of the cards and you can actually from understanding brains have some benefits of principle . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 that is not . 
powerful memory is can acquire . 
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember 
engaged , can remember 
memory palace , or that memory skills are just 捷径 . 
and in the end , they can &apos;t be 捷径 
this work is because forces you to think about it . 
it forces you to go deeper to make you more focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to the training 
actually 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist . 
this is that we have to remember things . 
i found that we experience with your own body 潜藏 with an amazing memory . 
but if you want to live memorable is to do that remember often memory . 
thank you . 
who 沃斯 duke pull lee : the key to success willpower ? 
on my 27th , i resigned as a very challenging companies -- to professional management , turn it into a more challenging professional : education . 
i came to some of the new york city public schools to teach seven grade math . 
and other teachers , as i &apos;m going to give students do little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
when these 试卷 assignment and open up , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst students between the only difference . 
some are good 课业 in the students don &apos;t have very high iq score on . 
some very smart kids , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 . 
this got me thinking . 
and of course , students in seven grade need to learn that there is hard , like rates , small number , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation . 
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , as long as they would spend time and effort . 
after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in education , we need to learn from the perspective of psychology and perspective , to students and learning . take a more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we all know the great evaluating students standard iq is , but if you &apos;re in school and the good life do not just dependent on the far more efficient the ability to learn for you ? 
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids and large people , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and in treaties study , and my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they success ? 
i and my research group 西点 research , to point out . 
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out . 
before we go to see the word competition , and also try to predict what kids can level-up to the end of the game . 
we study in hostile environment work work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students . 
we work with 私企 , they sell to ask what people can stay in . 
what can the more money ? 
in all the different context , a character that no one out , which was largely predicted success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
it &apos;s not beautiful appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is for long-term goal passion and carry on . 
tenacity is a sustainable 恒 something happened . 
tenacity is you for the future , every day on , is not just for a week or a month , but a few years for decades trying to make their dream and reality . 
tenacity is to life as a marathon . it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower . 
i &apos;m about to 千名 初中生 on the survey and willpower , waiting for more than a year , and look at what graduate students can . 
all is not just in the country , or 西点 point in the competition to build words that willpower . this is also in school , especially for those 徘徊 drop out in the edge of the kids . 
for my own self , about willpower me the most incredible things is heading for willpower , we develop willpower , in the cognitive science , to understand that was how poor . 
every day have parents and teachers to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and how to move their long-term is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t allow you to gritty heart . 
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , what we see this data , tenacity usually has nothing to do with other factors , even with the brilliance scale run counter . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard about children to be resilient in the most effective , called &quot; growing mindset . &quot; 
william 卡洛杜 at stanford university , with a view , and he believed in people &apos;s ability to learn , it can change the way , and as you try to change . 
杜威克 professor means , when kids learn to read about the brain and knowledge and it facing challenges , what happens is , they fail to grow up and then more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure . 
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower . 
but we need more . 
and so i decided to close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is facing in front of the work . 
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , to benefit from the experience from these fail again and again . 
in other words , we just have to become more willpower make our kids to become more have willpower . 
thank you . 
泽维尔 dimensions , that the : into local culture . 
as an architect , i was in architecture and design , to think about buildings , around with the environment , , and building around with the environment , which is the relationship between tradition . 
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea . 
these two examples are in the country , a in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
one of these cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture analysis , made a design solutions important components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall . 
this was my team and i get the same example , we were asked to design it looks like . 
i first saw this feeling is , i really don &apos;t want to do . 
look at the same in this kind of the building , the city -- there &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we discovered these buildings , the most important three questions . 
first of all , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , people are not the big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because architecture is were outside this design glass , to heat stuck inside this leads to , in architecture , we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in the city , because the cities climate is very 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 左右. 25度 . 
the third problem is the building looks a little bit of a relationship with africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t . 
for a 底蕴 culture and abundance of the city , it &apos;s called people down . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was so fascinated with the local 集贸市场 . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the built environment , in the hands of 小商贩 from to buy products . 
this is the same idea to me , is in outdoor public setting create all kinds of activity idea . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 in building this idea ? 
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the photo , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist . 
and this building back and forth on the street in front , two parallel 几百米 , there are no little can connected . 
so we need to do is we use this very building a portal , all the way to connect these two together . 
and then we have a gradient 庭 of design , create an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian 日晒雨淋 by . 
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same . 
i think , the question is , the walls of the building . how ? 
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment . 
and i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building . 
we from ethiopia women beautiful pattern of the traditional dress got inspiration . 
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls . 
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and control in the way we light into the building . 
in order to do this point , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night . 
one of these ideas , but we don &apos;t touch , to build their response , sort of , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all know , the design solutions to than traditional mall solution to make more money , because this design solutions to sell shop number more . 
and this outside walls design , down the cost of many , many , it &apos;s not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than the glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of air conditioning to control the temperature . 
and we ultimately save part of the budget . 
builds stage of the first question is , think about how to make sure that building in the power of the city , because we are almost every day to pull 闸 . electricity . 
so we were on the roof , in a lot of solar panels . 
and then we thought , can on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to rest here , to be in cities , for people 小憩 oasis . 
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to building inside the clean . 
we &apos;ve built to 第五层 predicted , in the next year , well . 
the second example is a city plan for tunisia 2000套 than collateral infrastructure and an apartment building . 
do this big scale project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i need not just very deep sense of tunisia , and to understand the city with her all kinds of tradition and culture . 
and in the process of my attention by a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is the structure of history has a brick wall , over thousands of years , there are 12 structure through the door , 相互之间 is almost straight to the road . 
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 basic small areas in size and all the characteristics we like to in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning . 
these blocks in planning basis , any mentioned idea , we have a few key points , the key to connect with a straight line , to change a model . 
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , like a cubicle , is made this big planning basic components . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , towards what &apos;s the best ? 
and the answer is 南北朝 , can use to 南北 house on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we do this pattern , and all the apartments have perfect facing . 
this is the effect , as we design a city style together , the house with a combination of european style . 
there &apos;s some building with the garden walking around on the ground , and the whole sidewalks to connect . 
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 population density of the population density high , not very expensive . 
and she &apos;s to satisfy our entry out between 通性 even asked . 
this is the roof of the project i 得意 the most part , it &apos;s like to be these buildings takes up space to gave community . 
the community can climb on the roof and poke somebody talk to each other , my god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or in the back and forth between jump . 
these two in some cases , in the design process with the same way . 
again , they were in the city , you can literally see buildings 拔地而起 one by one . 
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate . 
for this reason , i think about the architectural design for me , the more important , is , how simple and find solutions , cheap enough to enhance and to the local people , and civic relationship , and to make people good close to nature . 
thank you very much . 
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said that the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche . 
i think there are three things like this . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a broad consensus . 
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 . 
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task . 
i think people to this proposition , purpose and task that are wrong . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is this proposition , with a purpose and a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is proposition : why people think 信任感 in down ? 
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but that is that in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls polls , to find out about 信任感 in decline . 
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this idea . 
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe it &apos;s journalists and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted . 
and 20 years ago is highly trust people and the judge , for example , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in society 居中 these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
polls records , of course , is that some people . 
or you can record polls ? 
but it &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , what they would say . 
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ? 
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot; 
you trust sell fish ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart the ask . 
when you understand what &apos;s the problem , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
very rational answer . 
in short , in our real life , we in different ways for trust . 
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the official administration , and people , be kind of it . 
for example , i would say , i certainly believe that a primary school math teacher i know how to teach students reading . but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus . 
maybe , and i know she &apos;s not really a good driver . 
i might believe i drink that love to a friend &apos;s friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , he &apos;s a secret . 
it &apos;s that simple . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 said , well why polls , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ? 
i think poll is a very bad 信任感 measure whether there &apos;s an idea . because it 抹杀 people poor judgment . good to think about 信任感 poor judgment . 
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ? 
it is , we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think that it was funny . 
i think this is not the purpose . 
i would say , it should be trusted people more to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people . 
in fact , i mean , it was trying not to trust not trusted people . 
for example , who put their savings to that looks like it &apos;s like they were money to roll out 麦道 夫 mr. people , i think that &apos;s how , people say that , right , so easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
wise to trust and smart to choose not to trust that that &apos;s the purpose . 
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important not to trust , but reputation of ? 
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy . 
i think , to make decisions about the need to think about three . 
to see if they do ? honest allows you to do ? good ? 
if we think that allows you to a person is , in his own area is allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe in them , because they can trust . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not , and they went to help me to send messages , because they forget it . 
i was very confident some friends , and they really can do , but i think some of them too confident . 
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to be reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest . 
maybe there is , i &apos;ve never found . 
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation of . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the rules , is to be a professional level or official on these making it easier for us to determine whether a reputation . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like they have to do things like that . 
i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 接生 than a child and hard . &quot; 
in our public life , our institutions lives , we find a lot of questions . the institution accountability for the institutions that can enable their reputation as can be trusted by institutions to see , it &apos;s the opposite . 
and this allows people to focus on my own work , like 助产士 them , and they take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned . 
you actually have this experience . 
about purpose to talk about lots and lots of . 
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , are attitude , not all of you here . 
and third , about the task . 
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got the . 
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust . 
well , we can do it for yourself . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but off the what , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from other people . 
you can &apos;t rebuild them for about you . 
you need to make any 家信 people trying to get you . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
and of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful , based on , let them know that you are trustworthy . 
how to do that ? 
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , all institutions , always trying to do it very effective . 
i give you just a simple marketing , for example . 
i can say there &apos;s a store to buy me come back , they never ask any questions . 
and they take 退货 退货 , i will give me , or change color is my favorite socks . 
it &apos;s good . i trust them because they make . i think they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very good trustworthy an idea . say to yourself , you have confidence . 
so finally , about our intention is not so hard to tell . 
people are trustworthy people , and is a relationship between the people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
科林 托克斯 : the film , the manhood . 
as the father made me happy , is that you want to see the movie . 
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter was four years old , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
and then a few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
and she put their dressed like 仙女 as was holding 魔杖 . 
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you see this film is so special . 
now , we live , raise kids , are in a fantastic children into a complicated world . 
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot; 
it &apos;s not like that . 
that trend is 40 years later today &apos;s popular . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 毛绒绒 and a guy to mimic the enemy of safeguard to save a girl . 
you know , that &apos;s what movie ? ... 
right . 
well , this film , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of different 绿野 仙 to track , &quot; we see all the film in recent years 两三 . there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first of all , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence in . 
it &apos;s the sort of violence , like , for instance . 
but i think if we today 绿野 film &quot; 仙 tracking 巫师 , say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of people . 
use your magic slippers 巫婆 bad to beat the army . &quot; 
but , it &apos;s not like that . 
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; special . it &apos;s shown in the most heroic role , intelligence , even bad are women . 
i was in a few years later , together with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized this , that it &apos;s a slightly different . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
it was three . 
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him look . 
but as a home for a second child , his care suddenly sort of a lot . 
and he also run in , and then the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck are born with the duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , obviously , but he was one of them . 
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons . 
it &apos;s video theme of courage and willpower and faithful ? 
also , or 卢克 joins the army remove the fact that the government ? 
&quot; 绿野 一下1939年 contrast 仙 tracking . &quot; 
dorothy is how to win ? 
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders . 
and i hope to their kids in this environment -- oz world -- up , and not to beat up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality . 
why do we give children have so many movies , violence , so little yellow brick way ? 
for women &apos;s film about men &apos;s violence impact , a lot of good analysis , you should look at articles written . good . 
the atmosphere for boys impact , i read the article not that much . 
and my own experience , 从莱娅 , what about the environment guide me not to get to experience in real life , adult world adults to children into the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; 混居 men and women . 
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the end of the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
i do a mission , won 芳 heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t know what to do . 
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 . 
and of course , the example is a lot , and i would in front of you for disney princess are defense . 
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not these films this audience . 
these films , there &apos;s a big a all because it &apos;s taught how girls against 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society . 
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 . 
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to all of you recommend this film . now are being shown in . 
you remember the brave legends of criticism , &quot; just project ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 and started to do the movies . &quot; 
that &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , almost all of these films , not by &quot; 贝克德 test . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
this test for people who don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do about them . 
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her , and a friend in and they saw the movie about content . 
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
think about the standard . 
if , female characters in movies , to do that ? 
if you have to , with their common 心上人 talk about content ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women , to have to speak , there . 
it &apos;s this movie . i &apos;ve seen in , but we &apos;ve seen , and like the film is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen quality a nice movie 阿尔戈 . &quot; 
oscar for the movie , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film , most of what &apos;s happening in plot 人质 has been hijacked 使馆 big events in , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see for scene , men are profound and be in conversation with anxiety . and one of the movie actor , the nice story is the next door , and said , &quot; you sleep , honey ? &quot; 
this is hollywood . 
look at statistics . 
2011 100部 ago , the most popular movies , how many film a heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
just universal picked congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , and that proportion is good . 
so this ratio , higher than that , and the percentage of you will get shock . 
last year , new york times published a paper by government done . 
here &apos;s content . 
the united states every five women in a 性骚扰 ever met . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s popular entertainment , had wrong . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s because children that movie . 
i even think porn music and movie with this is not just relationships , but certainly where a problem . when i heard this , i was thinking about statistics 性骚扰 is the population is so much . 
who are they ? how they were teaching out ? 
they leave school ? 
they have don &apos;t have to understand the film plot men , a hero beat 残暴 反派 and get the glory and reward -- is a without friends and not speak woman ? 
we have to learn from the story of what ? 
you know , as a daughter to raise the father , i tell you all the parents , as people to the statistics and around the world , we &apos;re going to be 危机感 prevent them . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be a very important way , i was mainly about my father said . 
i think we should be for our boys to show you a new manhood . 
now manhood definition had putting the cart before the horse . 
you already know the new economy environment men , women are changing the role of his family 胡口 at home . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters , you know , she said , who ? 
欧 than -- wangari 
欧 than -- wangari , and the than 葛琳 and up to 
what they have in common ? 
maybe there &apos;s no relationship with beautiful clothes . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their own movies than others have more knowledge with others , and to help people share their knowledge for potential . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i want my daughter &apos;s pursuit of this , we hope to my son &apos;s pursuit of this . 
i hope this for more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism . 
i want to tell you a story about a little kid . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know the story 
he lived in the south , a small village . 
this is from the capital 加迪休 &apos;s village . 
this little village drought because it &apos;s been so poor people 食不果腹 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the somali , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities . 
he got to opportunities , no , no , no prospects . 
and only lived in the town in the country &apos;s 加迪休 . 
about a year in the past , and there &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch . 
he &apos;s alive with a bunch of people , and he got rest . 
and he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes , can give their own native to send money . 
and he introduced to a young girl . 
and they did . 
he started a new life . 
life also has his goal . 
one day in &apos;s 加迪休 碧蓝 in the sky happened a car bombing . 
this is the city of my little boy is that the bomb , and when that help dynamic people &apos;s &quot; the party and al qaeda , &quot; a terrorist organization relationships . 
this little boy just want to go through a city through the story of why he &apos;s a suicide attack for the end ? 
he actually wait . 
he was waiting for a chance to wait for the future of he can move a road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road . 
this is going to be like him from 成年期 waiting for the first encounter . 
and he was in the same story with different center in the world . 
this is a story about taken from the power of the city , the story of the young unemployed . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 started riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out . 
for young people , cities with dreams 大城市 to work , it means opportunities , wealth , but not to enjoy their young people in the city . 
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment . 
in 2030 , five people living in cities , there &apos;s three is under 18 to people . 
if we in urban development , not to young people . think about , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and gang 雷池 these will be the future of cities . 
i was born in the city &apos;s 加迪休 , 70 percent of the people in unemployment . 
70 percent didn &apos;t work didn &apos;t read books . 
basically do nothing 
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing in the eye hospital was full of play in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it be ? 
if i get to in the same 成年期 waiting for ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
and i did say no . 
last month , i actually 加迪休 &apos;s back to the reason is to have a young leadership and entrepreneurship learn summit 
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership 
we sat down and working together to solution cities are the biggest problem . 
one of the room aden called the young people . 
he &apos;s in 加迪休 on a university and graduated . 
there was no job , nothing . 
i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work very frustrated , is &quot; the party &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit . 
the people that look like this . 
but his story , it &apos;s another version 
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and the biggest hurdle is the 
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , actually , it became the easy-to-use tools . 
aden find opportunities and grab it on . 
he built a motorcycle company . 
started a motorcycle cab to the people who couldn &apos;t afford motorcycle 
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆 
he &apos;s the story of how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i believe , is he going to find opportunities and opportunity . 
this is entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is about 成年期 waiting for the most effective tool . 
he drove young people as they had been crazy in search of economic opportunity makers 
you can get trained to young people . 
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a meeting , he called mohamed mohamoud 名花 is a business . 
he was trained in business to help me on the summit of young people train them how to create entrepreneurial innovation . 
if you ask people , &quot; what is the last time you see ? &quot; flowers , civil war was born in time for many of them will be the answer is , &quot; never seen before . &quot; 
so from that mohamed opportunities . 
he started a 园林 greening and companies and design . 
he &apos;s in agriculture 加迪休 go out on a tulip 百合花 and he started to grow , and he said that can take a bad climate 加迪休 &apos;s . 
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s busy 22年 加迪休 &apos;s built the first citizens park . 
now , there &apos;s no citizens 加迪休 &apos;s in park . 
he wanted to create a space for young people , can family together here like he said , to feel and inspire 花香 rose . 
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep . 
they don &apos;t want to business . 
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he of innovation , for those people very big . 
he makes those young people with the opportunity to reframe the city 
he makes they believe they can also be entrepreneurs can also be changing the world . 
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now . 
they came up with a business solution to local problems . 
so that young people creating companies culture is big step across , but people need money to make their ideas . 
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business 
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them from idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for cities 
for me , entrepreneurship is not just open business 
it also create social impact . 
it &apos;s not just sold in doctor-heroes 
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling . 
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , it will be truly change people to the city . 
on the side of the street aden hired to help him a cab to help him and maintain the motorcycle 
he gave them the opportunity to escape from was to get 成年期 wait . 
these young entrepreneurs , all of them have a profound impact cities . 
so my suggestion is that move more young people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more flowers and peace , and the story of the park , there &apos;s not that car bomb and 成年期 waiting for the story . 
thank you . 
薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read the chinese word for . 
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , me , one of the most precious memory is a mother and i showed the chinese word for the care about the beauty of . 
since then , i became obsessed with this wonderful language . 
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to china as 高不可攀 wall . 
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how to tackle this wall , and that to understand and look at this complex language elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way , to learn the chinese word for . 
from five up , i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book . 
fifteen years time , i learn new the chinese word for every day . 
because we are only five minutes time , should have a much more easy faster way of learning . 
a chinese scholar 二万个 that the chinese word for . 
you just need to know the chinese word for a thousand , can read simple literature . 
the chinese word for that top 二百个 , and you see it -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read sign , to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
today i use the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
put your mouth is to get bigger , the better , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words . 
this is a person who is in walking . 
&quot; one word . &quot; 
this is a tree . 
&quot; carpenter . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; signs like wild about comfort in cars on a door . 
i call this eight words for basic words . 
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
a &quot; people . &quot; 
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
there is a saying that , two , three people to get from people for public . 
if somebody open arms , and people said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; in , the people were stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about it being trapped in a whale in . 
that &apos;s a tree . &quot; &quot; carpenter &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot; 
three trees together , is &quot; forest . &quot; 
put a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 on a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot; 
remember to very easy , because a tree , it &apos;s going to speak 呆傻 things . 
remember &quot; fire &quot; ? 
两团 &quot; fire &quot; together , it becomes very hot , &quot; &quot; . 
三团 &quot; fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much . 
it &apos;s two trees in the next , will &quot; burn . &quot; 
for us , the sun is all sources of life . 
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around . 
the three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot; 
when the sun and the moon these together , and that &apos;s &quot; the light . &quot; 
one day after a night , is &quot; tomorrow . &quot; 
and on the horizon , from the sun rises . &quot; 旦 . &quot; 
a &quot; door . &quot; and put the block of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot; 
&quot; bang ! &quot; , someone at home ? 
this was even outside , &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; escape . &quot; 
on the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , maybe have debate . 
three women together , be careful , which is -- &quot; 姦 . &quot; 
we &apos;ve learned about the chinese word for 30 . 
and through this way , this eight basic words can secondary out into 32 the chinese word for . 
the next one , the chinese word for eight offspring out and the chinese word for 32 . 
so , you can easy to learn hundreds of the chinese word for eight years old , this is the chinese children of chinese language . 
these words in school later , we started to build a phrase . 
for example , take &quot; the &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcano . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot; 
we know that japan is the sun rises place . 
here to the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china . 
so to the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot; 
in &quot; the japanese &quot; put a &quot; people , we get what ? &quot; 
&quot; the japanese . &quot; 
the words are stacking up and down the mountain , those two together . 
in the ancient chinese 流亡 , which means , because china clothes 政敌 put in to the mountain . 
today , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go out . &quot; 
&quot; and &quot; a word tell you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot; 
this slide , it reminds me of the talk , and walking down the table . thank you .
