meg jay : why was 20 , 30 is not new .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need mental therapy patient .  (2)
and i was a clinical psychologist in berkeley university read the ph . 3d students .  (3)
she &apos;s a called alex 26 women .  (4)
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off the shoes , and she said to me , she was told me to the men .  (5)
when i heard this , and i disengaged .  (6)
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk to my boys .  (8)
i think i can deal with this thing .  (9)
but i can &apos;t do that .  (10)
alex in every meeting , all that funny story , so to me 点点 on the head , and the result of the time is a very , very easy thing .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is the new , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
in order to have to work , marry later , in order to have to have children , even after death is to have .  (13)
and i like alex 二十几岁 like people , except for the time , nothing .  (14)
but not too long , i have 催 that i started to push alex love life .  (15)
i refuse .  (16)
i said , &quot; yes , she &apos;s now on a date , and she &apos;s the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time is in the best before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment .  (20)
and in that moment , i learned 30 is not new 二十岁 .  (21)
yes , people than ever later 安顿 off , but that doesn &apos;t mean that alex 二十几岁 between , this is her 低谷 development .  (22)
it makes 二十几岁 alex the development of a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there spoil it .  (23)
and i realized that this &quot; kindness oversight , &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for love , alex and her life 二十几岁 around for people with the family .  (24)
now , the united states have about 5千万 二十几岁 people .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can experience 二十几岁 stage in this case , after adults period .  (26)
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand .  (27)
i really wanted to see here , 一些二十几岁 people .  (28)
that &apos;s great ! you &apos;re awesome .  (29)
if you 二十几岁 and the people who work , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you 二十几岁 because people lost and o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome 二十几岁 , people are very important .  (30)
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human lifetime that 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old .  (32)
that means that every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with that . &quot; ! &quot; moment in a place in eight 中旬 30 .  (33)
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money , you will make a very big impact .  (36)
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 before and 终生 同居 married , mate , or on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain 二十几岁 adults , to adapt to the second issue is the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own , what is now change its time .  (38)
we know other than life 二十岁 stage personality , the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do .  (39)
so you 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body in the future , and the choice of the time .  (40)
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago and admiration brain development language is the critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact of time .  (42)
but we hear a few there &apos;s a thing called adults development , and our 二十岁 this stage is adult development of the critical period .  (43)
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
researchers have 二十几岁 called extend adolescence .  (46)
journalist 二十几岁 for people to stupid , like , &quot; the names , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , we have is actually the most important decades 期中 adults a doesn &apos;t matter .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time .  (50)
this is not right ?  (51)
so , when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ?  (52)
nothing happens .  (53)
you take that guy urgency , and worked , but nothing happening .  (54)
and everybody says , &quot; if i just 30 before i started my career &apos;s no problem . &quot; this one .  (55)
but then they start : &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have to .  (56)
i graduated that the best 写写 my résumé . &quot;  (57)
and they start : &quot; 二十几岁 date , like a seat in games .  (58)
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but music is about 30 to stop off a for a start , you sit down .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i married my husband and i think the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently &quot; chair &quot; . &quot;  (60)
二十几岁 here where people ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
well , that sounds that may seem a little bit 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , very high currency here .  (63)
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure .  (64)
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and as research suggests that started 三十几岁 on this stage and do so many things of stress level , and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
in a thousand years later , middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy .  (66)
is that our profession doesn &apos;t want to .  (67)
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or can &apos;t give their kids a people .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people what to do best .  (69)
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do .  (70)
this is a story about a name &apos;s emma women story .  (71)
25 emma , she came to my office with her , because , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art , or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent do at the .  (73)
because cheap , she and her 脾气 show that worked more and more than my boyfriend live together .  (74)
and no matter how difficult 二十几岁 her , she used lives more difficult .  (75)
she &apos;s at a meeting , often cry , but said , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she bought a new address thin , and she took one morning , fill her to people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this a word -- &quot; the blank behind .  (78)
the last 歇斯底里 she looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
now , i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i &apos;ll . &quot;  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know that this is her opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i would not let emma that has decided to work 10 years that flow off .  (84)
so in the next weeks and months , i told the emma in three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women , should all hear things .  (85)
first of all , i tell emma forget her identity crisis and started to accumulate identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value .  (87)
what you do a for what it was like to think of investment .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma career , the future , and nobody knows the future of my own work , but i know that these : identity capital will do more to the identity of capital .  (89)
this is take that one multinational career , that one in and you want to step up to the time .  (90)
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to you can &apos;t called exploration .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of work and get them to count .  (93)
secondly , i tell emma city tribes overestimate .  (94)
the new capital , the new can almost always about out from the inside of the people at the community .  (95)
new things from what we call the weak , like the connection to our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends .  (96)
yes , about half the people who never 二十几岁 jobs , or not full employment .  (97)
but it &apos;s not about half the connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group .  (98)
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connect to your neighbor boss is you get that was not a 张贴 to work .  (99)
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about how information out of science .  (100)
and finally , emma people don &apos;t choose to believe that a family , but we can choose friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people , very quickly emma with 结伴 somebody &apos;s going to create a family , to take her family .  (102)
i told emma choice family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a 20 , 30 than 25 , even better security , the next time , and i agreed .  (104)
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your 同居 sleep , or people don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which means love is treated as rich as work to do that .  (106)
choice family is conscious choices you want to people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose the person you waste your time .  (107)
and how that emma ?  (108)
well , it turns out that we address thin , and she found her an old roommate , a family in another state an art museum work .  (109)
the weak there to help her in a job .  (110)
that job . give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons .  (111)
now , the past five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners .  (112)
she and her a consciously chose people get married .  (113)
she loved her new career , she in love with his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 behind a big enough to 的卡 . &quot; pieces .  (114)
emma story to this thing sounds very simple , but this is my favorite 二十几岁 and the reason why people work .  (115)
it &apos;s so easy to help them .  (116)
people like 二十几岁 just leave los angeles international airport destination , somewhere in the west flights .  (117)
take off , and the change is a little further in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s the difference .  (118)
likewise , or even in 21 29岁 is 25 , a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 years , and even generations have a very big impact .  (119)
here , give a worth spreading 二十几岁 to each of you know , the idea of people .  (120)
it and i learned to say to alex as simple .  (121)
don &apos;t be , you don &apos;t know , or didn &apos;t do definition .  (122)
now , you &apos;re in determines your life .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
李镇河 李镇河 : into the computer : &quot; really &quot; infinite world , to your imagination  (125)
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , we still have a real world and the gap between the virtual world . in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , is a touchscreen glass so thin , and it &apos;s a computer all the people .  (127)
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the good ?  (128)
so i started to try this crazy idea .  (129)
i first build this tool , it can go digital space , if you take a pen that using force on the screen , and a pen pen and will go into a by pixels of the virtual world .  (130)
designers directly in three-dimensional space to their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery .  (131)
so , this is a tool that broke the virtual and real world of boundaries .  (132)
but we are in the hands out .  (133)
how can we reach into and digital information to interactions , and use our flexible hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space move into the work of numbers .  (135)
because in reality window and file space is , pick exactly where they become like shelves from a book , and so easily .  (136)
and you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands stretched or by various model .  (138)
in this example that we &apos;re now entering the digital world .  (139)
but how we can change the role of it to make digital information into our world ?  (140)
in the room that many people have online shopping 退货 and experience .  (141)
but , now than you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 online .  (143)
this is the system , and our body geometry , through the characteristics of driving , or look at a way to show that we look at the time .  (144)
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make our space these visible pixels into a touch can actually get , feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve persian 雷米 together , make it a &quot; matter a little pixels . &quot;  (147)
in this case , this is like we 磁体 spherical shape in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer , this object and people will move into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place .  (148)
it &apos;s the basic principles we stop for a ball , gravity . and it &apos;s magnetically levitated , mechanical sense , technology and drive on a ball together to control movement .  (149)
and for this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , people can movement in the world of matter that can be recorded , back and forever , keep .  (150)
so , it can be remote 编排 dance , and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 over and over again , if you can actually being repeated itself .  (151)
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , is this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force .  (152)
more exciting , it &apos;s not something that is to the computer into a real stuff , but to think , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity .  (153)
and as you can see , digital information will not put things that give us , but we &apos;ll start acts to become part of our physical environment , not cut our connection with the real world .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can get the border , the rest is our enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)

to a new culture and environment , as i used to read , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from small to large use world map .  (189)
i had never realized , it doesn &apos;t necessarily need to china in the middle of a world map .  (190)
this map , with a view .  (191)

he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman to our pain that we all emotions than , let &apos;s interested in a genius , can have more profound and lethal . &quot;  (282)
he was telling us to find cruel woman ?  (283)
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s .  (284)
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ?  (285)
other emotion would let &apos;s see their own hostility ugly trying to heart and what they deserve ?  (286)
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ?  (287)
freud shortly after that wrote that .  (288)
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think his wife , and so he did 憔悴 ours .  (289)
freud think this guy kind of weird because he doesn &apos;t really do focus on what his wife .  (290)
because with his wife &apos;s , you know .  (291)
this poor guys just 缘由 , no doubt .  (292)
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move .  (293)
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ?  (294)
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard .  (295)
fiction writing about this very well .  (296)
it &apos;s able to describe this novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right .  (297)
well , we get jealous , the more intense , we will be more often .  (298)
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something violence or illegal .  (299)
envy causes us to become very extreme behavior .  (300)
i admit , i think about eight years old , but i also think about yourself on the news see a story .  (301)
michigan 一个52岁 women discovered register a false facebook account and used to account for their malicious year sending news .  (302)
a year . for a year .  (303)
she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before he girlfriend . now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her .  (304)
because , i want to say that , you face reality .  (305)
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , isn &apos;t it ?  (306)
this comes from fiction .  (307)
a novel , 海史密斯 翠西亚 .  (308)
i really love 海史密斯 is writers .  (309)
she &apos;s in the united states 文学史 brilliant and 诡 a page .  (310)
tom , universal , for example , in her case , the most famous .  (311)
里普利 started to you , or what you want to have , and then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in a basement 应答 his name , and you wear your ring spend your bank account .  (312)
this is a road .  (313)
but how do we do ? we cannot 里普利 over .  (314)
i couldn &apos;t give a huge change the world , one day , even if i want to be able to do this .  (315)
and unfortunately , because we live in the age of admire  (316)
we live in envy .  (317)
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , isn &apos;t it ?  (318)
we can novel solutions to i don &apos;t know ?  (319)
so we &apos;re going to 学学 novel character , and see where they met puzzles and the thing is , don &apos;t know how to do .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to the b 贝克街 221 夏洛克 ask 福尔摩斯 leonardo  (321)
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would competitors , rivals into his 里亚蒂 professor -- this crime genius  (322)
but i &apos;ve been more like a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face scottish 头子 . he was very 福尔摩斯 need to him , but hate him .  (323)
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this .  (324)
he &apos;s 雷斯 垂 to help , and to hate him in the case of mysterious 侦破 苦闷 again , always story  (325)
we proud of you . &quot;  (326)
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold hands with 福尔摩斯  (327)
this is 少数几次 福尔摩斯 we see in the way , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it &apos;s like to envy as a geometry , instead of emotions .  (329)
this minute , 福尔摩斯 雷斯 standing 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand in the same .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he was hate .  (332)
but what &apos;s so simple ?  (333)
if envy is really a geometric to do , a question of how we choose your relationship with other questions ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent .  (335)
we &apos;ll chase .  (336)
but i love contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
it has been going on with envy fiction  (339)
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it , please .  (340)
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy , millions , there &apos;s 马塞尔 普鲁斯 , there .  (341)

thank you .  (343)
ar de 内格尔 : i found in new york in the trash .  (344)
so when i was 10 , once and dad went up to camp 阿第伦 that mountain . that &apos;s a place in the new york in the wild .  (345)
it was really good weather .  (346)
the forest searched twinkling lights .  (347)
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like 晶莹 stained glass of feet . if you don &apos;t have a way , we all think we can get to this place is the first human .  (348)
we eventually got to our camp .  (349)
that &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at the 水晶 晶莹 of a beautiful lakes , and i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing .  (352)
people to camp was too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would 善后 clean for them ?  (353)
and i have this question bedeviled . it was a longer sound bite .  (354)
who to clean we leave the garbage ?  (355)
but you can take this problem on any place you live in a clean 伊斯坦 . we leave the garbage ?  (356)
in rio clean we leave the garbage ? in paris and london ?  (357)
in new york , here , is sanitation trucks were parked department cleaned up to 11 , we leave the garbage and 000吨 2000吨 every day of the recycled .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know , who are doing this work .  (360)
in the sanitation trucks were parked on up in a sense of responsibility for what ?  (361)
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project .  (362)
i was sitting in the car , along the lines on the new york at the office , all the sanitation trucks were parked people live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
so i really got the sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now i &apos;m not 垃圾车 sitting in , i open 垃圾车 .  (366)
my own manipulate the electric 扫帚 铲 its street , in the snow .  (367)
that &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process .  (368)
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell .  (369)
there is smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad . but very soon , you will adapt .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even a few years of working side worker , their body in a week and try to adapt to megatons of garbage .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
with the labor 统计局 report , the sanitation trucks were parked work is one of the most dangerous tasks . i slowly and figure out why .  (374)
you all day on the road , which are of traffic .  (375)
out of the cars , thinking only than you drive , people often not enough to be careful .  (376)
sanitation trucks were parked workers for me , it was so bad .  (377)
well , and the itself is poisoning , these 毒物 often from 垃圾车 comes out , in a terrible harm .  (378)
i also learned the cruel and frightening .  (379)
when you &apos;re walking down the sanitation trucks were parked car 路沿 , in a city , you &apos;ll see you realize that the really like the power of nature itself .  (380)
it never is 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like breath , or a form of cycle .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , it was called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important labor . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient every day , and the waste from the container itself , it sort of poison will in a very real way threats to our lives .  (387)
we attacked several 和数 century after 10 years of disease , again , there will be to threaten our health .  (388)
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , we would have no space with something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less .  (390)
i don &apos;t use capitalism , here i just point out their relationship .  (391)
and the third reason -- that &apos;s what i call 经常性 , on average , we need for speed of activity .  (392)
i mean , in the days , and today , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know that there is a work in teams were sitting over there to these things is densest .  (395)
so today i want you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked workers that situation , maybe to help them . they &apos;re called please come to talk about how to build a sustainable people , the city .  (396)
i think their work is a noble .  (397)
every time they , in the street to individual hard work .  (398)
in many cities , they wear sanitation trucks were parked suit of work .  (399)
you know , they would be to clean the on time .  (400)
they allow us to secure in their work .  (401)
they almost became secure work promise .  (402)
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and waste . anyway , all this work is going to keep stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the next day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and pull , my little son and ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 week doing .  (404)
i want to thank him do these work in that particular day , but i just cry up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name 保利 times , we have been working together , and become friends .  (409)
i want to believe that 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we as part of this planet , we need to be hard to rebuild . we have to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
the city , that we know of garbage actually only about three percent of all the garbage .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the garbage , please find a time 致意 to them .  (415)
find a time to say thank you .  (416)

and i came in with your kitchen .  (436)
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 to get out of your oven , you go to the track is &quot; 绿野 仙 in dorothy 铁皮 稻草人 people walking arm in arm with lions 蹦蹦跳跳 on their hands , came to you .  (437)
okay , open your eyes .  (438)
i &apos;m going to talk to you about a year , spring in new york are going to do the unexpected .  (439)
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory .  (440)
a few years ago , i 科技类 as a journalist to the competition with this thought about there to be like geeks who &quot; super bowl 冠军赛 bustling right . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of men and women grew up 屈指可数 old to some girls don &apos;t notice and personal health  (442)
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that the hundreds of any list numbers .  (443)
some populations in trying to remember the names of the strangers  (444)
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem .  (445)
and in the race to the fastest speed , who can remember the order of the cards 一整副 打乱 .  (446)
i was like , that &apos;s amazing .  (447)
these people surely 禀 other talents  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to accept the memory of the best training .  (450)
i asked him , &quot; ed what you are , started to realize their memory is genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; what i &apos;m not .  (452)
and my memory was .  (453)
the game to every single person will tell you they memory is just generally .  (454)
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall 过人 smart amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio on how britney 一整副 remember 打乱 card order .  (459)
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me !  (461)
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very strange journey unfold in front of me 序幕 .  (463)
most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and research on the memory , i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and what else is hidden potential .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called e. p .  (466)
he suffers amnesia his memory was probably the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia really amazing .  (468)
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can understand memory in any way to shape our personality .  (469)
this is another extreme i met somebody like this .  (470)
his name is kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; characters in .  (472)
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library , and i think is just fascinating back phone books .  (473)
and i went back home and i read a lot in papers write about memory 两千多年 ago in latin wrote papers from ancient until then , during the medieval  (474)
i learned a lot of interesting things .  (475)
one is used to train illegal beam culture memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people want to send their memory 不遗余力 can to your mind .  (477)
these technologies for modern life possible , but we also change .  (478)
not only in the culture , and i think in the cognitive  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to memory sometimes think we have to remember how memory .  (480)
in this piece of the earth has very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam culture that memory of an extraordinary memory .  (481)
it &apos;s not that extraordinary to do this all over the world .  (482)
i was fascinated with that these people want to know how to do it .  (483)
a few years ago london of the university of researchers asked to a contest to study memory .  (484)
they want to understand the human brain , we do to others in anatomically structure different ?  (485)
the answer is no .  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had negative .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the memory up there are brain actually had a very interesting is that the different .  (489)
these people were sent to do functional mri scan the brain when they &apos;re memory 人脸 number or kind or pattern , researchers found that memory . there are activated brain areas with ordinary people don &apos;t .  (490)
notice that they think , is in the brain in space memory and navigation when they used to .  (491)
why ? what can we figure out what the conclusion ?  (492)
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective memory show 赛场 and other ways to catch up .  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there .  (494)
in his 台前 三十六副 have 打乱 card he in order to an hour down to is that all of his own invented it , he would have the skills .  (495)
and it &apos;s in this way , he was not a bad word 4140个 back down to any one of binary . only half an hour .  (496)
a cow .  (497)
in the competition 参赛者 of using a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all the skills and can to into a concept psychologists call a delicate code . &quot;  (498)
this idea can humor with a paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox of simple is that i have two people to remember one word to you and i said , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
that &apos;s a baker .  (500)
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot;  (501)
after a while back and i find you ask , &quot; remember what i call you remember before the word ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what word ? &quot;  (503)
they were told 人名 baker &apos;s people remember the possibility of a word away , not as being told a baker that person .  (504)
the same word to different memories .  (505)
why is what ?  (506)
because without any particular 人名 baker .  (507)
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any .  (508)
but baker used it as a word that we all know what &apos;s baker  (509)
baker with funny white cap .  (510)
they hand and flour .  (511)
they came home from work with a toast 扑鼻 .  (512)
maybe some people have friends are baker  (513)
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to produce all kinds of ways that we can , in this after a while , can still remember .  (514)
this precise memory skills 两千五百年 in front of the ancient greeks have .  (515)
and call it through .  (516)
developed this technique . this is a simonides called the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he &apos;s been asked to do , because in the performing guest in the fancy party cool standard is not just d. j. to play reduction , but to please poet ode to .  (518)
he stood up back out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 , and he had gone out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died .  (519)
not all death all of them were 面目全非 to come down on  (520)
nobody says that you have to have some of the people who don &apos;t like to tell who &apos;s sitting  (521)
to the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬  (522)
this whole thing and reinforce the tragedy of color .  (523)
simonides standing outside the rubble as the only survivors close your eyes thrust upon realized that , in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 are sitting .  (524)
he was hold the hand through ruins relative to take their loved ones around .  (525)
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we don &apos;t name the phone to remember every word or colleagues command , we all have very keen visual or space memory .  (526)
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i just simonides story about 10 years ago , &quot; should not many people will remember .  (527)
but i bet , if i show you now back down in the foyer . you &apos;re sitting in would speak 骏马 brown on who you understand what i mean .  (528)
this advice from the latin 两千多年 ago , the first memory .  (529)
so this phrase , what is the principles ?  (530)
if you were invited to stand in the center of the ted stage 脱稿 and you want to talk to 西塞罗 like in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the general 霸气 that he would go one , and you want .  (531)
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their  (532)
and then imagine working with a completely crazy memorable like to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster mr. ed sitting on the back .  (534)
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook .  (535)
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney like you to think about going to talk about that little story about britney  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association  (537)
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just reciting will only 添麻烦 flat , but remember , one by one .  (538)
actually phrase &quot; theme is &quot; is from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is people to talk about 古时候 or rhetorical when they use in space .  (540)
&quot; the phrase &quot; means that your memory palace 第一层 .  (541)
it &apos;s too much fun i have this up a lot of interest .  (542)
and then i went to more memory .  (543)
i started 萌发 a more detailed it that the memory of my culture .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory process is very boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there .  (547)
it &apos;s not very exciting moment is a small source 揉 somebody 揉 .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing !  (549)
i know that these people in the brain is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see 外人 as  (550)
i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 spend 20 minutes to try something .  (552)
my little back .  (553)
back in 跳蚤市场 back and i bought a 年鉴 old people .  (554)
i was surprised to find that it &apos;s actually very 带劲  (555)
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise  (556)
interesting is actually goal is not going to train memory .  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working to create the myth is completely funny 胡乱 your memorable .  (558)
and it became my fun .  (559)
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a 耳塞 镜面 all 护目镜 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory is the biggest enemies attention distributed  (561)
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 .  (562)
i want to drive a signed up to it as an experiment in the news .  (563)
when i thought to be in 前言 调侃 yourself as well .  (564)
the question is , experiment got the unexpected consequences  (565)
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
back to me now talk 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important .  (567)
these are little usual tricks  (568)
the usual tricks memory works is because the human brain 依仗 them some basic principles .  (569)
and don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember 几副 the order of the cards and you can actually from understanding brains have some benefits of principle .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 it is not .  (571)
powerful memory is can acquire .  (572)
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember  (573)
engaged , can remember  (574)
memory palace , or that memory skills are just 捷径 .  (575)
and in the end , they can &apos;t be 捷径  (576)
this work is because forces you to think about it .  (577)
it forces you to go deeper to make you more focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to the training  (578)
actually 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist .  (579)
this is that we have to remember things .  (580)
i found that we experience with your own body 潜藏 with an amazing memory .  (581)
but if you want to live memorable is to do that remember often memory .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
who 沃斯 duke pull lee : the key to success willpower ?  (584)
on my 27th , i resigned as a very challenging companies -- to professional management , turn it into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i came to some of the new york city public schools to teach seven grade math .  (586)
and other teachers , as i &apos;m going to give students do little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
when these 试卷 assignment and open up , and then i calculate their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the bottom of the only difference between students .  (590)
some are good 课业 in the students don &apos;t have very high iq score on .  (591)
some very smart kids , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 .  (592)
this got me thinking .  (593)
and of course , students in seven grade need to learn that there is hard , like rates , small number , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation .  (594)
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , as long as they would spend time and effort .  (595)
after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in education , we need to learn from the perspective of psychology and perspective , to students and learning . take a more profound understanding .  (596)
in education systems , we all know the great evaluating students standard iq is , but if you &apos;re in school and the good life do not just dependent on the far more efficient the ability to learn for you ?  (597)
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids and large people , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and in treaties study , and my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they success ?  (599)
i and my research group 西点 research , to point out .  (600)
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out .  (601)
before we go to see the word competition , and also try to predict what kids can level-up to the end of the game .  (602)
we study in hostile environment work work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students .  (603)
we work with 私企 , they sell to ask what people can stay in .  (604)
what can the more money ?  (605)
in all the different context , a character that no one out , which was largely predicted success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
it &apos;s not beautiful appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is for long-term goal passion and carry on .  (610)
tenacity is a sustainable 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is you for the future , every day on , is not just for a week or a month , but a few years for decades trying to make their dream and reality .  (612)
tenacity is to life as a marathon . it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower .  (614)
i &apos;m about to 千名 初中生 on the survey and willpower , waiting for more than a year , and look at what graduate students can .  (615)
all is not just in the country , or 西点 point in the competition to build words that willpower . this is also in school , especially for those 徘徊 drop out in the edge of the kids .  (616)
for my own self , about willpower me the most incredible things is heading for willpower , we develop willpower , in the cognitive science , to understand that was how poor .  (617)
every day have parents and teachers to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ?  (619)
and how to move their long-term is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t allow you to gritty heart .  (622)
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , what we see this data , tenacity usually has nothing to do with other factors , even with the brilliance scale run counter .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard about children to be resilient in the most effective , called &quot; growing mindset . &quot;  (625)
william 卡洛杜 at stanford university , with a view , and he believed in people &apos;s ability to learn , it can change the way , and as you try to change .  (626)
杜威克 professor means , when kids learn to read about the brain and knowledge and it facing challenges , what happens is , they fail to grow up and then more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure .  (627)
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
and so i decided to close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
this is facing in front of the work .  (631)
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice .  (632)
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , to benefit from the experience from these fail again and again .  (633)
in other words , we only have their own to become more willpower have to get our children to become more have willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
泽维尔 dimensions , that the : into local culture .  (636)
as an architect , i was in architecture and design , to think about buildings , around with the environment , , and building around with the environment , which is the relationship between tradition .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea .  (638)
these two examples are in the country , a in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
one of these cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture analysis , made a design solutions important components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall .  (641)
this was my team and i get the same example , we were asked to design it looks like .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is , i really don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
look at the same in this kind of the building , the city -- there &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we discovered these buildings , the most important three questions .  (644)
first of all , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , people are not the big brands .  (645)
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because architecture is were outside this design glass , to heat stuck inside this leads to , in architecture , we need a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in the city , because the cities climate is very 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 左右. 25度 .  (647)
the third problem is the building looks a little bit of a relationship with africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t .  (648)
so for a city of rich 底蕴 culture , it &apos;s called people down .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was so fascinated with the local 集贸市场 . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the built environment , in the hands of 小商贩 from to buy products .  (650)
this is the same idea to me , is in outdoor public setting create all kinds of activity idea .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 in building this idea ?  (653)
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the photo , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building back and forth on the street in front , two parallel 几百米 , there are no little can connected .  (655)
so we need to do is we use this very building a portal , all the way to connect these two together .  (656)
and then we have a gradient 庭 of design , create an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian 日晒雨淋 by .  (657)
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same .  (658)
i think , the question is , the walls of the building . how ?  (659)
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment .  (660)
and i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we from ethiopia women beautiful pattern of the traditional dress got inspiration .  (662)
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls .  (663)
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and control in the way we light into the building .  (664)
in order to do this point , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night .  (665)
one of these ideas , but we don &apos;t touch , to build their response , sort of , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all know , the design solutions to than traditional mall solution to make more money , because this design solutions to sell shop number more .  (667)
and this outside walls design , down the cost of many , many , it &apos;s not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than the glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of air conditioning to control the temperature .  (668)
and we ultimately save part of the budget .  (669)
builds stage of the first question is , think about how to make sure that building in the power of the city , because we are almost every day to pull 闸 . electricity .  (670)
so we were on the roof , in a lot of solar panels .  (671)
and then we can think , on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to rest here , to be in cities , for people 小憩 oasis .  (672)
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to building inside the clean .  (673)
we &apos;ve built to 第五层 predicted , in the next year , well .  (674)
the second example is a city plan for tunisia 2000套 than collateral infrastructure and an apartment building .  (675)
do this big scale project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i need not just very deep sense of tunisia , and to understand the city with her all kinds of tradition and culture .  (676)
and in the process of my attention by a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is the structure of history has a brick wall , over thousands of years , there are 12 structure through the door , 相互之间 is almost straight to the road .  (677)
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 basic small areas in size and all the characteristics we like to in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning .  (678)
these blocks in planning basis , any mentioned idea , we have a few key points , the key to connect with a straight line , to change a model .  (679)
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , like a cubicle , is made this big planning basic components .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , towards what &apos;s the best ?  (681)
and the answer is 南北朝 , can use to 南北 house on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we do this pattern , and all the apartments have perfect facing .  (683)
this is the effect , as we design a city style together , the house with a combination of european style .  (684)
there &apos;s some building with the garden walking around on the ground , and the whole sidewalks to connect .  (685)
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 population density of the population density high , not very expensive .  (686)
and she &apos;s to satisfy our entry out between 通性 even asked .  (687)
this is the roof of the project i 得意 the most part , it &apos;s like to be these buildings takes up space to gave community .  (688)
the community can climb on the roof and poke somebody talk to each other , my god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or in the back and forth between jump .  (689)
these two in some cases , in the design process took the same way .  (690)
again , they were in the city , you can literally see buildings 拔地而起 one by one .  (691)
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate .  (692)
for this reason , i think about the architectural design for me , the more important , is , how simple and find solutions , cheap enough to enhance and promote the local people , and civic relationship , and to make people good close to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said that the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche .  (697)
i think there are three things like this .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a broad consensus .  (699)
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task .  (701)
i think people to this proposition , purpose and task that are wrong .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is this proposition , with a purpose and a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is proposition : why people think 信任感 in down ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but that is that in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing .  (706)
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls polls , to find out about 信任感 in decline .  (708)
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this idea .  (709)
so , in the last 20 years ago by the people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and 20 years ago is highly trust people and the judge , for example , still get altitude of trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in society 居中 these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
polls records , of course , is that some people .  (714)
or you can record polls ?  (715)
but it &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , what they would say .  (716)
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ?  (717)
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
you trust sell fish ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart the ask .  (722)
when you understand what &apos;s the problem , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot;  (723)
very rational answer .  (724)
in short , in our real life , we in different ways for trust .  (725)
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the official administration , and people , it will be types .  (726)
for example , i would say , i certainly believe that a primary school math teacher i know how to teach students reading . but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus .  (727)
maybe , and i know she &apos;s not really a good driver .  (728)
i might believe i drink that love to a friend &apos;s friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , he &apos;s a secret .  (729)
it &apos;s that simple .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 said , well why polls , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ?  (731)
i think poll is a very bad 信任感 measure whether there &apos;s an idea . because it 抹杀 people poor judgment . good to think about 信任感 poor judgment .  (732)
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ?  (733)
it was , we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think that it was funny .  (735)
i think this is not the purpose .  (736)
i would say , it should be trusted people more to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people .  (737)
in fact , i mean , it was trying not to trust not trusted people .  (738)
for example , who put their savings to that looks like it &apos;s like they were money to roll out 麦道 夫 mr. people , i think that &apos;s how , people say that , right , so easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
wise to trust and smart to choose not to trust that that &apos;s the purpose .  (741)
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important not to trust , but reputation of ?  (742)
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy .  (743)
i think , to make decisions about the need to think about three .  (744)
to see if they do ? honest allows you to do ? good ?  (745)
if we think that allows you to a person is , in his own area is allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe in them , because they can trust .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not , and they went to help me to send messages , because they forget it .  (748)
i was very confident some friends , they can do it , but i think some of them too confident .  (749)
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to be reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest .  (750)
maybe there is , i &apos;ve never found .  (751)
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation of .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do .  (754)
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the rules , is to be a professional level or official on these making it easier for us to determine whether a reputation .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like they have to do things like that .  (757)
i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 接生 than a child and hard . &quot;  (758)
in our public life , our institutions lives , we find a lot of questions . the institution accountability for the institutions that can enable their reputation as can be trusted by institutions to see , it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
and this allows people to focus on my own work , like 助产士 them , and they take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually have this experience .  (761)
purpose to talk about lots and lots of .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , are attitude , not all of you here .  (763)
and third , about the task .  (764)
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got the .  (765)
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust .  (766)
well , we can do it for yourself .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but off the what , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from other people .  (770)
you can &apos;t rebuild them for about you .  (771)
you need to make any 家信 people trying to get you .  (772)
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people .  (773)
and of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful , based on , let them know that you are trustworthy .  (775)
how to do that ?  (776)
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , all institutions , always trying to do it very effective .  (777)
i give you just a simple marketing , for example .  (778)
i can say there &apos;s a store to buy me come back , they never ask any questions .  (779)
and they take 退货 退货 , i will give me , or change color is my favorite socks .  (780)
it &apos;s good . i trust them because they make . i think they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
for others , if you make myself in vulnerable , this is a very good trustworthy an idea . say to yourself , you have confidence .  (783)
so finally , about our intention is not so hard to tell .  (784)
people are trustworthy people , and is a relationship between the people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
科林 托克斯 : the film , the manhood .  (787)
as the father made me happy , is that you want to see the movie .  (788)
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter was four years old , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (789)
and then a few months , she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 .  (791)
and she put their dressed like 仙女 as 魔杖 was holding .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you see this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , raise kids , are in a fantastic children into a complicated world .  (794)
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot;  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
that trend is 40 years later today &apos;s popular . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 毛绒绒 and a guy to mimic the enemy of safeguard to save a girl .  (797)
you know , that &apos;s what movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
well , this film , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of different 绿野 仙 to track , &quot; we see all the film in recent years 两三 . there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence in .  (801)
it &apos;s the sort of violence , like , for instance .  (802)
but i think if we today 仙 tracking 绿野 film &quot; 巫师 , say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of people .  (803)
use your magic slippers 巫婆 bad to beat the army . &quot;  (804)
but , it &apos;s not like that .  (805)
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; special . it &apos;s shown in the most heroic role , intelligence , even bad are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , together with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized this , that it &apos;s a slightly different .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
it was three .  (809)
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him look .  (810)
but as a home for a second child , his care suddenly sort of a lot .  (811)
and he also run in , and then the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck are born with the duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , obviously , but he was one of them .  (812)
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons .  (813)
it &apos;s video theme of courage and willpower and faithful ?  (814)
also , or 卢克 joins the army remove the fact that the government ?  (815)
&quot; 绿野 一下1939年 contrast 仙 tracking . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is how to win ?  (817)
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders .  (818)
and i hope to their kids in this environment -- oz world -- up , and not to beat up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality .  (819)
why do we give children have so many movies , violence , so little yellow brick way ?  (820)
for women &apos;s film about men &apos;s violence impact , a lot of good analysis , you should look at articles written . good .  (821)
the atmosphere for boys impact , i read the article not that much .  (822)
and my own experience , 从莱娅 , what about the environment guide me not to get to experience in real life , adult world adults to children into the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; 混居 men and women .  (823)
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the end of the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i do a mission , won 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be standing here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 .  (829)
and of course , the example is a lot , and i would in front of you for disney princess are defense .  (830)
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not these films this audience .  (831)
these films , there &apos;s a big a all because it &apos;s taught how girls against 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society .  (832)
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 .  (833)
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i &apos;m going to all of you recommend this film . now are being shown in .  (836)
you remember the brave legends of criticism , &quot; just project ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 and started to do the movies . &quot;  (838)
that &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , almost all of these films , not by &quot; 贝克德 test . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
this test for people who don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do about them .  (842)
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her , and a friend in and they saw the movie about content .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)
think about the standard .  (845)
if , female characters in movies , to do that ?  (846)
if you have to , with their common 心上人 talk about content ?  (847)
okay ? thank you .  (848)
thank you very much .  (849)
two women , to have to speak , there .  (850)
it &apos;s this movie . i &apos;ve seen in , but we &apos;ve seen , and like the film is very rare .  (851)
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen quality a nice movie 阿尔戈 . &quot;  (852)
oscar for the movie , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality .  (853)

this is going to be like him from 成年期 waiting for the first encounter .  (912)
and he was in the same story with different center in the world .  (913)
this is a story about taken from the power of the city , the story of the young unemployed . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 started riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out .  (914)
for young people , cities with dreams 大城市 to work , it means opportunities , wealth , but not to enjoy their young people in the city .  (915)
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment .  (916)
in 2030 , five people living in cities , there &apos;s three is under 18 to people .  (917)
if we in urban development , not to young people . think about , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and gang 雷池 these will be the future of cities .  (918)
i was born in the city &apos;s 加迪休 , 70 percent of the people in unemployment .  (919)
70 percent didn &apos;t work didn &apos;t read books .  (920)
basically do nothing  (921)
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital .  (922)
i remember standing in the eye hospital was full of play in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it be ?  (923)
if i get to in the same 成年期 waiting for ?  (924)
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ?  (925)
and i did say no .  (926)
last month , i actually 加迪休 &apos;s back to the reason is to have a young leadership and entrepreneurship learn summit  (927)
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership  (928)
we sat down and working together to solution cities are the biggest problem .  (929)
one of the room aden called the young people .  (930)
he &apos;s 加迪休 in the university and graduated .  (931)
there was no job , nothing .  (932)
i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work very frustrated , is &quot; the party &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit .  (933)
the people that look like this .  (934)
but the story , it &apos;s another version  (935)
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and the biggest hurdle is the  (936)
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and it actually , it became the easy-to-use tools .  (937)
aden find opportunities and grab it on .  (938)
he built a motorcycle company .  (939)
started a motorcycle cab to the people who couldn &apos;t afford motorcycle  (940)
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years spread 数百辆  (941)
he &apos;s the story of how different ?  (942)
what makes the difference ?  (943)
i believe , is he going to find opportunities and opportunity .  (944)
this is entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is about 成年期 waiting for the most effective tool .  (945)
he drove young people as they had been crazy in search of economic opportunity makers  (946)
you can get trained to young people .  (947)
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a meeting , he called mohamed mohamoud 名花 is a business .  (948)
he was trained in business to help me on the summit of young people train them how to create entrepreneurial innovation .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; what is the last time you see ? &quot; flowers , civil war was born in time for many of them will be the answer is , &quot; never seen before . &quot;  (950)
so from that mohamed opportunities .  (951)
he started a 园林 greening and companies and design .  (952)
he &apos;s in agriculture 加迪休 go out on a tulip 百合花 and he started to grow , and he said that can take a bad climate 加迪休 &apos;s .  (953)
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in town , business and busy . now he &apos;s busy 22年 加迪休 &apos;s built the first citizens park .  (954)
now , there &apos;s no citizens 加迪休 &apos;s in park .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for young people , can family together here like he said , to feel and inspire 花香 rose .  (956)
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep .  (958)
they don &apos;t want to business .  (959)
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he of innovation , for those people very big .  (960)
he makes those young people with the opportunity to reframe the city  (961)
he makes they believe they can also be entrepreneurs can also be changing the world .  (962)
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now .  (963)
they came up with a business solution to local problems .  (964)
so that young people creating companies culture is big step across , but people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business  (966)
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them from idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for cities  (967)
for me , entrepreneurship is not just open business  (968)
it also create social impact .  (969)
it &apos;s not just sold in doctor-heroes  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , it will be truly change people to the city .  (972)
on the side of the street aden hired to help him a cab to help him and maintain the motorcycle  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to escape from was to get 成年期 wait .  (974)
these young entrepreneurs , all of them have a profound impact cities .  (975)
so my suggestion is that move more young people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more flowers and peace , and the story of the park , there &apos;s not that car bomb and 成年期 waiting for the story .  (976)
thank you .  (977)
薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read the chinese word for .  (978)
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , me , one of the most precious memory is a mother and i showed the chinese word for the beauty of form of care .  (979)
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language .  (980)
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to china as 高不可攀 wall .  (981)
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how to tackle this wall , and that to understand and look at this complex language elegant , where people can do this .  (982)
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way , to learn the chinese word for .  (983)
from five up , i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book .  (984)
fifteen years time , i learn new the chinese word for every day .  (985)
because we are only five minutes time , should have a much more easy faster way of learning .  (986)
a chinese scholar 二万个 that the chinese word for .  (987)
you just need to know the chinese word for a thousand , can read simple literature .  (988)
the chinese word for that top 二百个 , and you see it -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read sign , to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content .  (989)
today i use the chinese word for eight to show you how this works .  (990)
you ready ?  (991)
put your mouth is to get bigger , the better , until a square .  (992)
this is a &quot; and &quot; words .  (993)
this is a person who is in walking .  (994)
&quot; one word . &quot;  (995)
this is a tree .  (996)
&quot; carpenter . &quot;  (997)
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot;  (998)
&quot; day . &quot;  (999)
&quot; months . &quot;  (1000)
&quot; 門 &quot; signs like wild about comfort in cars on a door .  (1001)
i call this eight words for basic words .  (1002)
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words .  (1003)
a &quot; people . &quot;  (1004)
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot;  (1005)
there is a saying that , two , three people to get from people for public .  (1006)
if somebody open arms , and people said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot;  (1007)
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; in , the people were stuck .  (1008)
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about it being trapped in a whale in .  (1009)
that &apos;s a tree . &quot; &quot; carpenter &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot;  (1010)
three trees together , is &quot; forest . &quot;  (1011)
put a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot;  (1012)
to put a 张嘴 on a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot;  (1013)
remember to very easy , because trees are going to speak a very 呆傻 things .  (1014)
remember &quot; fire &quot; ?  (1015)
两团 &quot; fire &quot; together , it becomes very hot , &quot; &quot; .  (1016)
三团 &quot; fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much .  (1017)
to put the fire &apos;s two trees , &quot; burn . &quot;  (1018)
for us , the sun is all sources of life .  (1019)
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around .  (1020)
the three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot;  (1021)
when the sun and the moon these together , and that &apos;s &quot; the light . &quot;  (1022)
one day after a night , is &quot; tomorrow . &quot;  (1023)
and on the horizon , from the sun rises . &quot; 旦 . &quot;  (1024)
a &quot; door . &quot; and put the block of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot;  (1025)
to put a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot;  (1026)
&quot; bang , bang , &quot; people in the home ?  (1027)
this was even outside , &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; escape . &quot;  (1028)
on the left , we have a woman .  (1029)
two women together , maybe have debate .  (1030)
three women together , be careful , which is -- &quot; 姦 . &quot;  (1031)
we &apos;ve learned about the chinese word for 30 .  (1032)
and through this way , this eight basic words can secondary out into 32 the chinese word for .  (1033)
the next eight , the chinese word for a secondary out and the chinese word for 32 .  (1034)
so , you can easy to learn hundreds of the chinese word for eight years old , this is the chinese children of chinese language .  (1035)
these words in school later , we started learning how to build a phrase .  (1036)
for example , take &quot; the &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcano . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot;  (1037)
we know that japan is the sun rises place .  (1038)
here to the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china .  (1039)
so to the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot;  (1040)
in &quot; the japanese &quot; put a &quot; people , we get what ? &quot;  (1041)
&quot; the japanese . &quot;  (1042)
the words are stacking up and down the mountain , those two together .  (1043)
in the ancient chinese 流亡 , which means , because china clothes 政敌 put in to the mountain .  (1044)
today , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go out . &quot;  (1045)
&quot; and &quot; a word tell you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot;  (1046)
this slide , it reminds me of the talk , and walking down the table . thank you .  (1047)
