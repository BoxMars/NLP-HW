meg jay : why 30 is not new 20 .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need psychiatric patient treatments .  (2)
when i was in college berkeley read a clinical psychologist . they 3d students .  (3)
she was a woman named alex 26 .  (4)
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and the slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in my office , sit directly to the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she &apos;s going to tell me about the men .  (5)
when i heard this , and i disengaged .  (6)
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so i have 一个二十几岁 people i want to talk about boys .  (8)
i thought i could manage this thing .  (9)
but i can &apos;t do that .  (10)
alex in every meeting , will bring funny story , so to me , and the first 点点 on the results of the time is a really easy thing .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is the new , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
in order to have to work , marry later , in order to have to have children , even after death is to have .  (13)
like alex like me who is 二十几岁 except for nothing outside .  (14)
but not too long , i started to push it on my 催 alex love life .  (15)
i said no .  (16)
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next one of these people getting married .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists call &quot; and it turns out that ! &quot; moment .  (20)
and in that moment , i learned that 30 is not new 二十岁 .  (21)
yeah , people more than ever late 安顿 down , but that doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between her development 低谷 .  (22)
this makes alex 二十几岁 developed a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there kill it .  (23)
and i realized that this &quot; kindness oversight &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love for life around people 二十几岁 family and the future .  (24)
now , the united states has about 5千万 二十几岁 people .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think about that nobody can experience in this phase 二十几岁 case went through adults .  (26)
if you &apos;re 二十几岁 , take a hand .  (27)
i really wanted to see there 一些二十几岁 people .  (28)
that &apos;s great ! you &apos;re awesome .  (29)
if you work with 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people and o failed , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people are very important .  (30)
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human lifetime 80 percent of the most important moment occurred in 35 years old .  (32)
that means every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with &quot; ! &quot; moment of that . there are eight happened in 30 中旬 .  (33)
over 40 years , people don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money you &apos;re going to make a very big impact .  (36)
we know more than half of america before the 30 and mate 终生 married , 同居 , or on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain when 二十几岁 to adapt to the second time period as adults are the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own what , now is to change its time .  (38)
we know life than other stages 二十岁 , some of the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do .  (39)
so your 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body and the choice is the future of the time .  (40)
so when we talk about children &apos;s development five years ago , we all know the language of brain development and admiration critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact period of time .  (42)
but we &apos;ve heard a little there &apos;s a thing called adult development , and our 二十岁 this stage is the critical period for adults development .  (43)
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
researchers have called 二十几岁 extending adolescence .  (46)
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid names , like , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , we get is actually adult 期中 known as the most important decades doesn &apos;t matter .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time .  (50)
this is not right ?  (51)
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ?  (52)
doesn &apos;t happen .  (53)
you take that guy and urgency worked , but nothing happening .  (54)
or &quot; everyone said , &quot; well , if i just before the 30 started my career , that &apos;s fine . &quot; this kind of thing .  (55)
but then they start talking about , &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have the show .  (56)
i graduated from the best day 写写 my résumé . &quot;  (57)
and then they start talking about , &quot; when 二十几岁 date as a seat in games .  (58)
you &apos;re running around , and , in the middle of it , but to about 30 music will stop off a after another , you start to sit down .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &quot; chair &quot; . &quot;  (60)
and the 二十几岁 people out there ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
well , you hear that may seem a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , and very high currency .  (63)
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure .  (64)
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and start looking like that , in this phase 三十几岁 and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
in the middle of a thousand years after the crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy .  (66)
that is not my job is that they want .  (67)
that is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or can &apos;t give their children a long .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people to do what we think .  (69)
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do .  (70)
this is a about a woman called emma story .  (71)
when emma 25 , because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at .  (73)
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she showed that worked 脾气 more and more than any at all live together .  (74)
and no matter how hard it is her 二十几岁 , her life was much more difficult .  (75)
she was meeting , crying , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she bought a new address thin , and she took her to fill a morning people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this a ... &quot; &quot; the blank behind .  (78)
she almost 歇斯底里 of looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
and i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot;  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make a decision that emma for 10 years pass by it off .  (84)
so in the next weeks and months , i taught in every three emma 二十几岁 people , both men and women are , should hear things .  (85)
first of all , i tell emma forget her identity crisis then accumulate identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value .  (87)
do you think about this , what &apos;s going to be investment .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma professional future , and nobody knows the future of our work , but i know that these : identity capital will to do more identity capital .  (89)
and that is to be a professional multinational , in that space , and you want to step up to the time .  (90)
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to tell you cannot called exploration .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count .  (93)
secondly , i tell emma tribes , cities overestimate .  (94)
the new capital , the new can get almost always about people from the inside of the external communities .  (95)
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends .  (96)
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment .  (97)
but half is not that connection is weak , and put yourself in a group that way .  (98)
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and reach your neighbor &apos;s boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 working methods .  (99)
it &apos;s not cheating . this is information about how to deliver science .  (100)
and finally , emma that people don &apos;t choose a family , but can choose friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people &apos;s emma , soon to pass and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family .  (102)
i tell emma choice family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a 30 than 20 , 25 is even better off of the time , and i agreed .  (104)
but when you start getting married in other people into the auditorium , and you manage your 同居 or sleep people don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
in &apos;s marriage kung fu and the best time is married before , which means love is like to do with the work of consciousness .  (106)
choice family is conscious choices that you want to people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose your that people wasted time .  (107)
and how that emma ?  (108)
well , and it turns out that address thin , and she found her a roommate had a family in another in an art museum work .  (109)
the faint . she was there for a job .  (110)
and that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons .  (111)
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners .  (112)
she and her a consciously chose people get married .  (113)
she loved her new career , she loved his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emerging 联系人 behind a big enough to . &quot; 的卡 pieces .  (114)
emma story that &apos;s something that sounds very simple , but that &apos;s what i love and 二十几岁 people that work .  (115)
it &apos;s so easy to help them .  (116)
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport go somewhere in the west flights .  (117)
and the fly , a little challenging is further and further in alaska in fiji difference .  (118)
likewise , or even in 21 25 29岁 , it &apos;s a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 and even a few generations have a very big impact .  (119)
this gives a worth spreading , you know , for every 二十几岁 one idea .  (120)
it and i learned to say to alex as simple .  (121)
don &apos;t get you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition .  (122)
now , you &apos;re in determines your life .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
李镇河 : 李镇河 into the computer : &quot; real world , you play &quot; infinite imagination .  (125)
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s our real world and the gap between the virtual world , in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , which is a touchscreen glass that thin , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there .  (127)
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world borders between the good ?  (128)
so i started to try this crazy idea .  (129)
i first made that tool , it can number into space , if you take this with a pen that force on the screen , and lots of a pen and goes into a little pixels of virtual worlds .  (130)
designers directly in three-dimensional space for their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery .  (131)
so , this is a tool that broke the virtual and real world of boundaries .  (132)
but we still hands on the screen .  (133)
how can we reach into and digital information to have interaction , we have to use my hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space to work in the least numbers .  (135)
because window file in real time and space have a particular location , pick it becomes like a book with shelves from so easily .  (136)
and you can read this book , and in every window floating and virtual touch board out across words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands or stretched rotate all sorts of things .  (138)
in this case , that we &apos;re now entering the digital world .  (139)
but how can transform it to get the role of digital information into our world ?  (140)
that many people here have online shopping and 退货 experience .  (141)
but now than you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because i , there &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 in line .  (143)
this is the system we analyzed the physical features , geometry , through your head of driving , or a way to look at that show us all .  (144)
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make our space these visible pixels little switch to actually get to touch , feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve 雷米 persian , make it in a matter of &quot; pixels . &quot;  (147)
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 as we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and people will move the object in that three-dimensional space 一三维 little any place .  (148)
our basic principles , it &apos;s the gravity pellets for work , and it &apos;s magnetically levitated mechanical drive and goes into a combination of technology to control pellets movement .  (149)
by the number of programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , you can move in a physical world can be recorded , back and forever , keep .  (150)
so , dance 编排 can be remote and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action can over and over and over again , to actually be repeated itself .  (151)
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force .  (152)
more exciting is that this is not the computer put things into a real matter , it &apos;s starting to imagine programming world , and we &apos;re going to change a regular physical activity .  (153)
and as you can see , digital information will not take things for us , but that &apos;s going to start working on us directly into our physical environment , not cut part of our connection to reality .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we could remove the border , the rest of us are enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)

but there was a big people love that idea .  (168)
not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious .  (169)
there &apos;s only my 小伙伴 them for me , but they also a child , and i did powerless .  (170)

my dream is no longer going to do .  (172)
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness .  (173)
injustice ah ! my god .  (174)
i decided to our search for dark another mission .  (175)
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal .  (176)
i learned from the book .  (177)
&#91; &quot; 三毛 全集 &quot; and &quot; 南怀瑾 historical experience . &quot; i 1995 , to the united states in the united states , what i first read a book ?  (178)
of course , is that the chinese 禁书 .  (179)
the earth about &quot; is china farmers .  (180)
you &apos;re not really convenient propaganda . okay .  (181)
bible is quite interesting , but also very strange .  (182)
the topic 他日 talk again .  (183)
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot;  (184)
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; that &apos;s not and more than &quot; submission . &quot;  (185)
it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool , it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool to rebuild , my relationship with their parents .  (186)
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from a big to use a world map .  (189)
i &apos;ve never realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily need to map in the world .  (190)
it turns out that maps with a view .  (191)
compare reading is not new .  (192)
it &apos;s academia standards in practice .  (193)
比较文学 , even more religion being studied field of religion . 比较文学 , even become specialized research .  (194)
compared to control scholars for a project has a full understanding . contrast to control scholars for a project has a full understanding .  (195)
i wonder , and that &apos;s reading on useful , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ?  (196)
so i started putting a book about to read .  (197)
they can be about the same event , different parties , they can be about the same event , different parties , or two friends have shared experience .  (198)
what is the experience of economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation .  (199)
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desires and fear and social responsibility -- interesting .  (200)
if you understand the language , put your book like two language . but it was very interesting .  (201)
so thomas 默 translation . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 watts , &quot; the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost one , i was discovered that translation can lead to harvest .  (202)
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning it &apos;s called &quot; quick joy , &quot; well ...  (203)
&quot; bride chinese word for the literal meaning &quot; it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god !  (204)
and i had become 今人 communicate with an amazing discovery , portal book because i had become with 今人 communication , a magic .  (205)
let me just don &apos;t feel helpless alone .  (206)
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 anything .  (207)
i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose .  (208)
it &apos;s the most important for our goal is to touch the dream sources of places where the source , passion , happiness sources of places .  (209)
even a broken 灭 dreams can get your experiencing that touch .  (210)
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , live happily , life of purpose and meaning to become clear , in most of the time .  (211)
and hope and never will you at any age .  (212)
thank you .  (213)
thank you .  (214)
thank you .  (215)

well , it &apos;s all a .  (224)
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other students are high score to awfully !  (225)
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all the way that nothing but and creativity  (226)
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line , because i &apos;ve been in it , more to do something completely  (227)
now i don &apos;t understand my behavior .  (228)
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out .  (229)
i don &apos;t know why it &apos;s wonderful to do that .  (230)
i was feeling great .  (231)
i don &apos;t know why i had never been found  (232)
i mean , this thing to do so .  (233)

i knew primates envy , blue 知更鸟 very comfortable envy  (239)
we know the envy spouses murder agents .  (240)
but i never read an research could explain , &quot; &quot; envy lonely it is a long time , or the brutal .  (241)
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s possible .  (242)
well , i don &apos;t know it &apos;s not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have a literary ?  (243)

these books , in virginia 伍尔夫 seems like a cat gut .  (255)
i don &apos;t know what the cat , but we can suppose it as 坚 顽石 .  (256)
let &apos;s look at these things come together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and jealous 普鲁斯 , with envy .  (257)
妒忌 up to people , and from that desire to become a firm foundation narrative is not very obvious ?  (258)
i don &apos;t know . i think it profoundly push our sensitive nerve because just think about when we get jealous , what happens .  (259)
when we get jealous , when we &apos;re going to make a story .  (260)
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they were just to let the &apos;d suffered .  (261)

you know , there were my boyfriend 普鲁斯 . if you want to tell him that 分手 to escape from this country .  (267)
but you don &apos;t need so envy will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ?  (268)
let &apos;s body 疲 its time .  (269)
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , have to get .  (270)

she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ?  (294)
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard .  (295)
fiction writing about this very well .  (296)
it &apos;s very good at novel about how we see training pitch , but it &apos;s not a gets it right .  (297)
well , we get jealous of the strong , we &apos;re going to more often .  (298)
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do things violent or illegal .  (299)
envy causes our behavior becomes extreme .  (300)
i admit that i got was eight years old . but i also see on the news came up with a story .  (301)
michigan women 一个52岁 discovered a registered fake facebook account and use that accounts for their year sending out the malicious news .  (302)
a year . for one year .  (303)
she &apos;s trying to her 陷害 before the aisles girlfriend now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her .  (304)
because , i want to say , you face reality .  (305)
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , right ?  (306)
this comes from fiction .  (307)
a pie 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel .  (308)
i really love is 海史密斯 writers .  (309)
she &apos;s in the united states 文学史 brilliant and 诡 one page .  (310)
for example , tom , but in her case , the most famous .  (311)
里普利 started to you or want what you have , then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in his basement 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account .  (312)
this is a road .  (313)
but we do ? we cannot repeat 里普利 .  (314)
i can &apos;t tell the world has dramatically , even if i would one day be able to do this .  (315)
and unfortunately , because we live in admire times .  (316)
we live in envy .  (317)
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , right ?  (318)
it can give us a novel solution ? i &apos;m not sure  (319)
so we &apos;re going to 学学 fictional characters , you see they &apos;re kind of puzzles , when things don &apos;t know how to do .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to 贝克街 221 夏洛克 de 福尔摩斯 ask the b .  (321)
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would want to his adversaries 里亚蒂 professor -- this genius .  (322)
but i &apos;ve always liked to a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face a scottish 头子 he really needed to 福尔摩斯 his intelligence , but hate him .  (323)
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this .  (324)
he &apos;s 垂 雷斯 needed help , and he hated the secret of the cases 侦破 always and 苦闷 story .  (325)
we proud of you . &quot;  (326)
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold 福尔摩斯 .  (327)
this is what we saw 少数几次 福尔摩斯 in the human being moved , and when i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it &apos;s like having as a geometry , instead of emotions .  (329)
this one minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand in the same .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he used to hate .  (332)
but what &apos;s so simple ?  (333)
if it &apos;s a geometric problem to do , a about how we choose your relationship with other questions ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate somebody talent .  (335)
we &apos;ll chase .  (336)
but i love contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment , here we have to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
it has been going on with envy fiction  (339)
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it now .  (340)
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy a million and a 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there .  (341)
we have so good .  (342)
thank you .  (343)
ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash .  (344)
so i was 10 , and once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a in the new york in the zone .  (345)
it was really good weather .  (346)
the forest searched twinkling lights .  (347)
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like the 晶莹 stained glass . if you don &apos;t have the little feet , we have to pretend that we &apos;re at this piece of the first human .  (348)
we eventually got to our camp .  (349)
it &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
in the back of the cliff camp , have a for about 40 feet of 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil , paper and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing .  (352)
people to camp was too lazy , even with all the ourselves up not ready . they think who would have 善后 for them ?  (353)
the problem is baffling to all the time . i became a longer sound bite .  (354)
who &apos;s going to have we leave the garbage ?  (355)
but you can take this issue on any place you live in a 伊斯坦 . we leave out the garbage ?  (356)
in rio we leave out the garbage ? in paris and london ?  (357)
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector , we have to leave the 000吨 11 , and the day of the 2000吨 recycled .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know who &apos;s doing this work .  (360)
wear sanitation trucks were parked on this up in a sense of responsibility for what ?  (361)
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project .  (362)
i was sitting in the car , and along the track , on a new york at the office workers live and work the sanitation trucks were parked . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now i &apos;m not sitting in 垃圾车 , i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 .  (366)
my own manipulate the electric its 扫帚 street , in the snow 铲 .  (367)
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process .  (368)
everyone can be asked the smell .  (369)
there &apos;s a smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad . but you &apos;ll soon will adapt .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even though there are a few years working side of worker , their bodies have adapted to try and into a week megatons of garbage .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
with the labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked work is about the most dangerous of tasks , and then you figure out why .  (374)
you all day on the road , which are of traffic .  (375)
out of the cars , thinking only , than you drive people tend to not careful .  (376)
for the sanitation trucks were parked for me , it was terrible .  (377)
and what are the full of poison , these 毒物 often from the 垃圾车 comes out , a horrible harm .  (378)
i also learned the brutal and frightening .  (379)
when you go down , 路沿 sanitation trucks were parked car in the city , you will look at a time to recognize the really like the power of nature itself .  (380)
it &apos;s never 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like breath , or a circular form .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important workforce . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient every day , and the waste from containers sort of , it will actually poison in a very real way threats to our lives .  (387)
we were attacked several hundred 和数 decade disease will again , we started to threaten our health .  (388)
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , we have no space something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consumption down .  (390)
i don &apos;t use capitalism , here i am just point out their relationship .  (391)
and the third reason -- is what i call the average , and we need to 经常性 activity speed .  (392)
i mean in today &apos;s and the old days , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , and it &apos;s clean and carried it around our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and they throw it away , and forget about them , because we know that there is a work in teams were sitting over there get those things is densest .  (395)
so today i want to suggest to you about the sanitation trucks were parked situation to help , maybe they &apos;re called . please bring them to talk about how to create a sustainable city thousands of people .  (396)
i think their work is really matters .  (397)
every time they to individual hard to work on the street .  (398)
in many cities , they &apos;re wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work .  (399)
you know they to refuse clean on time .  (400)
they are allowing us to secure in their work .  (401)
they almost became secure that work .  (402)
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and junk . this is going to work in need of stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks and 咆哮 , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing a week he 三都 do work .  (404)
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just cry up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , and again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name is 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends .  (409)
i want to believe that 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
the city , we know that the trash just actually the amount of the three percent .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so in your life every day , in your life , into the next time you see somebody and you leave out the garbage , please find a time 致意 to them .  (415)
find a time to say thank you .  (416)
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory .  (417)

bike flew 四下 go flying off from the wheel you as a rolling spoke into that corner of embarrassing .  (426)
the threshold into 门厅 in the hallway and other parts of the soft comfort .  (427)
the light on the sweet pastry monster .  (428)
he was sitting in this horse brown on the 骏马 马背 are 招手 to you .  (429)

around him around , he walked into the living room  (433)
standing in the living room your imagination to imagine appeared on the largest 小甜甜 britney  (434)
she &apos;s exposed to wear you coffee table , dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot;  (435)
and with i walked in your kitchen .  (436)
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 drill out your oven came to you is called &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking the dorothy 铁皮 people 稻草人 and lions their hands on 蹦蹦跳跳 walking arm in arm , to come to you .  (437)
okay , open your eyes .  (438)
i &apos;m going to tell you a annual spring in new york are going to have the unexpected .  (439)
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory .  (440)
a few years ago , as a journalist 科技类 this race to the part about trying to get there , like &quot; geeks who super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of men and women 屈指可数 grew up in some old boy is still don &apos;t notice personal health  (442)
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that hundreds of any of the list .  (443)
some are trying to remember the populations of strangers .  (444)
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem .  (445)
and in the game , who is the fastest way down to remember 一整副 打乱 card sequence .  (446)
and i thought that &apos;s amazing .  (447)
these people surely other talents 禀  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training .  (450)
i asked him , &quot; ed is when you start to realize their memory is genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; i &apos;m not experts .  (452)
and my memory was .  (453)
to this each one of them will tell you just average memory .  (454)
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall smart 过人 amazing and a little bit weird british josh ed said to me , &quot; you &apos;re an american journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really wanted to in the u.s. national radio taught britney on how to remember 一整副 打乱 card sequence .  (459)
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; look , i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me !  (461)
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 out in front of me .  (463)
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called e. p .  (466)
he suffers amnesia his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia is very surprising .  (468)
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can learn in which the memory of shape our personality .  (469)
this is another extreme i met somebody like this .  (470)
his name is kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; role in .  (472)
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library back to phone books , i think is just fascinating .  (473)
and i went back home and i read a lot about memory writing on the front 两千多年 article written in latin from ancient until then , during the medieval  (474)
and i learned a lot of really interesting things .  (475)
one is used to train beam may grow memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people want it to your memories could 不遗余力 to your mind .  (477)
these technologies for modern life possible , but also we change .  (478)
not only in the culture , and i think in cognitive .  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to remember that sometimes we already forgot how to memory .  (480)
in this place on earth are very few places that makes you think people still interested in training beam may grow memory the memory of a contest .  (481)
it &apos;s not that different everywhere are starting to do this .  (482)
i was obsessed with this thought , you know , how are these people do .  (483)
a few years ago london at the university of a team of researchers asked to a contest to study memory .  (484)
they want to figure out the human brain if we follow each other in structure anatomically different ?  (485)
the answer is no  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the challenges of our memory champion brain had a really interesting is very different .  (489)
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory digital or 人脸 or pattern kind , researchers found that memory champion challenges of our brain areas activated with ordinary people don &apos;t .  (490)
notice that they think , is in the brain in space and memory , it would take to navigate .  (491)
why ? what can we figure out what kind of thing ?  (492)
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective way 赛场 memory show and other people have to catch up  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there .  (494)
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 sequence card to him for an hour down with all that is a he actually invented , but only he would .  (495)
and this with the same way that he had a word , not bad back down 4140个 any alignment binary . only half an hour .  (496)
very impressive .  (497)
in these 参赛者 of competition with a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all these skills will end up going into a conceptual psychologists call a delicate code . &quot;  (498)
the concept could with a paradox of humor is perfect interpret baker / baker paradox is easy to say that i have two people to remember one word i said , &quot; if you remember a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
that &apos;s a baker .  (500)
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot;  (501)
after a while back and i asked you to remember what i call &quot; before you remember that term ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what word ? &quot;  (503)
being told is 人名 baker people remember that term potential as far as not being told a baker , the person .  (504)
the same word of different memories .  (505)
why is it ?  (506)
because 人名 baker no special .  (507)
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any .  (508)
but baker used it as a noun that we all know baker &apos;s .  (509)
baker with funny white cap .  (510)
they hand and flour .  (511)
they came home from work with 扑鼻 a toast .  (512)
maybe some people have friends are baker  (513)
we first hear this word , immediately generates all kinds of ways that we can make in after a while , can still remember .  (514)
this precise memory 两千五百年 skills in front of the ancient greeks had it .  (515)
and call it palace .  (516)
developed this technique is one called simonides following the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he &apos;s been asked to do the performing guest because in the &apos; cool fancy party . it &apos;s not just d. j. to beat reduction , but please poet ode to come .  (518)
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died .  (519)
not all death all dead were to come down on 面目全非  (520)
no one said to them what are some people who don &apos;t like to tell who sat where  (521)
that causes the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬  (522)
and then this reinforce the whole thing color tragedy .  (523)
simonides as standing outside the rubble only survivor close your eyes to realize is thrust upon in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 can sit .  (524)
he would hold hands are relative to the site and they brought up to us .  (525)
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 thing about all of you have probably guessed . it &apos;s no matter how much we are not remember name phone number or colleagues every instructions that we all have very keen visual or space memory capacity .  (526)
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i &apos;ve been telling stories simonides 10 years ago , &quot; should not some people will remember .  (527)
but i bet you now , if i put down your back in the foyer . sat will speak brown on 骏马 who is that you see , i just saying .  (528)
this advice from the latin 两千多年 before the first scholars memory .  (529)
so this phrase principles of what ?  (530)
suppose you were invited to stand on the ted stage , and you want to talk to 脱稿 as 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome tedx talk on and so he &apos;ll 霸气 step one and you want .  (531)
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their  (532)
and imagine working out with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster ed mr. sitting on the back .  (534)
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook .  (535)
and then you have a mind britney 小甜甜 . you &apos;ll remember to talk about britney that little story .  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topics are you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association  (537)
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just be the only reciting 添麻烦 but remember , one by one .  (538)
it &apos;s the theme &quot; phrase &quot; is from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is 古时候 people talk about , or a rhetorical took place .  (540)
&quot; the phrase &quot; means your memory 第一层 palace .  (541)
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that a lot of interest .  (542)
and then i went to more memory .  (543)
i started to more detailed 萌发 . it &apos;s that the memory of my culture .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory process is very boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there .  (547)
very exciting moment don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had written a bit !  (549)
i know that these people in your mind must be 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see as 外人  (550)
i realized that if i really think about these things have to have to experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes to do something .  (552)
there &apos;s little back .  (553)
back in my back 跳蚤市场 bought in 年鉴 old people .  (554)
i was surprised to find it very 带劲  (555)
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise  (556)
it &apos;s goal is not to train memory .  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working to create the myth is hopefully very funny 胡乱 unforgettable images .  (558)
and it became my joy .  (559)
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a whole 镜面 护目镜 耳塞 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the largest attention that is the enemy .  (561)
and i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 .  (562)
i also want to drive a signed up to participate in the news was that as an experiment .  (563)
i thought to be , in the 前言 调侃 it yourself .  (564)
the problem is experiment finally got unexpected consequences  (565)
i won the competition . it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important .  (567)
these are little usual tricks  (568)
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles .  (569)
don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember 几副 sequence of the cards and you can actually learn from the brain does have some benefits .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 it is not .  (571)
powerful memory is can acquire .  (572)
from the fundamental 专心致志 can keep talking about .  (573)
engaged , can remember  (574)
memory palace or that memory skills are just 捷径 .  (575)
and they really can &apos;t be 捷径  (576)
this work is because it forces you to think about  (577)
it forces you to go deeper , to want more you focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to this training .  (578)
and 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist .  (579)
this is what we have to remember things .  (580)
let me find my experience in our bodies 潜藏 with incredible memory capacity .  (581)
but if you want to live memorable do is to remember that a lot of people .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
and who lee duke 沃斯 : success ? willpower .  (584)
on my 27th , and i left a very challenging -- a professional management consulting company , turn it into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i came to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math .  (586)
and the other teachers , i &apos;ll give students do little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
when these 试卷 homework and open up , and then i calculate their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq , the ups are not my best and the worst between the only difference .  (590)
some in the 课业 did quite well students don &apos;t have very high iq score on .  (591)
some very smart kids , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 .  (592)
this got me thinking .  (593)
of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like , a little rates , parallel computation 四边形 area .  (594)
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbooks content , as long as they would spend time and effort .  (595)
after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in terms of education , we need to learn from the dynamic perspective and psychological level , the students and learning . take a more profound understanding .  (596)
in education systems , we all know evaluating students a standard is iq , but if you &apos;re in schools and the good life do not just as easily efficient depend on your ability to learn ?  (597)
all i left the stage , back to school and entered psychology master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids and adults are , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and in a study where , in my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they succeeding ?  (599)
i and my research group 西点 point to do research .  (600)
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out .  (601)
we see the first to build a word , but also try to anticipate what kids can level-up in the end game .  (602)
we study in hostile environment for work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students .  (603)
we work with 私企 , to ask them what sales people can stay in .  (604)
what can the more money ?  (605)
in all these different context , a character that no one out of the characteristics , largely predicted success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
it &apos;s not nice appearance , robust . and it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on .  (610)
tenacity is have perpetual 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is you for the future , with every day is not just for a week or a month , but a few years , and for decades trying to make their dream a reality .  (612)
tenacity is put life as a marathon , it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in the public school , i started studying willpower .  (614)
i said to the 初中生 千名 conducted a survey of about willpower , and waiting for more than a year , to see what ultimately to graduate students .  (615)
everything is not just in 西点 point or in the competition to build the words that willpower in school . this is also , especially for those in the dropout 徘徊 children .  (616)
for my own self , about tenacity me the most incredible things , tenacity is heading for us to develop willpower , cognitive science in understanding how much was poor .  (617)
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ?  (619)
and what they move the long-term is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t going to give you gritty heart .  (622)
our data suggests that very clearly , there are many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , according to our data rates , usually willpower with other factors , it has nothing to do with the brilliance measures run counter .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard in children , raise quality tough most effective called &quot; growth model for thinking . &quot;  (625)
stanford 卡洛杜 william , with a view , and he believed that the human learning can change it , as you try to measure the change .  (626)
professor 杜威克 means , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain and its facing challenges , what was happening and growing situation , after they fail more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure .  (627)
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
i decided at the end of my comments , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
this is what &apos;s in front of a job .  (631)
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice .  (632)
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in back again .  (633)
in other words , we just have to become more tenacity to allow our children to become more willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
泽维尔 dimensions , that the : into local culture .  (636)
as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , and to think about , building around with the environment , and with the buildings , around the environment , which is the relationship between tradition .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea .  (638)
these two examples are emerging in a country , in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
these two examples , one thing in common is that design solutions and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping malls .  (641)
this is what i and my team at the same for example , we were asked to design this way .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
look at the same in this kind of architecture , the city -- it &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we found that the most important three questions .  (644)
first , the building is basically empty , because they are in large store , people who are not big brands .  (645)
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because the roads are built outside of glass , this design would be trapped inside heat in architecture , it leads to what we need a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this city climate is very 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. .  (647)
the third problem is the building looks like one african or ethiopia didn &apos;t matter .  (648)
for a culture and abundance 底蕴 city , it &apos;s called us down .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , when i was a local 集贸市场 was mesmerized . . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the outside environment , from 小商贩 in various to buy products .  (650)
that is compatible with my ideas , is in outdoor public setting the idea of creating activities .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the question is , how can we in such a contemporary architecture 贯彻 多层 of these ideas ?  (653)
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapidly growing city in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , are we designing doesn &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building on the context of two parallel in the street , and there are no 几百米 little can connected .  (655)
so we need to do is we use all of this very building a portal , to connect these two way up .  (656)
and we have a gradient of design 庭 , created an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 .  (657)
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and different .  (658)
i think , the question is , the buildings outside walls are decorated ?  (659)
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment .  (660)
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole made out of cement , to be able to use a controlled by the way , and the light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we from ethiopia beautiful women on the pattern of traditional dress got inspiration .  (662)
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls .  (663)
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and by the way we manage to buildings .  (664)
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night .  (665)
these ideas , but we don &apos;t start building moved , and they react to things like , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all know , this design solutions to than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop .  (667)
and this the design of the wall , a ton of lowering cost , not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of the air conditioning to control .  (668)
and eventually , we have saved an part budget .  (669)
where is the first question is , how do we make sure that the building in power , because we live in cities -- almost every day pushing 闸 electricity .  (670)
so we were on the roof of the solar panels .  (671)
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in the solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , to be here in cities , oasis 小憩 for people .  (672)
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the interior of clean .  (673)
we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , well .  (674)
the second example for the tunisian town planning a more than a 2000套 apartment buildings and collateral infrastructure .  (675)
to scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i only need was really understand the tunisian city , and she also need to understand these kinds of tradition and culture .  (676)
and in the process , i kind of being a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a has over thousands of years of history , its structure brick wall , there are 12 相互之间 through the door , almost straight to the road .  (677)
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 primary small region in size and all the characteristics we kind of in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning .  (678)
in these blocks planning basis , referenced mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , changes in the beginning of the model .  (679)
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , like a cubicle , is that this poses a fundamental part of planning .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is facing the best ?  (681)
and the answer is , can use to 南北朝 house 南北 on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we do this kind of model for all the apartments , have perfect towards .  (683)
this is the effect , we designed like an arab town , combined with style , european style residential together .  (684)
some of the building areas with garden , and walk around on the ground to the full connection .  (685)
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 population density of high , the population density is not very expensive .  (686)
and she &apos;s right up to our entry even between 通性 demand .  (687)
this is the roof of the project i 得意 part , it &apos;s like to be these buildings takes up space and back to the community .  (688)
the community can climb roof , and talk to each other poke somebody , god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or on the back and forth between jump .  (689)
and there are two examples , in the design process took the same way .  (690)
again , they are emerging in cities , you can see the little 拔地而起 building material .  (691)
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate .  (692)
for this reason , i think about the architectural design , the more important in between , which is , searching for simple solutions , and cheap enough to enhance and promote the local people and civic relationship , and to give you good close to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . at first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said to the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche .  (697)
i think there are three things like that .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus .  (699)
the second one is : what we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task .  (701)
i think people to use this task , and it has the wrong way .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , and it has a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing .  (706)
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls polls , to find out about 信任感 in decline .  (708)
but when you really look at different times polls , actually , not many evidence supporting this idea .  (709)
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and mainly politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and 20 years ago is highly trust people like that , and the nurse , still get altitude of trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in the society 居中 people , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
poll records , of course , is that some people .  (714)
or you can record polls ?  (715)
but it &apos;s a general attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;re talking about .  (716)
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ?  (717)
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
you sell fish trust ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart you ask .  (722)
when you understand what the problem is , what would you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot;  (723)
a very rational answer .  (724)
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways for trust .  (725)
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types analyze it . the official civil servant , etc . , it will be types .  (726)
for example , i would say , &quot; i believe , of course , i know a primary school math teacher will teach them how to read . but i don &apos;t believe that she can run bus .  (727)
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers .  (728)
i might believe that i love drinking friend &apos;s friends chatting . but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them , he &apos;s a secret to live .  (729)
that &apos;s it .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence that there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 , so why poll , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ?  (731)
i think poll was a very bad measure 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to consider 信任感 poor judgment .  (732)
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ?  (733)
that &apos;s what we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think this is pretty funny .  (735)
i think it &apos;s not the purpose .  (736)
i would say , they deserve to be trusted more to trust , and not to trust not trusted people .  (737)
in fact , i mean , it was trying not to trust not trusted people .  (738)
for example , who have yourself to earn that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money roll out 麦道 夫 sir , you know , i think these people , yeah ? i mean , right , so easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
and very clever to trust to choose not to trust that &apos;s the purpose .  (741)
so some people say , well , ok , this is not the most important not to trust , instead of credibility ?  (742)
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy .  (743)
i think right to make decisions about three to consider .  (744)
they want to see whether or not ? it allows you to be honest , whether reliable ?  (745)
if we think that one allows you to be , in his field allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe they , because they &apos;re reliable .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not with them to help me to send messages , because they &apos;re forget .  (748)
i got some very confident friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident .  (749)
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to be reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest .  (750)
maybe one , i &apos;ve never found .  (751)
we need is before : trust to look at his reputation reliability .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do .  (754)
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions in institutions , whether accountability needs to be a professional level or official asked these and making it easier for us to determine whether there was a reputation .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that .  (757)
and i remember i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a than 手续 接生 a children &apos;s hard . &quot;  (758)
in our public life , our institutions in life , we find a lot of questions . the institution of the accountability for these rules to protect his reputation as can be trusted by institutions to see it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
it allows people to focus their work , like they 助产士 , let them take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually had that experience .  (761)
on purpose to talk about a lot .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , an attitude , there are not talking about it .  (763)
and thirdly , about the task .  (764)
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got a little .  (765)
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust .  (766)
well , we can do it for yourself .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but what &apos;s the matter , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from each other .  (770)
you can &apos;t fix people say to you .  (771)
you need to make people trying to get you any 家信 .  (772)
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people .  (773)
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful , according to let them know that you are trustworthy .  (775)
how to do that ?  (776)
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work ?  (777)
i give you just a simple , for example , marketing .  (778)
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions .  (779)
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me change color is my favorite socks .  (780)
that &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me feel like they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very well be trusted . according to say to yourself , you have confidence .  (783)
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell .  (784)
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
john 科林 托克斯 : the movies manhood .  (787)
as the father made me happy , is they like to see the film .  (788)
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , together , we saw the 仙 绿野 spaces . &quot;  (789)
and then a few months , she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 .  (791)
and she put yourself in the same look like 仙女 was holding 魔杖 .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll find this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , raise kids , kids are getting immersed in a fantastic complexity of the world .  (794)
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot;  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
this is a trend for 40 years later today to pop . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 and a guy 毛绒绒 to mimic the enemy to safeguard save a girl .  (797)
you know that this is what movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different , &quot; 绿野 仙 spaces like &quot; recent years we see all the film in 两三 ways , there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients .  (801)
it &apos;s actually a nasty , like , for instance .  (802)
but i think if we are tracking 仙 绿野 film , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of people .  (803)
use your magic to beat slippers bad 巫婆 military . &quot;  (804)
but it &apos;s not like that .  (805)
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; sex and unique into image of the most heroic , intelligence , or bad people are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; together , realizing that point , and it was a little different .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
it was three .  (809)
he was too small , so we don &apos;t see his name .  (810)
but as a second child , his family to take care of it all sort of a lot .  (811)
and he also run in , and then in the mystery is like a little duck were seen as duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this film . but he clearly i became obsessed with this .  (812)
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons .  (813)
a subject that film out of courage , tenacity and faithful ?  (814)
and also 卢克 joins the army remove the government ?  (815)
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is how to win ?  (817)
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders .  (818)
and i hope to our children in this environment -- oz -- up the world , not to beat up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality .  (819)
why do we show kids movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ?  (820)
about men &apos;s violence for women &apos;s film impact , there are many brilliant article analysis , you should look at . write very well .  (821)
a lot to affect boy , i read the article not that much .  (822)
in my own experience , 从莱娅 for the environment are getting to be my direct experience in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; men and women of 混居 . &quot;  (823)
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i do a mission , winning 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be standing here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time dealing with other and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 .  (829)
of course , also lots of examples , and i &apos;ll in front of you for disney princess they defend .  (830)
but these movies for boys , and it was not expect these films .  (831)
the film is largely a all because that &apos;s how we teach girls against 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society .  (832)
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 .  (833)
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this image vivid role , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i tell you all recommend this film . now are being shown in .  (836)
you remember the brave legends criticism , &quot; just project ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe it 皮克斯 began to make the movies . &quot;  (838)
that &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , the movie all by 贝克德 test , &quot; no . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
this test for not known , but today , maybe we can do about them .  (842)
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her and a friend in and they saw the movie about content .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)
think about the standard .  (845)
if , female characters in movies are talking about ?  (846)
if you have a conversation , with their common 心上人 talk about it ?  (847)
okay ? thank you .  (848)
thank you very much .  (849)
two women , to have to speak , there .  (850)
there was this film . i saw , but we &apos;ve seen in and enjoy movies is very rare .  (851)
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen quality of a good film 阿尔戈 . &quot;  (852)
oscar the movie , work really well , the standard hollywood movie high quality .  (853)
but bell doerr test f .  (854)
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film that most of what &apos;s happening in plot 人质 has been hijacked big events in 使馆 , men and women are hidden inside .  (855)
we see scene for the men in place to be profound and very anxious . and one of the movie actor , and the nice story is the next door said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot;  (856)
this is hollywood .  (857)
let &apos;s look at the numbers .  (858)

i don &apos;t know his name , but i knew his story .  (892)
he lived in somalia in a small village  (893)
it &apos;s very 加迪休 village from the capital .  (894)
this little village , because it &apos;s been so drought 食不果腹 poor people .  (895)
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities .  (896)
he got there , no , no , no prospects opportunities .  (897)
and only lived in a tent that town in the country &apos;s 加迪休 .  (898)
and the last year , it &apos;s nothing .  (899)
one day , he had a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch .  (900)
he discovered a bunch of people living , and he &apos;s got rest .  (901)
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes can give their own native to send money .  (902)
they give he introduced a young girl .  (903)
and they did .  (904)
he started new life .  (905)
he lives have goals .  (906)
in one day 加迪休 &apos;s in the sky 碧蓝 there was a car bombing .  (907)
this is the city of my little boy is the suicide bombers , and it did help dynamic people are &quot; for youth &quot; a party , and al qaeda terrorist organization relationships .  (908)

he was waiting for a chance on his waiting for the future can move a road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road .  (911)
this is going to be like in 成年期 from his first encounter .  (912)
and his story was over the world with different downtown .  (913)
this is a story about power , taken from the urban youth unemployment story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out of things .  (914)
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means job opportunities , wealth , but people didn &apos;t have to them in the city .  (915)
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment .  (916)
by 2030 , five people living in cities , there &apos;s three is 18 to these people .  (917)
if we &apos;re developing cities of the young people don &apos;t think , of course , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for the 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and the gang 雷池 will be the future of cities .  (918)
i was born in cities , more 加迪休 70 percent of people in unemployment .  (919)
70 percent didn &apos;t work didn &apos;t read books .  (920)
basically do nothing  (921)
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and i met with 玛迪娜 hospital home that i was born in the hospital .  (922)
i remember standing that are full of play in front of an eye hospital , i think if i don &apos;t leave it would be ?  (923)
if i have to get at the same waiting 成年期 ?  (924)
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ?  (925)
and i did say no .  (926)
i came last month &apos;s 加迪休 reason to do is actually a young leadership and entrepreneurship summit .  (927)
i brought about 90 somalia to lead  (928)
we sat down and working together solutions to a city of the biggest problem .  (929)
one in the room called aden young people .  (930)
he &apos;s in the 加迪休 university and graduated .  (931)
there was no job nothing .  (932)
i think he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , it was very frustrated party &quot; for youth &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit .  (933)
the people that look like this .  (934)
but his story , it &apos;s another version  (935)
in 加迪休 , it &apos;s from a to b to the biggest obstacle was the  (936)
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , it actually became the easy-to-use tools .  (937)
aden found opportunity and grab on it .  (938)
he built a motorcycle company .  (939)
started a motorcycle cab to the people who buy motorbikes .  (940)
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆  (941)
he &apos;s story of how different ?  (942)
what makes the difference ?  (943)
i believe is his and find opportunities to grasp opportunity .  (944)
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is waiting for the most effective 成年期 .  (945)
he drove young people become they had been crazy searching for economic opportunity makers .  (946)
you can put people into training .  (947)
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a conference he called doctor-heroes mohamoud is a 名花 business .  (948)
he was helping me in training business summit part of the young people how to grow them how to create entrepreneurial innovation .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; you see the flowers , what is it ? &quot; for many was born in civil wars , who was their answer would be , &quot; never seen . &quot;  (950)
so doctor-heroes from that opportunity .  (951)
he created an 园林 greening and design and companies .  (952)
he &apos;s in 加迪休 go out on a agriculture he started to grow and tulip 百合花 and he said that it had to make it &apos;s bad 加迪休 climate .  (953)
and he started to send to the wedding spend 家庭式 garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s the building &apos;s busy 加迪休 22年 to the first park citizens .  (954)
there &apos;s no 加迪休 in today &apos;s citizens of the park .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for young people together , family can here as he said , to feel rose 花香 and enlightenment .  (956)
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire the young people and in that room , mohamed , to come here , very deeply affected young people .  (958)
they don &apos;t want to business .  (959)
they had to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he innovation for those people very big .  (960)
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city .  (961)
he makes them think they can also be entrepreneurs can be changing the world .  (962)
and the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to solve the city of the most tricky issues right now .  (963)
they came up with a business solution to local problems .  (964)
so young companies to create a culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need mentors expertise and guide development and take them on their business .  (966)
for young people with the resources they need to give them support and helping them on the idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for cities  (967)
for me , entrepreneurship is not on business  (968)
it involves creating social impact .  (969)
mohamed is not just in sells flowers  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , it will be truly change people to the city .  (972)
side street aden hire him for a cab and help strengthen the motorcycle  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to escape from waiting to escape from 成年期 unfortunate .  (974)
these young entrepreneurs are for their cities have a profound impact .  (975)
so my suggestion is that move more young people become entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have to spend more and more peace park story there rather than the car bomb 成年期 and wait .  (976)
thank you .  (977)

&quot; 門 &quot; signs , just like wild about comfort in a couple of cars on the door .  (1001)
i call this eight words for basic words .  (1002)
it &apos;s a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words .  (1003)
&quot; a man . &quot;  (1004)
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot;  (1005)
there is a saying that , people from two to three people , for the public .  (1006)
if somebody open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot;  (1007)
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; the world , people were stuck .  (1008)
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about get stuck in whales in the stomach .  (1009)

&quot; fire 两团 &quot; together , it becomes very &quot; hot . &quot;  (1016)
&quot; fire 三团 &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much .  (1017)
it &apos;s two trees in the next , will &quot; burn &quot; .  (1018)
for us , everything from the sun &apos;s life .  (1019)
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around .  (1020)
the sun three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot;  (1021)
when the sun and the moon in these together , and it &apos;s called the light . &quot;  (1022)
one day after a night , is &quot; tomorrow . &quot;  (1023)
from the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; 旦 . &quot;  (1024)
&quot; a door . &quot; and put the block of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot;  (1025)
take a 张嘴 on the door , is &quot; ask . &quot;  (1026)
&quot; bang ! &quot; , someone at home ?  (1027)
