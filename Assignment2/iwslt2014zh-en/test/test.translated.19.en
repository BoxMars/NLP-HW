jay meg : why 30 is not new 20 . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need psychiatric patient treatments . 
when i was in college berkeley read a clinical psychologist . they 3d students . 
she was a woman named alex 26 . 
the first meeting , alex wore jeans and the slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in my office , sit directly to the couch , kick off her shoes , and she said to me , is to tell me about the men . 
when i heard this , and i disengaged . 
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so i have 一个二十几岁 people i want to talk about boys . 
i thought i could manage this thing . 
but i can &apos;t do that . 
alex in every meeting , will bring funny story , so to me , and the first 点点 on the results of the time is a really easy thing . 
alex would say , &quot; this is the new , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later , in order to have to have children , even after death is to have . 
like alex like me who is 二十几岁 except for nothing outside . 
but not too long , i started to push it on my 催 alex love life . 
i said no . 
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next one of these people getting married . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists call &quot; and it turns out that ! &quot; moment . 
and in that moment , i learned that 30 is not new 二十岁 . 
yeah , people more than ever late 安顿 down , but that doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between her development 低谷 . 
this makes alex 二十几岁 developed a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there kill it . 
and i realized that this &quot; kindness &quot; oversight , it &apos;s a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love for life around people 二十几岁 family and the future . 
now , the united states has about 5千万 二十几岁 people . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think about that nobody can experience in this phase 二十几岁 case went through adults . 
if you &apos;re 二十几岁 , take a hand . 
i really wanted to see here the 一些二十几岁 people . 
that &apos;s great ! you &apos;re awesome . 
if you work with 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people and o failed , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people are very important . 
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime 80 percent of the most important moment occurred in 35 years old . 
that means every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with &quot; ! &quot; moment of that . there are eight happened in 30 中旬 . 
over 40 years , people don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money you &apos;re going to make a very big impact . 
we know more than half of america before the 30 and mate 终生 married , 同居 , or on a date . 
we know in your brain when 二十几岁 to adapt to the second time period as adults are the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own what , now is to change its time . 
we know life than other stages 二十岁 , some of the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do . 
so your 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body and the choice is the future of the time . 
so when we talk about children &apos;s development five years ago , we all know the language of brain development and admiration critical period . 
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact period of time . 
but we &apos;ve heard a little there &apos;s a thing called adult development , and our 二十岁 this stage is the critical period for adults development . 
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard . 
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change . 
researchers have called 二十几岁 extending adolescence . 
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid names , like , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , we get is actually adult 期中 known as the most important decades doesn &apos;t matter . 
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time . 
this is not right ? 
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ? 
doesn &apos;t happen . 
you take that guy and urgency worked , but nothing happening . 
or &quot; everyone said , &quot; well , if i just before the 30 started my career , that &apos;s fine . &quot; this kind of thing . 
but then they start talking about , &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have the show . 
i graduated from the best day 写写 my résumé . &quot; 
and then they start talking about , &quot; when 二十几岁 date as a seat in games . 
you &apos;re running around , and , in the middle of it , but to about 30 music will stop off a after another , you start to sit down . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &quot; chair &quot; . &quot; 
and the 二十几岁 people out there ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
well , you hear that may seem a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , and very high currency . 
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and start looking like that , in this phase 三十几岁 and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big . 
in the middle of a thousand years after the crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy . 
that is not my job is that they want . 
that is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or can &apos;t give their children a long . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people to do what we think . 
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do . 
this is a about a woman called emma story . 
when emma 25 , because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at . 
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she showed that worked 脾气 more and more than any at all live together . 
and no matter how hard it is her 二十几岁 , her life was much more difficult . 
she was meeting , crying , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took her to fill a morning people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this a ... &quot; &quot; the blank behind . 
the last 歇斯底里 she looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot; 
and i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment . 
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make a decision that emma for 10 years pass by it off . 
so in the next weeks and months , i taught in every three emma 二十几岁 people , both men and women are , should hear things . 
first of all , i tell emma forget her identity crisis then accumulate identity capital . 
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value . 
do you think about this , what &apos;s going to be investment . 
i didn &apos;t know emma professional future , and nobody knows the future of our work , but i know that these : identity capital will to do more identity capital . 
and that is to be a professional multinational , in that space , and you want to step up to the time . 
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to tell you cannot called exploration . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count . 
secondly , i tell emma tribes , cities overestimate . 
the new capital , the new can get almost always about people from the inside of the external communities . 
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends . 
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment . 
but half is not that connection is weak , and put yourself in a group that way . 
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and reach your neighbor &apos;s boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 working methods . 
it &apos;s not cheating . this is information about how to deliver science . 
and finally , emma that people don &apos;t choose a family , but can choose friends . 
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people &apos;s emma , soon to pass and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family . 
i tell emma choice family time is now . 
you might think , is a 30 than 20 , 25 is even better off of the time , and i agreed . 
but when you start getting married in other people into the auditorium , and you manage your 同居 or sleep people don &apos;t call progress . 
in &apos;s marriage kung fu and the best time is married before , which means love is like to do with the work of consciousness . 
choice family is conscious choices that you want to people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose your that people wasted time . 
and how that emma ? 
well , and it turns out that address thin , and she found her a roommate had a family in another in an art museum work . 
the faint . she was there for a job . 
and that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons . 
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and her a consciously chose people get married . 
she loved her new career , she loved his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emerging 联系人 behind a big enough to . &quot; 的卡 pieces . 
emma story that &apos;s something that sounds very simple , but that &apos;s what i love and 二十几岁 people that work . 
it &apos;s so easy to help them . 
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport go somewhere in the west flights . 
and the fly , a little challenging is further and further in alaska in fiji difference . 
likewise , or even 25 is in 21 29岁 , a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 down is even a few generations have a very big impact . 
this gives a worth spreading , you know , for every person 二十几岁 ideas . 
it and i learned to say to alex as simple . 
don &apos;t get you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re in determines your life . 
thank you . 
李镇河 : 李镇河 into the computer : &quot; real world , you play &quot; infinite imagination . 
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s our real world and the gap between the virtual world , in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , which is a touchscreen glass that thin , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world borders between the good ? 
so i started to try this crazy idea . 
i first made that tool , it can number into space , if you take this with a pen that force on the screen , and lots of a pen and goes into a little pixels of virtual worlds . 
designers directly in three-dimensional space for their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery . 
so , this is a tool that broke the virtual and real world borders between . 
but we also hands on the screen . 
how can we reach into and digital information to have interaction , we have to use my hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space to work in the least numbers . 
because window file in real time and space have a particular location , they pick becomes like a book with shelves from so easily . 
and you can read this book , and in every window floating and virtual touch board out across words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands or stretched rotate all sorts of things . 
in this case , that we &apos;re now entering the digital world . 
but how can transform it to get the role of digital information into our world ? 
that many people here have online shopping and 退货 experience . 
but now than you don &apos;t worry about . 
because i , there &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 in line . 
this is the system we analyzed the physical features , geometry , through your head of driving , or look at a way that show us all . 
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make our space these visible pixels little switch to actually get to touch , feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve 雷米 persian , make it in a matter of &quot; pixels . &quot; 
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 like we are in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and people will move the object in that three-dimensional space 一三维 little any place . 
our basic principles , it &apos;s the gravity pellets for work , and it &apos;s magnetically levitated mechanical drive and goes into a combination of technology to control pellets movement . 
by the number of programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , you can move in a physical world can be recorded , and back forever , keep . 
so , dance 编排 can be remote and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action can over and over and over again , to actually be repeated itself . 
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force . 
more exciting is that this is not the computer put things into a real matter , it &apos;s starting to imagine programming world , and we &apos;re going to change a regular physical activity . 
and as you can see , digital information will not take things for us , but that &apos;s going to start working on us to become part of our physical environment , not with the real world we cut the ties . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we could remove the border , the rest of us are enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
&apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 had two 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years . 
when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , all free . 
my mother said , &quot; no , the tiger . &quot; 
my parents , and i hope they elephants as long as engineers . i want my parents elephants as long as they are engineers . 
as 文革 survivor , they think happiness -- the only way to get a 高薪 reliable security . 
and i liked or not . that doesn &apos;t matter . 
but i dream is becoming 黄梅戏 actor . 
that &apos;s my premise playing the piano . 
戏曲 actor to start to learn from small 身段 kung fu 戏曲 actor , to start to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i want to do all the way to go to school 黄梅戏 . 
even wrote to the principal 戏校 with a radio host . 
but there was a big people love that idea . 
not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious . 
there &apos;s only my 小伙伴 them for me , but they also a child , and i did powerless . 
it was 15 , i know i &apos;m going to learn how to play , too old already . 
my dream is no longer going to do . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ah ! my god . 
ok , i decided to find another mission for themselves . 
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learned from the book . 
&#91; &quot; 三毛 全集 &quot; and &quot; 南怀瑾 historical experience . &quot; i 1995 , to the united states in the united states , what i first read a book ? 
of course , is that the chinese 禁书 . 
the earth about &quot; is china farmers . 
you &apos;re not really convenient propaganda . okay . 
bible is quite interesting , but also very strange . 
the topic 他日 talk again . 
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; and that &apos;s not far from the &quot; submission . &quot; 
it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool , it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool to rebuild , my relationship with their parents . 
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from a big to use a world map . 
i &apos;ve never realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily need to map in the world . 
it turns out that maps with a view . 
compare reading is not new . 
it &apos;s academia standards in practice . 
比较文学 , even more religion being studied field of religion . 比较文学 , even become specialized research . 
compared to control scholars for a project has a full understanding . contrast to control scholars for a project has a full understanding . 
i wonder , and that &apos;s reading on useful , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ? 
so i started putting a book about to read . 
they can be about the same event , different parties , they can be about the same event , different parties , or two friends have shared experience . 
what is the experience of economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desires and fear and social responsibility -- interesting . 
if you understand the language , put your book like two language . but it was very interesting . 
so thomas 默 translation . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 watts , &quot; the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost one , i was discovered that translation can lead to harvest . 
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning it &apos;s called &quot; quick joy , &quot; well ... 
&quot; bride chinese word for it , and the literal meaning &quot; new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
and i had become 今人 communicate with an amazing discovery , portal book because i had become with 今人 communication , a magic . 
let me just don &apos;t feel helpless alone . 
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 anything . 
i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose . 
it &apos;s the most important for our goal is to touch the dream sources of places where the source , passion , happiness sources of places . 
even a broken 灭 dreams can get your experiencing that touch . 
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , live happily , life of purpose and meaning to become clear , in most of the time . 
and hope and never will you at any age . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
john 帕鲁尔 塞加尔 : 颂歌 envy . 
when i was eight , new classes to a woman , she was so striking , like all the new to that girl . 
she had a lot of the 光泽 秀发 a cute little 文具盒 specialize in a week that name on the spell that no one can than 
and that year , i was the people were envy until i figured out that evil . 
one day i came from school , and the second 逗留 it to leave a night , i &apos;ve been silently sit on the toilet 
and at that time , i would go from a 出动 classroom teachers get the score for the table . 
and then i conspiracy win by stopping . 
and i change my opponents scores to just a little bit , is to a certain wait 降级 . 
well , it &apos;s all a . 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other students also have high score awfully ! 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all the way that nothing but and creativity 
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line , because i &apos;ve been in it , more to do something completely 
now i don &apos;t understand my behavior . 
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out . 
i don &apos;t know why it &apos;s wonderful to do that . 
i was feeling great . 
i don &apos;t know why i had never been found 
i mean , this thing to do so . 
i hasn &apos;t been found . 
but importantly , so why i care about this girl , in this tiny little girls so good at spell ? this point i keep confusion . 
let me jealous of time . 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that babies are the envy of torture 
i knew primates envy blue 知更鸟 very comfortable with envy . 
we know the envy spouses murder agents . 
but i never read an research could explain , &quot; &quot; envy lonely it is a long time , or the brutal . 
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
well , i don &apos;t know it &apos;s not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have a literary ? 
if not 忠 ocean , it &apos;s not the odyssey . &quot; 
no 妒忌 where the king , there is no &quot; 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we have high school reading 书单 because we &apos;re losing the 喧嚣 riots were lost . &quot; and &quot; remarkable &quot; is the gates than the sun rises , &quot; are losing the lady 包法利 . &quot; &quot; anna 卡列琳 nathalie . &quot; 
no , no 普鲁斯 jealous . now , i mean , i know that people always say , love 普鲁斯 know anything , but said he was really jealous of this thing to understand . 
this is his 巨著 追忆 , &quot; water &quot; 年华 一百周年 this piece is about as clear and the envy of research that we can think of common 竞争性 , which is that i was . 
when we think we would expect 普鲁斯 , the emotional . right ? 
we think about a little boy is 入梦 
in a piece of cake 玛德琳 薰 衣草茶 . 
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye . 
he &apos;s so cold , no compassion 
these books , in virginia 伍尔夫 seems like a cat gut . 
i don &apos;t know what the cat , but we can suppose it as 坚 顽石 . 
let &apos;s look at these things come together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and jealous 普鲁斯 , with envy . 
妒忌 up to people , and from that desire to become a firm foundation narrative is not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it profoundly push our sensitive nerve because just think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we get jealous , when we &apos;re going to make a story . 
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they were just to let the &apos;d suffered . 
we tell ourselves as stories , and the audience know exactly where to join the details where fatal in 一刀 . right ? 
let &apos;s have a novelist amateur 普鲁斯 , and that can understand . 
all she did what i &apos;m happy thing is going to give someone happy , maybe now is going on ? &quot; 
this is what he began to create their own story , and then 普鲁斯 close-up of that , and he &apos;s a new lover . &quot; he 虐 密室 together as a series of tools . &quot; 
now we have to admit , 斯万 and 普鲁斯 two people , the infamous envy . 
you know , there were my boyfriend 普鲁斯 . if you want to tell him that 分手 to escape from this country . 
but you don &apos;t need so envy will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
let &apos;s body 疲 its time . 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , have to get . 
envy like this ? 
envy love information . 
like detail . 
like a big put 光泽 秀发 cute 文具盒 . 
like envy . 
this is so instagram fire . 
it will actually 普鲁斯 academic language with envy 相联 language . 
when the struggle of in his envy of suddenly he started standing at the bribe , he started 偷听 lover servants &apos; quarters of the defense for him . 
he said , &quot; look , i know you think this annoying , but it and interpret a 古文 or watching a memorial no two . &quot; 
he said , &quot; these are the scientific research , a real knowledge value . &quot; 
grief , loss , shame : these are 普林斯 , to wisdom . 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman has made our pain . we all emotional than , let &apos;s interested in a genius can have more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel woman ? 
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what themselves . 
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotional would allow us to see their hostility , your intentions ugly heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that says that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think he did his wife and so 憔悴 ours . 
freud think this guy kind of weird because he didn &apos;t really concerned with his wife do . 
because with his wife &apos;s , you know . 
this poor guys just 缘由 , no doubt . 
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move . 
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it &apos;s very good at novel about how we see training pitch , but not gets it right . 
well , we get jealous of the strong , we &apos;re going to more often . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do things violent or illegal . 
envy causes our behavior becomes extreme . 
i admit that i got was eight years old . but i also see on the news came up with a story . 
michigan women 一个52岁 discovered a registered fake facebook account and use that accounts for their year sending out the malicious news . 
a year . for one year . 
she &apos;s trying to her 陷害 before the aisles girlfriend now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her . 
because , i want to say , you face reality . 
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , right ? 
this comes from fiction . 
a pie 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel . 
i really love is 海史密斯 writers . 
she &apos;s in the united states 文学史 brilliant and 诡 one page . 
for example , tom , but in her case , the most famous . 
里普利 started to you or want what you have , then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in his basement 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but we do ? we cannot repeat 里普利 . 
i can &apos;t tell the world has dramatically , even if i would one day be able to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in admire times . 
we live in envy . 
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , right ? 
it can give us a novel solution ? i &apos;m not sure 
let &apos;s 学学 fictional characters , to look at them with puzzles and the right thing is , don &apos;t know how to do . 
let &apos;s go back to 贝克街 221 夏洛克 de 福尔摩斯 ask the b . 
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would want to his adversaries 里亚蒂 professor -- this genius . 
but i &apos;ve always liked to a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face a scottish 头子 he really needed to 福尔摩斯 his intelligence , but hate him . 
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this . 
he &apos;s 垂 雷斯 needed help , and he hated the secret of the cases 侦破 always and 苦闷 story . 
we proud of you . &quot; 
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold 福尔摩斯 . 
this is what we saw 少数几次 福尔摩斯 in the human being moved , and when i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it &apos;s like having as a geometry , instead of emotions . 
this one minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite 
the next minute they stand in the same . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he used to hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if it &apos;s a geometric problem to do , a about how we choose your relationship with other questions ? 
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate somebody talent . 
we &apos;ll chase . 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment , here we have to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction 
it has been going on with envy fiction 
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it now . 
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy a million and a 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there . 
we have so good . 
thank you . 
ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash . 
so i was 10 , and once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a in the new york in the zone . 
it was really good weather . 
the forest searched twinkling lights . 
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like the 晶莹 stained glass . if you don &apos;t have the little feet , we have to pretend that we &apos;re at this piece of the first human . 
we eventually got to our camp . 
it &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing . 
in the back of the cliff camp , have a for about 40 feet of 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil , paper and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing . 
people to camp was too lazy , even with all the ourselves up not ready . they think who would have 善后 for them ? 
the problem is baffling to all the time . i became a longer sound bite . 
who &apos;s going to have we leave the garbage ? 
but you can take this issue on any place you live in a 伊斯坦 . we leave out the garbage ? 
in rio we leave out the garbage ? in paris and london ? 
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector , we have to leave the 000吨 11 , and the day of the 2000吨 recycled . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know who &apos;s doing this work . 
wear sanitation trucks were parked on this up in a sense of responsibility for what ? 
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project . 
i was sitting in the car , and along the track , on a new york at the office workers live and work the sanitation trucks were parked . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not just sitting in 垃圾车 , i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 . 
my own manipulate the electric its 扫帚 street , in the snow 铲 . 
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process . 
everyone can be asked the smell . 
there &apos;s a smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad . but you &apos;ll soon will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even though there are a few years working side of worker , their bodies have adapted to try and into a week megatons of garbage . 
so there is at risk . 
with the labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked american work is the most dangerous of tasks , and then you figure out why . 
you all day on the road , which are of traffic . 
out of the cars , thinking only , than you drive people tend to not careful . 
for the sanitation trucks were parked for me , it was terrible . 
and what are the full of poison , these 毒物 often from the 垃圾车 comes out , a horrible harm . 
i also learned the brutal and frightening . 
when you go down , 路沿 sanitation trucks were parked car in the city , you will look at a time to recognize the really like the power of nature itself . 
it &apos;s never 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like breath , or a circular form . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked . 
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important workforce . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient every day , and the waste from the container itself , bring it to poison in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we were attacked several century decade 和数 disease will again , we started to threaten our health . 
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , we have no space something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consumption down . 
i don &apos;t use capitalism , here i am just point out their relationship . 
and the third reason -- is what i call the average , and we need to 经常性 activity speed . 
i mean in today &apos;s and the old days , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , and it &apos;s clean and carried it around our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and they throw it away , and forget about them , because we know that there is a work in teams were sitting over there get those things is densest . 
so today i want to suggest to you about the sanitation trucks were parked situation to help , maybe they &apos;re called . please bring them to talk about how to create a sustainable city thousands of people . 
i think their work is really matters . 
every time they , in the street to individual hard work . 
in many cities , they &apos;re wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work . 
you know they to refuse clean on time . 
they are allowing us to secure in their work . 
they almost became secure that work . 
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and junk . this is going to work in need of stability . 
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks and 咆哮 , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing a week he 三都 do work . 
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , and again , i met this guy . 
his name is 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends . 
i want to believe that 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
the city , we know that the trash just actually the amount of the three percent . 
this is an amazing data . 
so in your life every day , in your life , into the next time you see somebody and you leave out the garbage , please find a time 致意 to them . 
find a time to say thank you . 
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory . 
please close your eyes to me . 
imagine you &apos;re standing outside your door . 
please 一下门 attention and the color of the materials . 
now , imagine a naked people on the overweight . 
going on a naked cycling to your front door up and running . 
to try to imagine 近在眼前 alive .

and then hit 径直 in your front door . 
bike flew 四下 go flying off from the wheel you as a rolling spoke into that corner of embarrassing .

she &apos;s exposed to wear you coffee table , dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot; 
and with i walked in your kitchen . 
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 drill out your oven came to you is &quot; 绿野 仙 &quot; tracking the dorothy 铁皮 people 稻草人 and lions their hands on 蹦蹦跳跳 walking arm in arm , to come to you . 
okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;m going to tell you a annual spring in new york are going to have the unexpected . 
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory . 
a few years ago , as a journalist 科技类 this race to the part about trying to get there , like &quot; geeks who super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot; 
a bunch of men and women 屈指可数 grew up in some old boy is still don &apos;t notice personal health 
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that hundreds of any of the list . 
some are trying to remember the populations of strangers . 
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem . 
and in the game , who is the fastest way down to remember 一整副 打乱 card sequence . 
and i thought that &apos;s amazing . 
these people surely other talents 禀 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training . 
i asked him , &quot; ed is when you start to realize their memory is genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; i &apos;m not experts . 
and my memory was . 
to this each one of them will tell you just average memory . 
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot; 
we stood outside the hall smart 过人 amazing and a little bit weird british josh ed said to me , &quot; you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really wanted to in the u.s. national radio taught britney remember how 一整副 打乱 card sequence . 
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
i said , &quot; look , i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me ! 
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot; 
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 out in front of me . 
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he suffers amnesia his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia is very surprising . 
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can learn in which the memory of shape our personality . 
this is another extreme i met somebody like this . 
his name is kim peek 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; role in . 
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library back to phone books , i think is just fascinating . 
and i went back home and i read a lot about memory writing on the front 两千多年 article written in latin from ancient until then , during the medieval 
and i learned a lot of really interesting things . 
one is used to train beam may grow memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 people want it to your memories could 不遗余力 to your mind . 
these technologies for modern life possible , but also we changed . 
not only in the culture , and i think in cognitive . 
kids don &apos;t need to remember that sometimes we already forgot how to memory . 
in this place on earth are very few places that makes you think people still interested in training beam may grow memory the memory of a contest . 
it &apos;s not that different everywhere are starting to do this . 
i was obsessed with this thought , you know , how are these people do . 
a few years ago london at the university of a team of researchers asked to a contest to study memory . 
they want to figure out the human brain if we follow each other in structure anatomically different ? 
the answer is no 
and they are smarter than us ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny . 
but compared with the goal is to control the challenges of our memory champion brain had a really interesting is very different . 
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory digital or 人脸 or pattern kind , researchers found that memory champion challenges of our brain areas activated with ordinary people don &apos;t . 
notice that they think , is in the brain in space and memory , it would take to navigate . 
why ? what can we figure out what kind of thing ? 
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective way 赛场 memory show and other people have to catch up 
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there . 
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 sequence card to him for an hour down with all that is a he actually invented , they were just going to him . 
and this with the same way that he had a word , not bad back down 4140个 any alignment binary . only half an hour . 
very impressive . 
in these 参赛者 of competition with a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all these skills will end up going into a conceptual psychologists call a delicate code . &quot; 
the concept could with a paradox of humor is perfect interpret baker / baker paradox is easy to say that i have two people to remember one word i said , &quot; if you remember a guy called baker . &quot; 
baker &apos;s name . 
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot; 
after a while back and i asked you to remember what i call &quot; before you remember that term ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what word ? &quot; 
being told is 人名 baker people remember that term potential as far as not being told a baker , the person . 
the same word cause different memories . 
why is it ? 
because 人名 baker no special . 
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any . 
but baker used it as a noun that we all know the baker . 
baker with funny white cap . 
they hand and flour . 
they came home from work with 扑鼻 a toast . 
maybe some people have friends are baker 
we first hear this word , immediately generates all kinds of ways that we can make in after a while , can still remember . 
this precise memory 两千五百年 skills in front of the ancient greeks had it . 
and call it palace . 
developed this technique is one called simonides following the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party 
and he &apos;s been asked to do the performing guest because in the &apos; cool fancy party . it &apos;s not just d. j. to beat reduction , but please poet ode to come . 
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died . 
not all death all dead were to come down on 面目全非 
no one said to them what are some people who don &apos;t like to tell who sat where 
that causes the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬 
and then this reinforce the whole thing color tragedy . 
simonides as standing outside the rubble only survivor close your eyes to realize is thrust upon in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 can sit . 
he would hold hands are relative through the site to bring them up around . 
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 thing about all of you have probably guessed . it &apos;s no matter how much we are not remember name phone number or colleagues every instructions that we all have very keen visual or space memory capacity . 
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i &apos;ve been telling stories simonides 10 years ago , &quot; don &apos;t have a few people will remember . 
but i bet you now , if i put down your back in the foyer . sat will speak brown on 骏马 who is that you see , i just saying . 
this advice from the latin 两千多年 before the first scholars memory . 
so this phrase principles of what ? 
suppose you were invited to stand on the ted stage , and you want to talk to 脱稿 as 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome tedx talk on and so he &apos;ll 霸气 step one and you want . 
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their 
and imagine working out with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster ed mr. sitting on the back . 
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook . 
and then you have a mind britney 小甜甜 . you &apos;ll remember to talk about britney that little story . 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topics are you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association 
this is presenting rome home talk reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just be the only reciting 添麻烦 but remember , one by one . 
it &apos;s the theme &quot; phrase &quot; is from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is 古时候 people talk about , or a rhetorical took place . 
&quot; the phrase &quot; means your memory 第一层 palace . 
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started a 萌发 more detailed it that the memory of my culture . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is memory process is very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there . 
very exciting moment don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source . 
i &apos;m a journalist had written a bit ! 
i know that these people in your mind must be 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see as 外人 
i realized that if i really think about these things have to have to experience . 
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes to do something . 
there &apos;s little back . 
back in my back 跳蚤市场 bought in 年鉴 old people . 
i was surprised to find it very 带劲 
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise 
it &apos;s goal is not to train memory . 
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working to create the myth is hopefully very funny 胡乱 unforgettable images . 
and it became my joy . 
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit . 
it &apos;s a whole 镜面 护目镜 耳塞 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the largest attention that is the enemy . 
and i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 . 
i also want to drive a signed up to participate in the news was that as an experiment . 
i thought to be , in the 前言 调侃 it yourself . 
the problem is experiment finally got unexpected consequences 
i won the competition . it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles . 
don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember 几副 sequence of the cards and you can actually learn from the brain does have some benefits . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think that human talent is unlike the 禀 is not . 
powerful memory is can acquire . 
from the fundamental 专心致志 can keep talking about . 
engaged , can remember 
memory palace or that memory skills are just 捷径 . 
and they really can &apos;t be 捷径 
this work is because it forces you to think about 
it forces you to go deeper , to want more you focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to this training . 
and 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist . 
this is what we have to remember things . 
let me find my experience in our bodies 潜藏 with incredible memory capacity . 
but if you want to live memorable do is to remember that a lot of people . 
thank you . 
and who lee duke 沃斯 : success ? willpower . 
on my 27th , and i left a very challenging -- a professional management consulting company , turn it into a more challenging professional : education . 
i came to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math . 
and the other teachers , i &apos;ll give students do little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
when these 试卷 homework and open up , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq , the ups are not my best and the worst between the only difference . 
some in the 课业 did quite well students don &apos;t have very high iq score on . 
some very smart kids , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 . 
this got me thinking . 
of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like , a small percentage , parallel computation 四边形 area . 
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbooks content , as long as they would spend time and effort . 
after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in terms of education , we need to learn from the dynamic perspective and psychological level , the students and learning . take a more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we all know evaluating students a standard is iq , but if you &apos;re in schools and the good life do not just as easily efficient depend on your ability to learn ? 
all i left the stage , back to school and entered psychology master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids and adults are , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and in a study where , in my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they succeeding ? 
i and my research group 西点 point to do research . 
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out . 
we see the first to build a word , but also try to anticipate what kids can level-up in the end game . 
we study in hostile environment for work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students . 
we work with 私企 , to ask them what sales people can stay in . 
what can the more money ? 
in all these different context , a character that no one out of the characteristics , largely predicted success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
it &apos;s not nice appearance , robust . and it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on . 
tenacity is have perpetual 恒 something happened . 
tenacity is you for the future , with every day is not just for a week or a month , but a few years , and for decades trying to make their dream a reality . 
tenacity is put life as a marathon , it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in the public school , i started studying willpower . 
i said to the 初中生 千名 conducted a survey of about willpower , and waiting for more than a year , to see what ultimately to graduate students . 
everything is not just in 西点 point or in the competition to build the words that willpower in school . this is also , especially for those in the dropout 徘徊 children . 
for my own self , about tenacity me the most incredible things , tenacity is heading for us to develop willpower , cognitive science in understanding how much was poor . 
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and what they move the long-term is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t going to give you gritty heart . 
our data suggests that very clearly , there are many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , according to our data rates , usually willpower with other factors , it has nothing to do with the brilliance measures run counter . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard in kids qualities tough to grow the most effective called &quot; growth model for thinking . &quot; 
stanford 卡洛杜 william , with a view , and he believed that the human learning can change it , as you try to measure the change . 
professor 杜威克 means , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain and its facing challenges , what was happening and growing situation , after they fail more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure . 
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower . 
but we need more . 
i decided at the end of my comments , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is what &apos;s in front of a job . 
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in back again . 
in other words , we just have to become more tenacity to allow our children to become more willpower . 
thank you . 
泽维尔 dimensions , that the : into local culture . 
as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , and to think about , building around with the environment , and with the buildings , around the environment , which is the relationship between tradition . 
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea . 
these two examples are emerging in a country , in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
these two examples , one thing in common is that design solutions and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping malls . 
this is what i and my team at the same for example , we were asked to design this way . 
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do . 
look at the same in this kind of architecture , the city -- it &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we &apos;ve discovered the architecture of the most important three questions . 
first , the building is basically empty , because they are in large store , people who are not big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because the roads are built outside of glass , this design would be trapped inside heat in architecture , it leads to what we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this city climate is very 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. . 
the third problem is the building looks like one african or ethiopia didn &apos;t matter . 
for a culture and abundance 底蕴 city , it &apos;s called us down . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , when i was a local 集贸市场 was mesmerized . . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the outside environment , from 小商贩 in various to buy products . 
that is compatible with my ideas , is in outdoor public setting the idea of creating activities . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the question is , how can we in such a contemporary architecture 多层 贯彻 of these ideas ? 
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapidly growing city in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , are we designing doesn &apos;t exist . 
and this building on the context of two parallel in the street , and there are no 几百米 little can connected . 
so we need to do is we use all of this very building a portal , these two way up to it . 
and we have a gradient of design 庭 , created an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 . 
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and different . 
i think , the question is , the buildings outside walls are decorated ? 
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment . 
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole made out of cement , to be able to use a controlled by the way , and the light and air to go into the building . 
we from ethiopia beautiful women on the pattern of traditional dress got inspiration . 
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to this question , of course , filled with the outside walls . 
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and by the way we manage to buildings . 
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night . 
these ideas , but we don &apos;t start building moved , and they react to things like , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all know , this design solutions to than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop . 
and this the design of the wall , a ton of lowering cost , not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of the air conditioning to control . 
and eventually , we have saved an part budget . 
where is the first question is , how do we make sure that the building in power , because we live in cities -- almost every day pushing 闸 electricity . 
so we were on the roof of the solar panels . 
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in the solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , to be here in cities , oasis 小憩 for people . 
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the interior of clean . 
we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , well . 
the second example is a city planners tunisia for more than a 2000套 apartment buildings and collateral infrastructure . 
to scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i only need was really understand the tunisian city , and she also need to understand these kinds of tradition and culture . 
and in the process , i kind of being a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a has over thousands of years of history , its structure brick wall , there are 12 相互之间 through the door , almost straight to the road . 
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 primary small region in size and all the characteristics we kind of in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning . 
in these blocks planning basis , referenced mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , changes in the beginning of the model . 
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , like a cubicle , is that this poses a fundamental part of planning . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is facing the best ? 
and the answer is , can use to 南北朝 house on either 南北 temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we do this kind of model for all the apartments , have perfect towards . 
this is the effect , we designed like an arab town , combined with style , european style residential together . 
some of the building areas with garden , and walk around on the ground to the full connection . 
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 population density of high , the population density is not very expensive . 
and she &apos;s right up to our entry even between 通性 demand . 
this is the roof of the project i 得意 part , it &apos;s like to take these by building the space and back to the community . 
the community can climb roof , and talk to each other poke somebody , god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or on the back and forth between jump . 
and there are two examples , in the design process took the same way . 
again , they are emerging in cities , you can see the little 拔地而起 building material . 
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s present to the local community and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate . 
for this reason , i think about the architectural design , the more important in between , which is , searching for simple solutions , and cheap enough to enhance and promote the local people and civic relationship , and to give you good close to nature . 
thank you very much . 
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . at first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said to the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche . 
i think there are three things like that . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus . 
the second one is : what we should have more 信任感 . 
the third mission is : we need to rebuild 信任感 . 
i think people to use this task , and it has the wrong way . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , and it has a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ? 
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls polls , to find out about 信任感 in decline . 
but when you really look at different times polls , actually , not many evidence supporting this idea . 
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and mainly politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted . 
and 20 years ago is highly trust people like that , and the nurse , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in the society 居中 people , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
poll records , of course , is that some people . 
or you can record polls ? 
but it &apos;s a general attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;re talking about . 
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ? 
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust businesses vegetable ? &quot; 
you sell fish trust ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart you ask . 
when you understand what the problem is , what would you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
a very rational answer . 
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways for trust . 
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types analyze it . the official civil servant , etc . , it will be types . 
for example , i would say , &quot; i believe , of course , i know a primary school math teacher will teach them how to read . but i don &apos;t believe that she can run bus . 
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers . 
i might believe that i love drinking friend &apos;s friends chatting . but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them , he &apos;s a secret to live . 
that &apos;s it . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence that there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 , so why poll , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ? 
i think poll was a very bad measure 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to consider 信任感 poor judgment . 
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ? 
that &apos;s what we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think this is pretty funny . 
i think it &apos;s not the purpose . 
i would say , they deserve to be trusted more to trust , and not to trust not trusted people . 
in fact , i mean , it was trying not to trust not trusted people . 
for example , who have yourself to earn that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money roll out 麦道 夫 people , and i think these people , yeah ? i mean , right , so easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
and very clever to trust to choose not to trust that &apos;s the purpose . 
so some people say , well , ok , this is not the most important not to trust , instead of credibility ? 
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy . 
i think right to make decisions about three to consider . 
they want to see whether or not ? it allows you to be honest , whether reliable ? 
if we think that one allows you to be , in his field allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe they , because they &apos;re reliable . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not with them to help me to send messages , because they &apos;re forget . 
i got some very confident friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident . 
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to be reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest . 
maybe one , i &apos;ve never found . 
we need is before : trust to look at his reputation reliability . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions in institutions , whether accountability needs to be a professional level or official asked these and making it easier for us to determine whether there was a reputation . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that . 
and i remember i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a than 手续 接生 a children &apos;s hard . &quot; 
in our public life , our institutions in life , we find a lot of questions . the institution of the accountability for these rules to protect his reputation as can be trusted by institutions to see it &apos;s the opposite . 
it allows people to focus their work , like they 助产士 , let them take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned . 
you actually had that experience . 
on purpose to talk about a lot . 
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is very quickly , like an attitude , there are not talking about it . 
and thirdly , about the task . 
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got a little . 
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust . 
well , we can do it for yourself . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but what &apos;s the matter , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from each other . 
you can &apos;t fix people say to you . 
you need to make people trying to get you any 家信 . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful , according to let them know that you are trustworthy . 
how to do that ? 
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work ? 
i give you just a simple , for example , marketing . 
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions . 
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me change color is my favorite socks . 
that &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me feel like they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very well be trusted . according to say to yourself , you have confidence . 
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell . 
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
john 科林 托克斯 : the movies manhood . 
as the father made me happy , is they like to see the film . 
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , together , we saw the 仙 绿野 spaces . &quot; 
and then a few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
this makes her own to look like the same 仙女 was holding 魔杖 . 
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll find this film is so special . 
now , we live , raise kids , kids are getting immersed in a fantastic complexity of the world . 
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot; 
it &apos;s not like that . 
this is a trend for 40 years later today to pop . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 and a guy 毛绒绒 to mimic the enemy to safeguard save a girl . 
you know that this is what movie ? ... 
right . 
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different , &quot; 绿野 仙 spaces like &quot; recent years we see in all aspects 两三 film , there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients . 
it &apos;s actually more violent , for instance , like this . 
but i think if we are tracking 仙 绿野 film , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of people . 
use your magic to beat slippers bad 巫婆 military . &quot; 
but it &apos;s not like that . 
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; sex and unique into image of the most heroic , intelligence , or bad people are women . 
i was in a few years later , with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; together , realizing that point , and it was a little different . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
it was three . 
he was too small , so we don &apos;t see his name . 
but as a second child , his family to take care of it all sort of a lot . 
and he also run in , and then in the mystery is like a little duck were seen as duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this film . but he clearly i became obsessed with this . 
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons . 
a subject that film out of courage , tenacity and faithful ? 
and also 卢克 joins the army remove the government ? 
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
dorothy is how to win ? 
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders . 
and i hope to our children in this environment -- oz -- up the world , not to beat up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality . 
why do we show kids movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ? 
about men &apos;s violence for women &apos;s film impact , there are many brilliant article analysis , you should look at . write very well . 
a lot to affect boy , i read the article not that much . 
in my own experience , 从莱娅 for the environment are getting to be my direct experience in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; men and women of 混居 . &quot; 
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
i do a mission , winning 芳 heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t know what to do . 
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time dealing with other and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 . 
of course , also lots of examples , and i &apos;ll in front of you for disney princess they defend . 
but these movies for boys , and it was not expect these films . 
the film is largely a all because that &apos;s how we teach girls against 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society . 
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 . 
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this image vivid role , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i tell you all recommend this film . now are being shown in . 
you remember the brave legends just &quot; criticism , project ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe it 皮克斯 began to make the movies . &quot; 
that &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , the movie all by 贝克德 test , &quot; no . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
this test for not known , but today , maybe we can do about them . 
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her and a friend in and they saw the movie about content . 
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
think about the standard . 
if , female characters in movies are talking about ? 
if you have a conversation , with their common 心上人 talk about it ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women , to have to speak , there . 
there was this film . i saw , but we &apos;ve seen in and enjoy movies is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen quality of a good film 阿尔戈 . &quot; 
oscar the movie , work really well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film that most of what &apos;s happening in plot 人质 has been hijacked big events in 使馆 , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see scene for the men in place to be profound and very anxious . and one of the movie actor , and the nice story is the next door said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot; 
this is hollywood . 
let &apos;s look at the numbers . 
the most popular front 2011 100部 movies , how many film a heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
but just picked congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , that &apos;s good enough . 
and the percentage of just higher and that &apos;s going to let you in shock . 
last year , new york times published a paper done by government . 
here &apos;s the content . 
in the united states every five women get one ever met 性骚扰 . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s in entertainment , through the wrong . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s for children to film . 
i even think porn music and movie with this just doesn &apos;t matter , but something &apos;s wrong . when i hear the statistics , i think this is the number of 性骚扰 is so much . 
who were they ? how they were teaching out ? 
they learned leaks ? 
they had no understanding of a movie plot men , a hero beat 残暴 反派 and get the glory and reward -- is not a friend and not speak woman ? 
we have no story to extract from them in ? 
you know , as a father and daughter have obligations , let me tell you all the parents , people were in the world and statistics that exist 危机感 , we &apos;re going to prevent them right . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be a very important way , i mostly say about my father . 
i think we should for our boys to show you a new manhood . 
now the manhood is defined by putting the cart before the horse . 
you already know new economic climate is changing men , women , his family home 胡口 role . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters , you know , she said , who ? 
wangari than 欧 ... 
wangari than 欧 -- well , the and 葛琳 sensing than 
what they have in common ? 
maybe like beautiful dress , no matter . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their own movies than others have more knowledge with others , and willing to share their knowledge that helped potential for other people . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i want my daughter has this hope for , his son has this pursuit . 
i hope this for more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism . 
i want to tell you a story about a little kid . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i knew his story . 
he lived in somalia in a small village 
it &apos;s very 加迪休 village from the capital . 
this little village , because it &apos;s been so drought 食不果腹 poor people . 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities . 
he got there , no , no , no prospects opportunities . 
and only lived in a tent that town in the country &apos;s 加迪休 . 
and the last year , it &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he had a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch . 
he discovered a bunch of people living , and he got off . 
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes can give their own native to send money . 
they give he introduced a young girl . 
and they did . 
he started new life . 
he lives have goals . 
in one day 加迪休 &apos;s in the sky 碧蓝 there was a car bombing . 
this is the city of my little boy is the suicide bombers , and it did help dynamic people are &quot; for youth &quot; party , and there &apos;s an al qaeda terrorist organization . 
this little boy just wanted to go through the city why through his story was a suicide attack for the end ? 
he actually wait . 
he was an opportunity for waiting his turn on a waiting for the future can move road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road . 
this is going to be like in 成年期 from his first encounter . 
and his story was over the world with different downtown . 
this is a story about power , taken from the urban youth unemployment story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out of things . 
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means job opportunities , wealth , but people didn &apos;t have to them in the city . 
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment . 
by 2030 , five people live in cities , there &apos;s three is 18 to these people . 
if we &apos;re developing cities of the young people don &apos;t think , of course , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for the 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and the gang 雷池 will be the future of cities . 
i was born in cities , more 加迪休 70 percent of people in unemployment . 
70 percent didn &apos;t work didn &apos;t read books . 
basically do nothing 
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and i met with 玛迪娜 hospital home that i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing that are full of play in front of an eye hospital , i think if i don &apos;t leave it would be ? 
if i have to get at the same waiting 成年期 ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
and i did say no . 
i came last month &apos;s 加迪休 reason to do is actually a young business leadership and the summit . 
i brought about 90 somalia to lead . 
we sat down and working together solutions to a city of the biggest problem . 
one in the room called aden young people . 
he &apos;s in the 加迪休 university and graduated . 
there was no job nothing . 
i remember i told him because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , it was very frustrated party &quot; for youth &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit . 
the people that look like this . 
but his story , it &apos;s another version 
in 加迪休 , it &apos;s from a to b to the biggest obstacle was the 
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , it actually became the easy-to-use tools . 
aden found opportunity and grab on it . 
he built a motorcycle company . 
started a motorcycle cab to the people who buy motorbikes . 
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆 
he &apos;s story of how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i believe is his and find opportunities to grasp opportunity . 
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is waiting for the most effective 成年期 . 
he drove young people become they had been crazy searching for economic opportunity makers . 
you can put people into training . 
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a conference he called doctor-heroes mohamoud is a 名花 business . 
he was helping me in training business summit part of the young people how to grow them how to create entrepreneurial innovation . 
if you ask people , &quot; you see the flowers , what is it ? &quot; for many was born in civil wars , who was their answer would be , &quot; never seen . &quot; 
so doctor-heroes from that opportunity . 
he created an 园林 greening and design and companies . 
he &apos;s in 加迪休 go out on a agriculture he started to grow and tulip 百合花 and he said that it had to make it &apos;s bad 加迪休 climate . 
and he started to build up on a wedding 家庭式 garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s the building &apos;s busy 加迪休 22年 to the first park citizens . 
there &apos;s no 加迪休 in today &apos;s citizens of the park . 
he wanted to create a space for young people together , family can here as he said , to feel and enlightenment 花香 rose . 
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire the young people and in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep . 
they don &apos;t want to business . 
they had to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he innovation for those people very big . 
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city . 
he makes them think they can also be entrepreneurs can be changing the world . 
and the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to solve the city of the most tricky issues right now . 
they came up with a business solution to local problems . 
so young companies to create a culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas . 
they need mentors expertise and guide development and take them on their business . 
for young people with the resources they need to give them support and helping them on the idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for cities 
for me , entrepreneurship is not on business 
it involves creating social impact . 
mohamed is not just in sells flowers 
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling . 
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , it will be truly change people to the city . 
side street aden hire him for a cab and help strengthen the motorcycle 
he gave them the opportunity to escape from waiting to escape from 成年期 unfortunate . 
these young entrepreneurs are for their cities have a profound impact . 
so my suggestion is that move more young people become entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have to spend more and more peace park story there rather than the car bomb 成年期 and wait . 
thank you . 
薛晓岚 : easy to learn how to read the chinese word for . 
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , my most precious memory is one of my mom for shows the chinese word for the beauty of form of care . 
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language . 
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to the wall of china 高不可攀 . 
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how we can tackle this wall , for those who want to understand and look at this complex language elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast , to help the chinese word for learning . 
from five , since i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book . 
fifteen years time , i everyday learning new the chinese word for . 
because we are only five minutes , hopefully for a much more easy faster way of learning . 
a chinese scholar 二万个 the chinese word for that . 
you just need to recognize the chinese word for years , it &apos;s simple read literature . 
that 二百个 the chinese word for the top , and you see it -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read and sign to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
today i use the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
put your mouth to a larger , the better , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words . 
this is a man was walking . 
&quot; one &quot; words . 
this is a tree . 
&quot; carpenter . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; signs , just like wild about comfort in a couple of cars on the door . 
i call this eight words for basic words . 
it &apos;s a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
&quot; a man . &quot; 
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
there is a saying that , people from two to three people , for the public . 
if somebody open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; the world , people were stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about get stuck in whales in the stomach . 
tree . &quot; &quot; a carpenter &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot; 
three trees together , is &quot; forests . &quot; 
take a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot; 
remember , because a very easy to talk to the trees are very 呆傻 things . 
remember &quot; fire ? &quot; 
&quot; 两团 fire &quot; together , it becomes very &quot; hot . &quot; 
&quot; 三团 fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much . 
it &apos;s two trees in the next , will &quot; burn &quot; . 
for us , everything from the sun &apos;s life . 
two together , the sun is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around . 
the sun three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot; 
when the sun and the moon in these together , and it &apos;s called the light . &quot; 
one day after a night , is &quot; tomorrow . &quot; 
from the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; 旦 . &quot; 
&quot; a door . &quot; and put the block of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot; 
take a 张嘴 on the door , is &quot; ask . &quot; 
&quot; bang ! &quot; , someone at home ? 
this is even outside , &quot; &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; escape . 
the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , maybe have debate . 
three women together , be careful , is &quot; and &quot; 姦 . 
we &apos;ve learned about the chinese word for 30 . 
and through this way , this basic eight words can secondary up into 32 the chinese word for . 
the next eight of the chinese word for the offspring , and the chinese word for 32 . 
so , you can really easy to learn the chinese word for hundreds of this is the chinese was eight children of chinese language . 
learning over those words , and we started to learn how to build a phrase . 
like , &quot; the mountain . &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcanoes . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot; 
we know that japan is the sun rises place . 
and here the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china . 
so the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot; 
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; man , we get what ? 
&quot; the japanese . &quot; 
the words of a hill , and those two are together . 
in the ancient china , which means 流亡 , because chinese clothes 政敌 to put in the mountain . 
nowadays , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go away . &quot; 
one of the word &quot; tells you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot; 
this slide reminds me , to finish , and walking down the table . thank you .
