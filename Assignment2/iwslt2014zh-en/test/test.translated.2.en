jay meg : why 30 20 is not new . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first patient needs a therapy . 
and i was a university in berkeley . they read in clinical psychologist students . 
she was a woman named alex 26 . 
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off the shoes , and she said to me , she told me to the men . 
when i heard this , i disengaged . 
one of my students , the first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk about my boys . 
i think i can deal with this thing . 
but i can &apos;t do that . 
alex in every meeting , all that funny story 点点 , so to me , and on the first time , and that &apos;s a very , very easily . 
alex would say , &quot; this is the new , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later to have to have children , even after all , there &apos;s only when death . 
and i was just like alex 二十几岁 except time out of nothing . 
but not too long , and i started to push it 催 alex love life . 
i refuse . 
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the bed dumb , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she may be one of these people and the wedding . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time is in the best before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists and said , &quot; so ! &quot; moment . 
in that moment , i learned that 30 二十岁 is not new . 
yeah , people and 安顿 later than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between 低谷 her development . 
and alex 二十几岁 to develop a good time , and we sat kill it . 
and i realized that oversight &quot; kindness &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for love , alex and her life 二十几岁 around for people with the family . 
now there &apos;s about the 5千万 二十几岁 . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can experience 二十几岁 stage in this case -- and adults . 
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand . 
i really wanted to see 一些二十几岁 here . 
that &apos;s great ! you are great . 
and if you work 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 , if you because of the people who lost 二十几岁 o , and i &apos;d like to see -- okay . awesome 二十几岁 people , very important . 
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime that 80 percent of the most important moment occurred in 35 years old . 
that means every 10 to your life is going to experience what it means &quot; ! &quot; moment that happened in eight of 30 中旬 . 
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago , and you will make a much bigger impact . 
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 终生 before , and got married , or partner 同居 on a date . 
we know in your brain 二十几岁 adults , for a second to adapt . it &apos;s a spike in the last time , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own , and what it is time for change . 
we know where life than other 二十岁 , some of the biggest change , and we also know that women have reproduction in the summit 28 years old , after 35 years old , and that &apos;s kind of hard to do . 
so you tell is this 二十几岁 between ourselves and in our bodies , to the future . 
so when we say children &apos;s development five years ago , we all know the language and admiration development is the critical period . 
this is a your daily life , you &apos;re going to have a huge impact on the future of the time . 
but we heard that less is something called adults 二十岁 development , and we developed this stage is the critical period for adults . 
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard . 
what newspaper in the adult 时间表 of change . 
the researchers were called 二十几岁 adolescence . 
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid , like , &quot; names , &quot; and &quot; adults and children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , we have to do is actually a decades of the most important 期中 doesn &apos;t matter . 
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , you need a plan and not enough time . 
this , right ? 
so when you take a 二十几岁 head , and people said , &quot; you have to start extra 10 years of life , &quot; what happens when you think ? 
nothing happens . 
you take that guy urgency , and worked , but nothing happened . 
and everybody says , &quot; i want to just before the 30 started my career . &quot; this is not a problem . 
but then they said , &quot; i start quickly 二十岁 over , but i didn &apos;t have to . 
i graduated from day one of my best 写写 . &quot; 
and they start : &quot; 二十几岁 date , like a seat in games . 
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but it &apos;s about 30 to stop it , you sit down to one after another . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i married my husband and i think the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently &quot; chair &quot; . &quot; 
二十几岁 here where people ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
well , you might have something that sounds 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , here &apos;s a currency . 
when things are going to do 三十几岁 in 30 , when you have this stage in a very short time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
these things don &apos;t have a lot of compatible , and just like that , to work on this stage 三十几岁 and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big . 
in the middle of a thousand years later , is not going to buy a red open buggy . 
that is not my job is to themselves . 
you can see is that you want to have kids , or your kids a people . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people with what we do . 
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do . 
this is a story about a story called emma women . 
emma 25 , because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent do at the . 
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she worked 脾气 show that the more and more than my boyfriend live together . 
and whether she 二十几岁 , how hard it is more difficult to her life . 
and when she was meeting , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walks in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took her to fill this morning , but she can only be looking for in the emergency situation , &quot; please call this &quot; -- the words of the space . 
the last 歇斯底里 she looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot; 
and i spent a lot of effort to avoid said , &quot; i &apos;ll . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment . 
emma need a better life , and i know that she &apos;s an opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , and i &apos;m not going to make a decision that emma 10 years that we do it . 
so in the next weeks and months , i taught in every three emma 二十几岁 people , both men and women , to hear . 
first of all , i told her forget emma identity crisis , and they started identity capital . 
i said , &quot; they identity capital &quot; meant value up for yourself . 
what do you think about this is going to be in . 
i didn &apos;t know emma career , and nobody knows the work of their future , but i know that there could be identity , to more identity capital . 
this is a professional multinational with that , in that space , and you want to step up to the time . 
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people , but i was exploring 漠视 meaningless exploration , and that &apos;s not going to go to explore . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trials of work and get them to count . 
secondly , i tell emma overestimate tribes , cities . 
the new capital , the new can almost always about out from the inside of the people at the community . 
we call the new things out of the weak to come , let &apos;s friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friend . 
yes , about half the people who never 二十几岁 or not full employment . 
but it &apos;s not about half the connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group . 
half of the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connecting to your neighbor as you get the job that was not 张贴 to work . 
this is not cheating . this is information about how to communicate science . 
and finally , emma that people don &apos;t have a choice family and friends . 
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as soon 一个二十几岁 , who &apos;s emma with someone 结伴 , to create a family to take her family . 
i tell emma choice family time is now . 
you might think , is a more than 20 , 30 , even better 25 , which is the next time , and i agreed . 
in other people , but when you start to marry auditorium , and you manage your sleep or 同居 people don &apos;t call progress . 
and in the best kung fu &apos;s marriage is time before married with love , which means that as rich as to work with that . 
there &apos;s family choices that you want to people , and that &apos;s not just to make that choice you succeed or and the waste of time . 
and how that emma ? 
well , it turns out that we address thin , and she found her a roommate had a family in another work in an art museum . 
the weak . she was there for a job . 
give her a job that she left he 同居 reasons . 
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and her a consciously chose people get married . 
she loved her new job , her love of his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 behind a big enough to 的卡 . &quot; pieces . 
emma story to this thing that sounds very simple , but this is my favorite 二十几岁 and the reason why people work . 
it &apos;s so easy to help them . 
just like 二十几岁 people out of los angeles international airport flights somewhere in the destination . 
and the fly , and it &apos;s a little further in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s the difference . 
likewise , or even is in 21 29岁 25 , a good , good time to rest , a good tedtalks can 对接 and a few generations , maybe even a very big impact . 
and to give a worth spreading , and you know who 二十几岁 ideas . 
and it &apos;s what i learned to alex as simple words . 
they don &apos;t know about you , or didn &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re going to your life . 
thank you . 
computer : 李镇河 李镇河 into : &quot; really &quot; infinite world , to your imagination . 
look at the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and 隔阂 digital information , and we have with virtual reality . gap between the virtual world , in our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , it &apos;s a gap is less than one millimeter , is the touchscreen glass and thin , so it &apos;s a computer all the people . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual reality , and the boundaries between good ? 
so i started to this crazy idea . 
the first thing i made that tool , it can number into space , if you take a pen that force on the screen , with a pen pen , and this is going into a little pixels of virtual worlds . 
designers directly in three-dimensional space to their ideas , the surgeon can practice on the screen for organs inside virtual surgery . 
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of boundaries . 
but we are in the hands out . 
how can we reach into a digital information and interacting , we have to use my hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentors 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space move into the number of jobs . 
because in the window and file a space , where they pick it becomes like a book with shelves from so easily . 
and you can read this book , and in each window &apos;s floating virtual out across the board of words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands stretched or by the model . 
in this case , that we &apos;re in the digital world . 
but how could it be to get into digital information into our world ? 
that &apos;s a lot of people in the shop and 退货 online experience . 
but now than you don &apos;t worry about . 
because i , here &apos;s an increase of 试衣间 online . 
this is the system , and the geometry of our bodies , and we drive through a or a look at the way that show us all . 
but , again , i started to think about this idea , how can we make the space that for a little pixels can touch it , to actually feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i had my mentor 石井裕 雷米 my partner , steve , the common material , &quot; make it a little pixels . &quot; 
in this case , this is like 磁体 spherical shape we like a 3d space of a computer , which means that this object and people will move into this little three-dimensional space 一三维 any place . 
so how do we eliminate gravity is , for a ball , and it &apos;s magnetically levitated . and drive the technology was on a ball together to control movement . 
by the number of programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , you can movement in the world of matter that can be recorded , the permanent and back . 
so it can be 编排 dance , and the real to teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 , and you can actually going to be repeated itself . 
you can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets , and different physical movement , the computer screen or textbooks , this is real learning , you can touch it , feel it , is to force . 
more exciting , it &apos;s not something that is to the computer into a real stuff , but programming world to imagine that we will transform even a regular physical activity . 
and as you can see , digital information . that &apos;s not going to give us , but we &apos;ll start acts as a part of our physical environment , and we don &apos;t cut to the real world . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can get a border , this is what we have enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
in the &apos; 70s , i had two 体操 湖南 learning . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years . 
when i was in elementary school , one grade , and i want to 转学 体校 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , and i want to 转学 体校 , all free . 
my mother said , &quot; no , the tiger . &quot; 
my parents , and i hope they as long as the engineers . i want my parents , as long as they are the engineers . 
as the 文革 , they only get -- think happiness is a good way of 高薪 . 
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter . 
but i dream is to be 黄梅戏 actor . 
imagine that i was playing the piano . 
little 戏曲 to learn from actor to actor 戏曲 身段 kung fu , started to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i wanted to do everything 黄梅戏 way to go to school . 
and he wrote to even 戏校 a radio host . 
but there was a big idea , like that . 
not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious . 
they just have my 小伙伴 for me , but they also as a child , and i powerless . 
when i was 15 , what &apos;s going to learn , much older . 
my dream is not going to do . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ! my god . 
ok , i decided to find another mission for themselves . 
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learned from the book . 
and the 三毛 南怀瑾 全集 &quot; and &quot; the history of my experience -- to the united states in 1995 , what i first read a book ? 
and of course , is the 禁书 . 
the earth is about &quot; the farmers . 
real to be propaganda . okay . 
bible interesting , but it &apos;s odd . 
他日 and talk about the topic . 
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my heart moving , &quot; a &quot; is not honor and more than &quot; submission . &quot; 
it &apos;s become my 儒家 负罪感 up out of the tools i climb up , it becomes 儒家 负罪感 tool to rebuild my relationship with their parents . 
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , you first saw this map , i think it &apos;s a strange , because this is the chinese students from big to use a map of the world . 
never before i realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily have to , in the world . 
this map , with a view . 
don &apos;t read a novel . 
it is , in academia standards . 
and even became a religious 比较文学 research . that &apos;s a religion , even 比较文学 that research . 
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding . contrast scholars to control for a project has a full understanding . 
and i wonder , if you have to work in reading , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ? 
so i started to read the book about it . 
they can be about the same -- different parties , they can be about the same -- different parties , or two friends have shared experience . 
what is the experience of politics and economics , mental experience is temptation , jesus , economic , political and spirit . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : social responsibility and desire , fear -- interesting . 
if you know , the book , and you want to compare the two language , which is very interesting . 
so thomas 默 . &quot; and &quot; the 庄子 阿伦 watts , &quot; the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost , i was one that we can bring to it . 
for example , is that i realized that the translator , &quot; happiness &quot; the chinese word for it could mean literally &quot; quick joy , &quot; well ... 
&quot; bride chinese word for the literal meaning &quot; it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
and i had become 今人 communicate with an amazing discovery , books . i had become 今人 communicate with an amazing discovery , . 
and let me alone don &apos;t feel helpless . 
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , it &apos;s not what 破灭 dreams . 
i started to realize that it &apos;s not the only purpose dream , i started to realize that dream is really the only purpose . 
it &apos;s the most important for us to touch that dream come from the places where , passion , happiness , the place . 
even a broken 灭 dreams , and you can experience the touch . 
because in this book , i &apos;m so happy to live life of purpose and meaning , to be clear , in most of the time . 
and you will never wish at any age . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
john 帕鲁尔 颂歌 塞加尔 : envy . 
when i was eight , to a new class in life , and she &apos;s compelling , like the girl to have a new way . 
she &apos;s a lot of the 光泽 秀发 a cute little 文具盒 specialize in a week in that . no one can than spell . 
that &apos;s the one year , i was until i was thinking of the evil . 
and one day i 逗留 from school , and it was to be the second night , i &apos;ve been silently sit on the toilet 
and one time , i have to go into the classroom teachers 出动 from the table for it . 
and i &apos;m a win by stopping . 
and i change my opponents scores only is it a little bit , and you put some 降级 . 
well , it &apos;s all a . 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other people &apos;s awfully have high score . 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all of the creative and nothing but . 
i gave all of the people in a row 等分 and myself in this because i &apos;ve got to do some more radical . 
i don &apos;t understand me . 
i don &apos;t understand where the idea is coming out . 
i don &apos;t know why they &apos;re very good . 
i was feeling great . 
i don &apos;t know why i never out . 
i mean , this thing to do so . 
i actually didn &apos;t get out ! 
but it &apos;s important , so why do i care about this girl , in this tiny little girl , and at the spell that ? i keep a time . 
and it &apos;s time . 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that &apos;s the pain of babies 
and that primate &apos;s going to a blue 知更鸟 envy . 
we know it &apos;s the united states are agents . 
but i never read a study to explain , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; lonely , or it &apos;s sort of devastation . 
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
well , i don &apos;t know it &apos;s not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have an ? 
if there &apos;s no 忠 of the sea , there is no odyssey . &quot; 
where there is no 妒忌 , king of the 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we have read 书单 high school , because we &apos;re losing the 喧嚣 are lost a &quot; and &quot; remarkable &quot; is the gates than the sun rises , &quot; are losing the 包法利 lady , &quot; &quot; anna 卡列琳 her . &quot; 
no , no 普鲁斯 jealous . now , i mean , i know people always say 普鲁斯 love , but said to know what &apos;s the thing he did it . 
and this is the 巨著 追忆 年华 一百周年 water , &quot; this work is to study the envy , as well , we can also think it &apos;s common 竞争性 that i was . 
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we think about the emotional . right ? 
we want to a small boy is 入梦 
in a piece of cake 玛德琳 薰 衣草茶 . 
we don &apos;t remember how he sharp eye . 
and how cool is compassion 
in these books , virginia , the gut 伍尔夫 with a cat . 
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it as 坚 顽石 . 
we look at these things together , so why would go on with envy . 合拍 novel 普鲁斯 , with envy . 
妒忌 desire , up to people , from a firm foundation . that &apos;s not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s a sensitive nerve to me , because we just need to think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we get jealous , we &apos;ll make a story . 
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they have to make is that we &apos;d suffered . 
the stories we tell ourselves as clear , and you know where to put in the details fatal 一刀 . right ? 
let &apos;s have a novelist 普鲁斯 amateur , but it can understand . 
all she did what i &apos;m happy to be happy people that it &apos;s happening now ? &quot; 
it was to create for themselves , and the story of the 普鲁斯 portraits , and he found a new lover . &quot; he &apos;s together as a tool of 密室 虐 . &quot; 
now we have to admit , 斯万 and there &apos;s two people 普鲁斯 infamous . 
you know , if they 普鲁斯 of my boyfriend , he &apos;s going to have 分手 from the country . 
but you don &apos;t have to admit that &apos;s what it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
let &apos;s body 疲 its time . 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , to get . 
envy like ? 
it &apos;s information . 
like . 
a lot like the 光泽 文具盒 秀发 cute . 
like envy . 
this is the reason that instagram . 
it will actually 普鲁斯 academic language 相联 with envy . 
when the of the envy of struggling to him , and he started standing in front of him to bribe 偷听 lover defense for these he servants &apos; quarters . 
he said , &quot; look , you know , i think this annoying , but it and interpret a 古文 or watching a memorial is two . &quot; 
he said , &quot; this is really a research , scientific knowledge of value . &quot; 
shame , grief , loss , these are 普林斯 , to wisdom . 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman and pain that we all emotions than for a genius , we &apos;re interested in what &apos;s more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel women ? 
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s . 
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotion would let &apos;s see , our own intentions ugly being heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that says that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 visit freud this youth who did that he and his wife and 憔悴 ours . 
freud that this guy kind of weird , because he doesn &apos;t really do focus on what his wife . 
because with his wife &apos;s , you know . 
this is the only guy to have any doubts 缘由 
but he was looking for his wife , some of the unconscious of is utter intend . 
she &apos;s laughing , or too 灿烂 . she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it &apos;s able to describe this novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right . 
well , it &apos;s more intense , we &apos;re more often . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something illegal or violence . 
it &apos;s going to become very extreme . 
i was eight years old , i think about that . but i also see on the news came up with a story . 
一个52岁 michigan that women are going to register a facebook account and used to account for their malicious year sending news . 
a year , for a year . 
she &apos;s trying to her before he 陷害 girlfriend . now i have to admit , when i heard it right , and she admired . 
because , i want to say , you face reality . 
ah , just how creative in the wrong place , right ? 
from this . &quot; 
a novel , 海史密斯 翠西亚 . 
and i love is 海史密斯 writers . 
she &apos;s in the united states and brilliant 文学史 诡 a page . 
tom , for example , in her , but the most famous character . 
you want to start 里普利 or what have you want to be , then you , and you have you ever have locked in his basement 应答 with you the names of the ring with you spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but we do ? we cannot do 里普利 . 
i don &apos;t have to change the world , even a day , i would have to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in admire . 
we live in envy . 
i mean , we are social media is good citizens , there &apos;s a trend , right ? 
we can give novel solutions , i don &apos;t know ? 
so we &apos;re going to see 学学 novel characters in it , they have to understand and the thing is , don &apos;t know how to do . 
let &apos;s go back to 贝克街 221 福尔摩斯 夏洛克 , ask the b . 
when people think that he would 福尔摩斯 opponent 里亚蒂 professor -- this genius . 
but i was more like an epidemic 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 头子 his face a scottish 福尔摩斯 is needed to him , but hate him . 
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this . 
he &apos;s 垂 雷斯 to help , and he hated the secret of the cases are 侦破 苦闷 story again . 
we proud of you . &quot; 
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold 福尔摩斯 . 
this is the way we see 福尔摩斯 少数几次 , was moved in , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it &apos;s like to as a geometry , instead of emotions . 
this one minute , standing 福尔摩斯 雷斯 垂 de opposite 
the next minute they stand in the same . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he was hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if it &apos;s a geometry , to do with a question of how we choose your relationship with other questions ? 
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent . 
we &apos;ll chase . 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction 
it &apos;s going on with envy fiction 
it &apos;s going to be novel domesticate to serve , please . 
it &apos;s called to get everybody 雷斯 垂 : cute , it &apos;s crazy , tom 里普利 millions , still , there &apos;s 马塞尔 普鲁斯 . 
we are so good . 
thank you . 
ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash . 
so when i was 10 , and a dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 . it &apos;s a mountain in the wild area in the new york . 
that is great . 
in places where the twinkling lights . 
when from the shine sunlight , like leaves , of colored glass 晶莹 feet . if you don &apos;t have a way , we think we can actually get to this place is the first human . 
and we went to our camp . 
that &apos;s on a cliff camp , to look at the beauty of a 水晶 晶莹 lakes , and i actually found a bad thing . 
in a camp behind , a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , very , very confusing . 
people to camp was too lazy to yourself , even the . they don &apos;t think anybody would up for them to clean 善后 ? 
and all this question bedeviled . i became a longer sound bite . 
and we have to leave the ? 
but you can put it in any problem . where you live in a 伊斯坦 we leave out the garbage ? 
we have in rio left in paris and london ? the ? 
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector , we have to leave the 000吨 11 , and the day of the 2000吨 recycled . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know who are doing this work . 
in the sanitation trucks were parked on this up in a sense of responsibility for what ? 
so i started the sanitation trucks were parked on a research project . 
i was sitting in the car , along the lines on the office in new york , all the sanitation trucks were parked people live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i really got the sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not sitting in , i open 垃圾车 垃圾车 . 
and in my own electric 扫帚 铲 its street , in the snow . 
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process . 
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell . 
there &apos;s a smell , but it &apos;s not that you want , bad smell , really smells pretty soon , but you will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even a few years of working side worker , their bodies have adapted to try and megatons of the week . 
so there is at risk . 
with the labor 统计局 report , the sanitation trucks were parked work is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then you figure out why . 
you all day in traffic , in the footprint . 
out of cars , you just trying to drive more people are not careful . 
in this case , the sanitation trucks were parked really bad . 
and what the itself is that often poisons 毒物 垃圾车 comes out from the terrible , to hurt . 
i also learned the devastation and frightening . 
when you &apos;re walking down the sanitation trucks were parked car 路沿 , in a city , you will look and see the really like the power of nature itself . 
it &apos;s never 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like , or a circular form . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked . 
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe is the city streets workers sanitation trucks were parked on the most important labor . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if they don &apos;t have a day , the most efficient way , sort of from the container itself , it will poison in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we attacked a century after 10 years 和数 outbreak of disease , back to our health threat . 
the sanitation trucks were parked 国民经济 need . 
if we don &apos;t throw away all the things that we have no space , something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less . 
i don &apos;t use capitalism , i &apos;m here is that they do . 
and the third reason -- that &apos;s what i call 经常性 , we have , the speed of activity . 
i mean , in the days and today , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , and it &apos;s clean and carried it around our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and they forget about it , and then it , because we know that there is a work in teams densest put these things were sitting over there . 
so today i want you to think that the sanitation trucks were parked situation , maybe . they &apos;re called to help them , to talk about how to create a sustainable city and the people . 
i think their work is really matters . 
and every time they really very to work on the street . 
in many cities they wear sanitation trucks were parked continues to work . 
you know , they have to clean the on time . 
okay , we can make them in their work . 
they almost became secure that work . 
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the and 糟粕 . this is going to work in need of stability . 
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and pull the young , i ran downstairs son . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 doing a week . 
i want to thank him do these work in that particular day , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy . 
his name is 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends . 
i want to believe that 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we , as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
and we know , the city of garbage actually only about three percent of all the trash . 
this is an amazing data . 
so in your life every day , in your life , into the next time you see somebody on the left out , when you ask them to find a time 致意 . 
a time to say thank you . 
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory . 
please close your eyes to me . 
imagine you &apos;re standing outside your door . 
please attention 一下门 materials , and the color . 
now , imagine a naked people on the overweight . 
going on a naked cycling to your front door , and make it . 
to try to imagine 近在眼前 alive . 
they &apos;re 奋力 , on the pedal 汗流浃背 颠簸 very 
and in your front door 径直 hit . 
go flying off that bicycle wheel 四下 as you go from a spoke into the roll of embarrassing . 
the threshold into 门厅 in the hallway and other parts of the soft comfort . 
on the sweet pastry light on . 
he was sitting in this horse is on the brown 骏马 马背 招手 to you . 
and the 马会 said . 
you can feel his nose 发痒 blue 鬃毛 for you . 
you can smell , he was thrown in your mouth 曲奇 granola grapes . 
around and around and into the living room . 
the living room standing on your imagination to imagine the 小甜甜 britney appeared . 
you exposed to wear her coffee table dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot; 
and i walked with in your kitchen . 
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 to get out your oven , you go to the track is &quot; 绿野 仙 dorothy 铁皮 in people with lions 稻草人 蹦蹦跳跳 walking arm in arm with their hands , to come to you . 
okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;m going to tell you about a year , spring in new york are going to do the unexpected . 
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 . 
a few years ago , as a journalist 科技类 reported this race to the thought that was about to be like &quot; super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot; 
a bunch of men and women and girls from 屈指可数 man and some people who don &apos;t notice 
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that had hundreds of the list . 
and trying to remember populations of strangers . 
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem . 
and in a very quickly , who can remember in the order of the 一整副 打乱 . 
and i thought it was amazing . 
there are other 禀 talent . 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training . 
i asked him , &quot; what are you ed , started to realize their memory is genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; i don &apos;t do . 
and my memory was . 
to this each one of them will tell you just average memory . 
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;ve never heard ? &quot; 
we stood outside the hall 过人 amazing and smart and a little bit weird british josh ed said to me , &quot; you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
&quot; 茫然不解 ? of course , i ask , why is this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio britney 一整副 打乱 remember what the sequence of . 
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me ! 
we had to find a person , why not ? &quot; 
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 out in front of me . 
most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about what other hidden , and what the potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he amnesia with his memory , like the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse is amnesia themselves don &apos;t remember it was amazing . 
and he &apos;s a tragedy role , but we can understand through his memory in any way to shape our personality . 
this is another extreme i met this one . 
his name is kim peek 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the movie &quot; rain man &quot; role . 
and he took one afternoon back in salt lake city public library , i think is just fascinating to phone books . 
and i went back home and i read a lot to write papers about memory 两千多年 ago in latin write papers until then , in the middle ages ancient 
i learned a lot of fun . 
one is to train illegal beam that memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 people want it to the memory of your own mind , 不遗余力 . 
these technologies for modern life possible , but we also change . 
not only in the culture , and i think in cognitive . 
kids don &apos;t need to remember that sometimes we have to remember how memory . 
in this place on earth are very few places where you can still think they may be interested in that beam that memory of an extraordinary memory . 
it &apos;s not so extraordinary to do this all over the world . 
i want to do with all these people know how to do . 
a few years ago london at the university of researchers asked to come up with a study memory . 
they want to understand the human brain , we do to others anatomically structure in different ? 
the answer is no . 
and they are smarter than us ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had negative . 
but compared with the goal is to control the brain and memory . there &apos;s a really interesting questions that are different . 
these are being sent to do functional mri brain scanner memory , when they &apos;re kind of digital or 人脸 or researchers found that memory up when there are the areas activated with people don &apos;t . 
notice that they use it in the brain in space and memory , it would have to navigate . 
why ? what can we have come from ? 
较量 竞争性 memory is a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective 赛场 memory to show that to catch up with other people . 
this is my friend ben pridmore won three international memory up there . 
he &apos;s 台前 三十六副 in order to his 打乱 card for an hour down with all that is the invention of his , he would have it . 
and in this way that he was not a bad word 4140个 back down to any one of binary . only half an hour . 
a cow . 
in the competition of 参赛者 using a lot of different memories are different ways to use all the skills to all of our into a code psychologists call &quot; fine . &quot; 
you can use this idea of a paradox of humor is perfect interpretation of simple baker / baker paradox is that i have two people to remember the word &quot; and i tell you a guy called baker . &quot; 
that &apos;s a baker . 
and i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; that &apos;s a baker . &quot; 
after a while back to you and i remember i said , &quot; before you remember the word is ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what words ? &quot; 
by the baker &apos;s 人名 that people remember that term for more than a baker being told that person . 
the word of different memories . 
why is it ? 
because there &apos;s no particular 人名 baker . 
you don &apos;t mind with complex little memory make any . 
but as a baker terms , you know , normally baker &apos;s . 
baker , with a white funny . 
and they &apos;re holding ourselves . 
they came home from work with a 扑鼻 toast . 
maybe some people have baker &apos;s friends . 
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to have all kinds of ways we can make it in a time can still remember . 
this exact 两千五百年 memory skills in the ancient greeks have before . 
and call it through . 
this invention there &apos;s a process of techniques called simonides following the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party 
and he was being asked to do that , because in the performing guest in the fancy party cool is not just d. j. to beat poet , but to reduction ode to . 
he stood up there with his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all the people who died . 
not all of them were all dead to come down on 面目全非 
nobody has said all the people who don &apos;t have to say some of you who &apos;s sitting 
the body can &apos;t get to the right place 殉葬 
and this whole thing reinforce the tragedy of color . 
simonides as standing outside of the site of the thrust upon close your eyes , he realized in front of his mind all 宾客 are sitting there . 
he was hold the hand relative to the site to bring their loved ones around . 
醒悟 simonides was thrust upon us about the things that you have probably guessed , whether it &apos;s actually not much we have to remember my phone number or . every that we all have the visual or space is exquisitely sensitive memory . 
i want you to recap 逐字逐句 , i just tell the story of simonides 10 years ago , a few people shouldn &apos;t have to remember . 
but i bet you now , if i put in the back of you sitting in the foyer . to speak brown 骏马 on who you know what i mean . 
this advice from the latin 两千多年 ago , the first . 
so this phrase . what ? 
if you were invited to stand on the ted stage , and you want to talk like 西塞罗 脱稿 2,000 years ago in rome in tedx talk on average 霸气 that he would go one , and you want . 
you can do is stand on their front . 
and then working with a complete picture of memorable like crazy to remind you to come up with the first thing is , it was creepy a ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry . ed , sitting on the back . 
this will remind you like to introduce your friends ed cook . 
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney of you would like to tell the story about britney 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to you about is the fourth spent a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 association can track 
this is going home talk reciting rome 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just the 添麻烦 reciting to remember , it &apos;s just one by one . 
and that phrase , &quot; which is from &quot; the word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is to talk about people 古时候 rhetorical , or in the space . 
the phrase &quot; means &quot; the palace 第一层 your memory . 
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started a more detailed 萌发 that it &apos;s about the memory . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is memory process is very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there . 
the most exciting moment , and it &apos;s not a small source 揉 揉 . 
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing ! 
i know that the human brain must be 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see as 外人 
i realized that if i really think about that you have to have that experience . 
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes to do something . 
put it back . 
i get back to back in the old 年鉴 跳蚤市场 in people . 
i was surprised to find it very 带劲 
don &apos;t want to try to surprise 
it &apos;s not a goal is to train memory . 
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working with that build your character is completely 胡乱 unforgettable images . 
and it became my . 
this is my competition memory , with a standard training suit . 
it &apos;s a whole 镜面 护目镜 耳塞 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the largest attention that is the enemy . 
and i went back to the story about a year ago 竞 赛场 . 
i want to drive a signed up for that as an experiment in the news . 
when i thought to be in the 前言 调侃 it yourself . 
the question is , experiment with the unexpected consequences . 
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
back to me now talk or shopping 稿 phone number one is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks memory works is because the human brain 依仗 them some basic principles . 
don &apos;t use it to build the memory card 几副 palace , or that you can also totally in order to understand how the brain and get some benefits . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think that other people &apos;s gift 禀 that is not . 
it can acquire the memory . 
from the fundamental 专心致志 can keep talking about . 
it was engaged to remember 
or the palace memory skills are just 捷径 memory . 
it can &apos;t be 捷径 on them . 
this work is because forces you to think about it . 
it forces you to go deeper , you want to be on most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to this training . 
it doesn &apos;t exist 捷径 
this is what we have to remember things . 
let me find my experience in our bodies 潜藏 with an amazing memory . 
but if you want to live memorable often do is to remember that memory . 
thank you . 
lee : -- who 沃斯 duke willpower the key to success ? 
on my 27th , when i left a very challenging -- to professional management company , turn it into a more challenging professional : education . 
i went to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math . 
the teachers and other students , i &apos;m going to do a little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
and when they open up their 试卷 , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst the only difference between the students . 
in some of the great 课业 that students don &apos;t have a very high iq points . 
some very smart , in the children are not so 课业 尽如人意 . 
this got me thinking . 
of course , students in seven grade need to learn something , it &apos;s like , a small percentage , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation . 
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , and they would spend time and effort . 
after a few years later , i have a classroom that in education , we need to learn from the perspective of psychology and students , to have a behavior and learn more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we know it , which is the best students , but if iq in schools and the good life do you rely on more efficient not easy to learn ? 
all i left school on stage , back to doing a master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids , and the people in the very challenging circumstances , and i study , where the question is , who &apos;s success , why do they do it ? 
and i went to my research group 西点 point , ok . 
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to live the training , which will be eliminated zone out . 
before we go to see the word competition , and also try to predict what kids can level-up at the end of the game . 
we look at work in hostile environment , just for the good teachers , the teachers would ask them to continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can improve quickly school students . 
and we asked them to cooperate , 私企 for what they can stay in . 
what can the more money ? 
in all the different context , a character that out , no one in which the promise of the big success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
no , it &apos;s pretty robust . it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is passion for long , and on . 
tenacity is a sustainable 恒 something happened . 
tenacity is on the next to you , every day is not just for a week or a month , but for a few decades trying to make their dream and reality . 
tenacity is to life as a marathon and it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in the public school , i started studying willpower . 
i &apos;m about to 初中生 千名 on the survey and willpower , waiting for more than a year , to look at the end to graduate students . 
all the point is not just in 西点 or the competition to build the words that willpower . this is also in school , especially in the dropout 徘徊 for the kids . 
for myself , for about willpower me the most incredible things is heading for willpower , we develop willpower , cognitive science , in the understanding that was how poor . 
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and how do they get a is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know , talented doesn &apos;t make you gritty heart . 
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , in terms of data , we usually willpower has nothing to do with other factors , even with the brilliance run counter to scale . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard about the kids to be resilient in the best way to grow , called &quot; mindset . &quot; 
so the stanford 卡洛杜 with a point , he &apos;s learning that people can be , as it changed the way to you . 
professor 杜威克 that , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain and its facing challenges , what happens is , they grow and more and keep going to fail , because they don &apos;t believe it would have failed . 
so , we grow up to develop willpower 大有裨益 mindset . 
but we need more . 
and so i decided i close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is working with the eyes . 
we need to get the best ideas , and the strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , to benefit from the experience from these fail again and again . 
in other words , we just have to become more willpower to our children to become more willpower . 
thank you . 
and the : 泽维尔 dimensions , into the building . 
as an architect , i was in architecture and design , it will take the environment , and around and around the building , and the environment , which is the relationship between tradition . 
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea . 
these two examples are emerging in a country , in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
in this case , two , one of the solution is design process , and it from multiple different from the perspective of architecture and design solutions , make the key components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall . 
this is my team and i was the same for example , we were asked to design it looks like . 
i first saw this feeling is , i don &apos;t want to do . 
in this kind of look at the same architecture of the city -- and there &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we found that the most important three questions . 
first , the building is basically empty , because they are a lot in store , people are not that big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to on the outside , because architecture is of course , the design to heat trapped in a building inside , so that we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in the city , because this is a city climate 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature 25度 左右. stable . 
the third problem is that the building a relationship with africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t . 
so for a cultural 底蕴 city , rich people , and it was called down . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , when i was so fascinated with the local 集贸市场 . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the built environment , in the hands of from 小商贩 to buy products . 
this is the same idea to me , is the outdoor public setting the idea of creating activities . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 this idea of building ? 
the second challenge is , when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the picture , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist . 
and this building on the before and after two years ago in parallel , streets don &apos;t have a little can 几百米 connected . 
so we need to do is we use all of the building that will be a portal , even the two together . 
and we have a gradient of 庭 design , create an open the space , and this design by its shape to avoid the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 . 
around these empty space , we sort out the little store , based on a small market town and the idea of the store . and that is used as a different shape , and not the same . 
i think the question is , how the building is the wall ? 
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the environment . 
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building . 
we from ethiopia beautiful women on the pattern of traditional dress got inspiration . 
some of these patterns in the geometry of the texture . i &apos;m like , of course the problems of the wall . 
we were using the walls are these little 预制 material , these windows to let the light and control in our way into the building . 
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use light source , inside the building up at night . 
these ideas , but we don &apos;t start building , and they moved to sort of , &quot; this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all know this , to design solutions than traditional mall solution to make more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop . 
and the design of the wall , down a lot of cost , because this is not just material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of air conditioning to control it . 
and we ended up saving part of the budget . 
the first stage , which is to think about how to make sure that the building in power , because we live in cities -- almost every day . the 闸 . 
so we were on the roof of the solar panels . 
and then we can think , on the roof , in the solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , to be here in cities , for people 小憩 oasis . 
on the roof of the 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to clean the building . 
we &apos;ve built in to the next year , we &apos;re 第五层 as well . 
the second example is to design a city tunisia 2000套 than collateral infrastructure and an apartment building . 
to scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i was really need to understand not only the tunisian city , and she also need to understand these kinds of tradition and culture . 
and in the process of my attention to be a arabs 聚居区 , this is a structure , over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure , there are 12 相互之间 , by the way it is connected to a straight line . 
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets , there will be a little basic 12 out there in size , and we sort of all the characteristics in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning . 
in the neighborhood , on the basis of any planning mentioned idea , we have a critical point , the key to connect with a straight line , to change a model . 
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , these kind of a cubicle , this is a fundamental part of the planning . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is the best them ? 
the answer is , you can use to 南北朝 南北 differences on either side of the house , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we do this pattern , and all of them have perfect apartment . 
this is the effect , as we design a city with work together , the combination of european style house . 
there &apos;s a garden with buildings , walk on the ground and around the whole sidewalks to connect . 
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the management agency , 上层建筑 population density of the population density , not very expensive . 
and she &apos;s all out for us to connect between 通性 portal . 
this is the roof of the project of my 得意 , it &apos;s like these buildings are going to be up to the space , and to the community . 
the community can climb up to the roof , my god , or poke somebody talk to make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , jump back and forth between or in architecture . 
in this case , there are two in the design process with the same way . 
again , they are in the city , you can see the little 拔地而起 building material . 
in the city , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the local communities and for the economic impact , to build a building as fast rate . 
for this reason , i think about this , in terms of architecture and design , which is , how important enough for cheap and simple solution to increase , and to the local people , and the relationship between the urban environments make people , and that &apos;s good to nature . 
thank you very much . 
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said that the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are repeats itself so often , in our society has become a cliche . 
i think that there are three things . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . it &apos;s a widespread consensus . 
the second one is : what we should have more 信任感 . 
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task . 
i think , for people to use this task , and that &apos;s all wrong . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is to use this task , and for a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ? 
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think that &apos;s really 信任感 down , but it was in some activity in some of the institution , or in other ways , and perhaps increase . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls , polls to find out about 信任感 in decline . 
but when you really look at different times polls , actually , not many evidence supporting this idea . 
so , in the last 20 years ago by the people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted . 
and that &apos;s been 20 years ago , people like trust and the nurse , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in the society who 居中 , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
polls records , of course , is that some people . 
or you can record polls ? 
but it &apos;s a general way , you ask them what they say . 
you trust their politicians ? trust ? 
if you asked , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot; 
fish trust you sell ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart the ask . 
when you understand what is the , you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
the answer is rational . 
now , in our lives , our reality in different ways to trust . 
we &apos;re not 信任感 level . we &apos;re going to do that certain types , the analysis . what official administration , and it will be kind of people . 
for example , of course , i would say , &quot; i know i believe in an elementary school teachers to teach them how to read , but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus . 
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers . 
i love that i believe , may drink to a friend &apos;s friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , he &apos;s a secret . 
it &apos;s that simple . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence is 信任感 from , say , well , we all do polls 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ? 
i think is a very bad polls 信任感 of measuring whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to think about 信任感 poor judgment . 
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ? 
it is , we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think that it was funny . 
i think it &apos;s not the purpose . 
people say , i &apos;m going to be more trusted not to trust , and trusted not to trust . 
in fact , i mean , it can &apos;t be trusted not to trust . 
for example , who put their savings that looks like it to where they are all the money to roll out 麦道 夫 people , and i think that people say , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s so easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
very smart and trust , to choose not to trust that &apos;s the purpose . 
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important not to trust , but reputation of ? 
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy . 
i think , to make decisions about the need for three . 
to see if they do ? it allows you to be honest ? good ? 
if we think is one allows you to , in his field allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe that they can trust , because they are . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have a good friend honest , but i believe it or not , and they sent me to help , because they &apos;re forget it . 
my friend , some very confident that they can do it , but i think some of them too confident . 
of course , i &apos;m glad that allows you to my friends are not good , it &apos;s not very honest . 
maybe there is , i &apos;ve never found . 
is this : we need trust to look at before his reputation of . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the system , is to be a professional level , or whatever it was making it easier for us to determine whether a reputation . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that . 
and i remember a 助产士 my talk , and she said , &quot; you see , now the problem is that i &apos;m going to do a 接生 手续 than what it was a child . &quot; 
in our public institutions , our lives in life , we found a lot of questions . ask to have these institutions in the system to protect his reputation as can be trusted by the rules are often see it &apos;s the opposite . 
it allows people to work on their 助产士 , for example , they put them in time to waste 填表 . like i just mentioned . 
you actually had this experience . 
a lot to talk about it . 
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , an attitude , not all of you here . 
and thirdly , the task . 
this is called a reconstruction 信任感 . it &apos;s got the . 
and i give you the task to restore trust . 
well , we can do for ourselves . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but what &apos;s the matter is unique , trust . it &apos;s from each other . 
you can &apos;t fix people say to you . 
you need to make any 家信 people trying to get you . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful around , and you know , people are trustworthy . 
how to do that ? 
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it works . 
i give you just a simple , for example , the marketing . 
there is a store to buy that i can go back to me , they never ask any questions . 
and they take 退货 退货 , i will give me , or change color is my favorite socks . 
it &apos;s good . i trust they asked me , because they think they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very good to trust myself . right ? it &apos;s confidence . 
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell . 
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
科林 托克斯 : the movies , manhood . 
as the father , and i was happy to see your film . 
i like to share it with my kids in the movie , when my daughter , four , and together we saw the track 仙 绿野 . &quot; 
and then a few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
and it &apos;s like getting yourself as 仙女 魔杖 was holding . 
but when you look at the 几遍 , and then you see this film is so special . 
now , we live , raise kids , it &apos;s a fantastic children into the complexity of the world . 
but the track 仙 绿野 独树一帜 . &quot; 
it &apos;s not like that . 
this is the trend in 40 years later today , that &apos;s another interesting movie , it has an iron 大个儿 and a guy 毛绒绒 enemy to mimic the safeguard to save a girl . 
you know , that &apos;s what movie ? ... 
right . 
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different 绿野 仙 to the track , &quot; we see all the film in recent years 两三 . there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first of all , &quot; no &quot; 绿野 仙 spaces in violence . 
it &apos;s the kind of violence and , for instance , like this . 
but i think if we are tracking 仙 绿野 film , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz predictions of people . 
use your magic slippers 巫婆 to beat the military . &quot; 
but that &apos;s not like that . 
the unique 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; sex and the image of the most heroic , even bad guy , who are women . 
i was in a few years later , together with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized that time , this is a slightly different . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
it was three . 
he was too small , so we don &apos;t see his name . 
but as a second child , his family to watch it &apos;s sort of a lot . 
and he went in , and it &apos;s a mystery in the duck as small as a duck mother was born , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , obviously , but he was there . 
and i &apos;m curious why like this film . 
it &apos;s a film about courage and willpower and faithful ? 
also , or 卢克 joins the army remove the government ? 
&quot; 一下1939年 versus 绿野 仙 spaces . &quot; 
dorothy is to win ? 
and she told everybody to be a good friend into their leaders . 
and i hope to our children in this environment -- oz up , and the world -- not to beat up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality . 
why do we give children have so many movies , violence , little yellow brick way ? 
about men &apos;s violence , the impact of women in movies a lot of this analysis , you should look at articles written . good . 
a lot to affect boy , i read the article , not so much . 
and my own experience , for the environment are 从莱娅 experience , i actually got to be in real life into adults to children &apos;s &quot; the adult world 混居 of men and women . &quot; 
i think the screen should happen in the beginning of the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
i won , mission accomplished 芳 heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t know what to do . 
this film to focus on that beat the bad guys , that no matter how much time with other and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re boys , you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be in 战袍 . 
of course , there &apos;s an example , in front of you and i &apos;m going to defend the princess disney . 
but these movies for boys . they didn &apos;t expect that the audience . 
a lot of these films , all because it &apos;s a church . how girls 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society . 
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 . 
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , like this and kevin 赫敏 特里斯 mental image of the characters , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i recommend to all of you are now in the movie . project . 
you remember the brave legends criticism , &quot; just project ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 and to do the movies . &quot; 
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , the movie all by 贝克德 test , &quot; no . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
this test for not today , but you know , maybe we can do them . 
alison 贝克 德尔 , is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , and she was recorded that with a friend in and they saw the movie about it . 
very simple , only three questions : this is a film that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
think about the standard . 
if , female characters in movies are talking about ? 
if you talk , they have in common 心上人 to talk about it ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women , to have to speak , there . 
it &apos;s like this . i saw the movie , but we &apos;ve seen in love with the movie is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a movie 阿尔戈 good quality . &quot; 
oscar for the movie , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film , the story of what &apos;s happening in the event has been hijacked 人质 使馆 in big , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see , for men to be in that scene in a conversation with the anxious . and one of the movie actor , the nice story is the door and said , &quot; sleep is , honey ? &quot; 
this is hollywood . 
look at statistics . 
2011 in front of the most popular 100部 movies , how many film a heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
but just pick a percentage of parliament women parliamentarians in terms of scale , it &apos;s good . 
and that &apos;s the higher than that , and that &apos;s going to shocked in this room . 
last year , new york times published a paper done by government . 
here &apos;s content . 
the united states every five women in a 性骚扰 ever met . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s in entertainment , had wrong . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s due to a child . 
i even think porn music and movie with it , but certainly not where to go wrong . when i hear the statistics , i was thinking about the number of 性骚扰 , is it so much . 
who are they ? they teach them how to be ? 
they leave school ? 
they don &apos;t have to understand a movie of the story , a man hero beat 残暴 反派 and get the glory and reward -- and there &apos;s a woman who didn &apos;t speak ? 
we have to learn from the story of what ? 
you know , as a father and daughter to have , i tell you all the parents , people like this to save the world and statistics , we &apos;re going to be in 危机感 prevent them . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be a very important is the way , i said to him . 
i think we should for our boys to show you a new manhood . 
now as manhood &apos;s putting the cart before the horse . 
you know the new economy environment men , women are changing the role of his family 胡口 at home . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters who she said , you know ? 
wangari -- than 欧 
wangari 欧 -- well , the more than about 葛琳 and 
what they have in common ? 
maybe it &apos;s no relationship with the beautiful . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their own film that has more than others , and knowledge with others to help people share their knowledge for potential . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i hope that &apos;s my daughter , and try to my son &apos;s pursuit of this . 
i hope this for more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism . 
i want to tell you a story about a little kids . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know him . 
he lived in a village in somalia . 
it &apos;s from a village 加迪休 capital . 
this little village , because it &apos;s been so drought 食不果腹 poor people . 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities . 
he had the opportunity , no , no , no prospects . 
and only lived in the town in the country &apos;s 加迪休 . 
last year , and it &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he had a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch . 
he &apos;s alive with a bunch of people , and he got off . 
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes , can give their own native to send money . 
and to give him a young girl . 
and they did . 
he started a new life . 
he &apos;s life . 
there &apos;s 加迪休 one day in the sky 碧蓝 happened a car bombing . 
this is the city of my little boy is that the bomb , and when that help dynamic people , &quot; is &quot; the party and al qaeda had a terrorist organization . 
this little boy , just to go through the city is through his story in the end for suicide attacks ? 
he actually wait . 
he was an opportunity for the future of waiting for him to move to a road , and this is the first time he had to go . 
this is going to be like in 成年期 from his first encounter . 
and he was in the same story in the center of the world . 
it &apos;s about being from the power of the story of the city , unemployment . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 started riots in london riots 成年期 started to get them out . 
for young people , cities with dreams , it means to 大城市 job opportunities , wealth , but they don &apos;t have to people in the city . 
more , and for the young people in unemployment . 
in 2030 , five people live in cities , there &apos;s three is under 18 to people . 
if we &apos;re not going to the city of young people think , of course , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities for you come across this story 成年期 terrorism and violence and the gang 雷池 to the future of cities . 
i was born in the city , who &apos;s unemployed in 加迪休 70 percent . 
no , no book 70 percent . 
basically do nothing 
it &apos;s a month i went back and i met with 玛迪娜 加迪休 that i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing that are playing with the eye hospital , i think if i don &apos;t leave it be ? 
if i get to in the same for 成年期 ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
and maybe i did . 
last month &apos;s 加迪休 because i got to do is actually a business leadership and the summit . 
i brought about 90 of leadership in somalia . 
we sat down and working together , they have a solution to the biggest problem . 
one of the room called aden young people . 
he &apos;s in the 加迪休 university and graduated . 
there was no job , nothing . 
i remember i told him because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , &quot; the party of frustration &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit . 
the people that look like this . 
his story , but it &apos;s another version . 
there &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and most of the is . 
23 years of civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and this is actually a really easy-to-use tools . 
and on that aden opportunities to it . 
he built a motorcycle company . 
a cab actually started to the people who buy motorcycle 
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 dreams , and he &apos;s in the next three years to expand 数百辆 
he &apos;s the story of how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
and i believe , is going to find opportunities and opportunity . 
this is entrepreneurship and i believe 成年期 entrepreneurship is waiting for the most powerful . 
and he drove all crazy in young people become economic opportunity for makers . 
you can put people into training . 
i want to tell you about a man who had to , i have a meeting his name is a mohamed mohamoud 名花 business . 
he was trained in business to help me on the summit of how they train people how to create entrepreneurial innovation . 
if you ask people , &quot; you see the flowers , what ? &quot; for a lot of people who was born in civil war , they will answer is , &quot; never seen before . &quot; 
so mohamed from that opportunity . 
he started a 园林 greening and companies and design . 
he &apos;s 加迪休 go out on a piece of agriculture , and he started to grow tulip 百合花 and he said that it &apos;s a bad 加迪休 to climate . 
and he started to build up on a wedding in 家庭式 garden in business , and now he &apos;s busy . it &apos;s built the first citizens 加迪休 22年 park . 
now , there &apos;s no 加迪休 &apos;s citizens in the park . 
he wanted to create a space for family , young people together to here , as he said , to inspire and feel 花香 rose . 
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire people in the room , and mohamed for young people here at the very deep . 
they don &apos;t want to business . 
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he innovation to those people very big . 
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city . 
he makes them that they can be entrepreneurs can be changing the world . 
and the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now . 
they came up with a business solution to local problems . 
so that people are creating culture is big step across , but people need money to make their ideas . 
they need guidance and expertise and take them up on their business . 
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them to create change from the idea is that you create a catalyst for the city . 
for me , is not on a business . 
it also create social impact . 
it &apos;s not just in sold doctor-heroes 
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling . 
his name is peace park , he took the building , and it will really change the meaning of the city of people . 
side street aden hire him for a cab and maintain that actually help . 
he gave them the opportunity to was for was to get 成年期 . 
these young . they have to have a profound impact on the city . 
so i was working with more people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more for peace and park there is not the story of the car bomb 成年期 and wait . 
thank you . 
the chinese word for 薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read . 
i grew up in taiwan as a 书法家 . my daughter , one of the most precious memory for my mom &apos;s shows the chinese word for the beauty of care about . 
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language . 
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to the wall of china 高不可攀 . 
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how to tackle this wall , and to understand that language and look at this complex elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new way , quickly learn the chinese word for it . 
from five , i started to learn how to draw the sequence of writing , every one of the chinese word for . 
and i was 15 years , the chinese word for learning new every day . 
because we have five minutes , just one more time to be a simple way to learn faster . 
a chinese scholar 二万个 the chinese word for that . 
you just need to know , the chinese word for a thousand simple can read literature . 
the top , and the chinese word for 二百个 that you see it -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read and sign to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
and i &apos;m here today with the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
you have the mouth of a larger , the better , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words . 
this is a man was walking . 
&quot; one word . &quot; 
this is a tree . 
&quot; wood . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; signs like wild about comfort in a car on the door . 
i call this &quot; for basic , eight . 
it &apos;s a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
&quot; a man . &quot; 
if you go on the other one , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
a phrase from one to two , three , for the people . 
if somebody open arms , and people said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
&quot; to &quot; and &quot; man in the world , people were stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about it being trapped in the stomach . 
that &apos;s a tree . &quot; &quot; carpenter &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; the . &quot; 
three trees together , is &quot; the . &quot; 
put a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot; 
very easy to remember , because a tree , it &apos;s going to talk about 呆傻 . 
remember &quot; fire ? &quot; 
&quot; and &quot; 两团 together , it becomes very &quot; hot . &quot; 
&quot; and &quot; 三团 together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much . 
it &apos;s two trees in the next , &quot; burn . &quot; 
for us , life is everything from the sun . 
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around . 
the three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot; 
when the sun shines , together , and the moon , which is &quot; light . &quot; 
one day and night , which is a &quot; tomorrow . &quot; 
on the horizon is from the sun rises . &quot; 旦 . &quot; 
a &quot; in the door . &quot; and put a piece of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot; 
&quot; bang ! &quot; , someone at home ? 
this is even outside , &quot; and &quot; our &quot; 躲闪 . &quot; 
on the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , maybe have debate . 
three women together , be careful , &quot; it &apos;s 姦 . &quot; 
we &apos;ve learned , the chinese word for 30 . 
the way through eight , it can basically the chinese word for word up into 32 offspring . 
the chinese word for eight of the crime , the chinese word for 32 out there . 
so , you can really easy to learn the chinese word for hundreds of china was eight , that &apos;s the children of the chinese language . 
these words in school , and we started to build a phrase . 
for example , the &quot; to &quot; and &quot; and &quot; together , we have &quot; volcano . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot; 
we know where the sun rises was japan . 
and here the sun 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china . 
so the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot; 
in the japanese &quot; and &quot; a &quot; people , we get what ? &quot; 
&quot; the japanese . &quot; 
&quot; the mountain , and there are those two together . 
china , in the ancient world , because it means 流亡 政敌 in china , the clothes out to them . 
today , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; came out . &quot; 
&quot; and &quot; a word out where you say , &quot; is export . &quot; 
this slide , it reminds me of the talk , and walking down the table . thank you .
