jay meg : why is not the new 20 to 30 
when i was in my in the very first , i saw my client psychotherapy . 
ph : i was a student in clinical d. psychology at berkeley . 
she was a -- -- 26 year old woman named alex . 
now alex walked into her first session slouchy wearing jeans and a big top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and flats kicked off her and she told me to talk about guy there was problems . 
now when i heard this , i was so relieved . 
my classmate got an arsonist for her first client . 
and i got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about who . 
i thought i could handle this . 
but i didn't handle it . 
with the stories that funny alex would bring to session easy for me , it was just my head nod to the can while we kicked down the road . 
&quot; the new 20 thirty's would say , &quot; alex , and as far as i could tell , she was right . 
marriage happened happened work later , later , later , evan death happened kids later happened . 
and i had twentysomethings like nothing but alex time . 
but before long , my supervisor pushed me to push alex about love her life . 
i pushed back . 
i said , &quot; sure , she's dating she's down , but with a knucklehead sleeping , that &apos;s not going to marry she's like the guy . &quot; 
and then my supervisor said , &quot; might not yet , but she marry the next one . 
besides , the best time to work on alex's marriage is before she has one . &quot; 
that's what psychologists call an &quot; aha ! &quot; moment . 
that was the moment i realized , 30 is not the new 20. 
yes , people settle down later than that , but they used to make the didn't alex's in a developmental downtime . 
that made a developmental alex's 20 the sweet spot watch , and we were sitting there blowing it . 
that was when i realized that this was a sort of benign neglect call real real , and it had consequences , not just for her life and alex but love for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere . 
there are 50 million twentysomethings in the united states right now . 
we're talking about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you consider that no one's adulthood without getting through their going through the first 20 . 
raise your hand if the you're in your 20 . 
i really want to see some twentysomethings here . 
oh , yay ! y'all's awesome . 
if you love , you work with a twentysomething twentysomethings you're losing twentysomethings sleep , over , i want to see -- okay . awesome , twentysomethings really matter . 
this is not my opinion . these are the facts . 
we know it that 80 percent of defining life's most moments 35. take place by age 
that means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and &quot; aha ! &quot; moments that make your life is what it will have happened -- 30 the mid by your . 
people who are over 40 , don't panic . 
this is going to be fine crowd , i think . 
we know it that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential you're impact on how much going to earn money . 
we know it that are more than half of americans are married with or living by their future or partner 30. dating 
we know it that the brain and its last second caps off in your spurt growth in it for itself as the rewires adulthood , which means that whatever you want to change it is about yourself , now is the time to change it . 
we know it changes your personality that during the 20 more than at any other time in life , and we know it female fertility peaks at that age , and things get 28 tricky 35. after age 
so your 20 the are the time about yourself to educate your body and your options . 
so when we think about child development , we all know it that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain . 
&apos;s a time , when your ordinary life -- day to day -- inordinate has an impact on who you will become . 
but what we hear about that is less there's such a thing as the adult , and our development that are the critical period of adult development . 
but what this isn't twentysomethings are hearing . 
talk about changing the newspapers of timetable adulthood . 
the researchers in the call an extended adolescence . 
silly for nicknames journalists coin twentysomethings twixters &quot; like , &quot; and &quot; kidults . &quot; 
&apos;s true . 
we have as a culture , what is actually the defining trivialized decade of adulthood . 
leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time . 
isn't that true ? 
so what do you think happens when a twentysomething you pat on the head and you say , &quot; you have 10 extra years to start your life ? &quot; 
nothing happens . 
the person that you have robbed ambition and urgency , and his absolutely nothing happens . 
or they say , &quot; everybody says as long as i get started by the time on a career , 30 i'm i'll be fine . &quot; 
but then it starts to sound like this : &quot; s are almost 20 my over , and i have nothing to show for myself . 
i had a better r é sum é the day after i graduated from college . &quot; 
and then it starts to sound like this : &quot; dating in my was like 20 the musical chairs . 
and everybody was running around having fun sometime around 30 , but then it was like the music started turned off and everybody sitting down . 
i want to be the only didn't one left standing up , so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest to me at 30. chair . &quot; 
where are the twentysomethings here ? 
do not do that . 
okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high . 
when a lot has been pushed to your 30 , there is the enormous pressure thirtysomething career -- jump to start a partner , a city , pick up , and two or three kids have much shorter in a period of time . 
many of these things are incompatible , and as research is simply just starting to show , and more stressful harder to do our all at once in the 1930s . 
the post millennial -- midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car . 
you have can't &apos;s career realizing that now you want . 
that &apos;s realizing you now have can't child , you want your child or can't give you a sibling . 
too many fortysomethings thirtysomethings and look at themselves , and at me , sitting across the room , and say , &quot; s in their about what was i doing ? what was i thinking ? &quot; 
i want to change what twentysomethings are thinking and doing . 
here's a story about how that can go . 
&apos;s a story about a woman named emma . 
emma at 25 , because she came to my office was , in her words , having an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment , but yet , so she decided hadn't she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead . 
because it cheaper , she was a boyfriend who lived with his more than his displayed temper ambition . 
and as hard as her in her life were the early , had been evan harder . 
she cried often in our sessions , but then would collect herself can't by saying , &quot; you pick your family , but you can pick your friends . &quot; 
well , one day she comes in and emma hangs her head in her us , and she sobbed for most of the hour . 
the address she'd just bought a book , and spent she'd filling in the morning , but then her contacts many she'd been left empty blank staring at that comes after that , &quot; in case of the words , please ... emergency call . &quot; 
she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said , &quot; who's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck ? 
who's going to take care of me if i have cancer ? &quot; 
now in that moment , it took everything i had not to say , &quot; i will . &quot; 
but what emma wasn't therapist who needed some really , really cared . 
emma needed a better life , and i knew this was her chance . 
i had learned since i first too much worked with alex to just sit there while emma's defining decade parading went by . 
so over the next weeks and months , i told emma three things that every male and female , or twentysomething deserves to hear . 
first , i told emma to forget about having an identity crisis identity and get some capital . 
by get identity capital , i mean value to do something that adds who you are . 
do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next . 
i know it the future of emma's didn't career , and no one knows the future of work , but i do know it : this identity capital begets identity capital . 
so now is the time -- for that job , that cross country startup internship , that you want to try . 
not i'm discounting twentysomething exploration , but here i am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration . 
that's procrastination . 
i told emma to explore and make it work count . 
second , i told the urban tribe is that emma overrated . 
best friends are great for giving rides to the airport , but who twentysomethings huddle -- like together with minded limit peers who they know it , what they know it , how they think , how they work , and where they speak . 
that piece of the capital that the person to date , almost always comes from outside the inner circle . 
what are the things come from our ties called weak , our friends of friends of friends . 
so yes , half of twentysomethings un -- or under -- are employed . 
but half aren't ties weak , and how are you get yourself into that group . 
half of the jobs are never posted , so neighbor's reaching out to your boss is how you get posted un -- that job . 
&apos;s not cheating . the science of how &apos;s information spreads . 
last but not least , emma can't believed that you pick your family , but you can pick your friends . 
now this was true for her for a twentysomething up , but as soon emma would pick , when she partnered with her family someone and created a family of her own . 
i told the emma time to start picking your family is now . 
now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better than the time to settle down , or evan 25 , and i agree with you . 
but whoever grabbing you're or sleeping with living on facebook with when everyone starts walking down the aisle is not progress . 
the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one , and that means love as intentional as being with are you work with . 
consciously picking your family is about choosing who and what you want it rather than just killing time making work or whoever choosing happens to be with you . 
so what happened to emma ? 
well , we went through that address book , and she found an old cousin roommate's who worked at an art museum in another state . 
weak tie that helped her get a job there . 
it &apos;s her job offer that to leave the reason that global live -- in boyfriend . 
now , five years later , a special she's events planner for museums . 
she married to a man she's mindfully chose . 
she loves her , she loves her new career new family , a card sent me and she said , &quot; now that the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough . &quot; 
now that sound made emma's story that's easy , but what i love about working with twentysomethings . 
they are so easy to help . 
just like twentysomethings airplanes are leaving for somewhere , bound lax west . 
right after takeoff slight change in a course , is the difference between landing or alaska in fiji . 
likewise , at the eg 25 or 29 , or one conversation break one good , good , good ted talk , one can have an enormous effect evan across generations to come and years . 
so here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know it . 
what &apos;s as simple as i learned to say to alex . 
what &apos;s now i have the privilege of twentysomethings emma like saying to every single day : thirty is not the new 20 , so some claim adulthood , get your capital , use your identity , weak pick your family ties . 
be defined by don't didn't didn't or what do you know it . 
your life you're deciding right now . 
thank you . 
lee : jinha into the computer reach and grab a pixel 
throughout the history of computers we &apos;ve been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen can go wild where our imagination . 
and this gap has become shorter , evan shorter shorter , and now , and this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter , the thickness of a touch screen -- glass , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone . 
but i wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ? 
i started to imagine what would look like this . 
first , which i created this tool penetrates the digital into space , so when you press it hard on the screen , or its body into physical transfers pixels . 
their ideas can designers materialize directly in 3d , and surgeons can practice virtual underneath organs on the screen . 
so with this tool boundary , this has been broken . 
but still remain our two hands outside the screen . 
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full of dexterity our hands ? 
sciences applied at microsoft , along with my mentor cati redesigned boulanger , i turned the computer and a little space above the keyboard workspace into a digital . 
by combining a transparent and display cameras for sensing depth and face your fingers , now you can lift up your hands from the inside this keyboard and reach and grab pixels 3d space with your bare hands . 
because files windows and have a position in the real them , space is as easy as selecting a shelf grabbing off your book . 
then you can flip through this book highlighting words , while the lines on the virtual below tool the tedpad . touch each floating windows . 
architects rotate the models can stretch or two directly with their hands . 
so in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world . 
but how about reversing role and having its reach us instead the digital information ? 
i'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online . 
but now don't you have to worry about it . 
what i got here is an online augmented fitting room . 
this is a view that you get from head -- or display mounted see through the system -- when understands the geometry of your body . 
taking this idea further , i started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it so physical and feel that we can touch it ? 
what would such a future look like ? 
at mit , the media lab because my advisor , along with my collaborator rehmi hiroshi ishii and post , we created this one physical pixel . 
well , in this case , this magnet spherical acts like a pixel in 3d space , which means that our computers and people can move both this object to anywhere within this little 3d space . 
what we did was essentially canceling &apos;s gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and sensing and actuation mechanical technologies . 
and by the programming digitally object , we are liberating object from the constraints of time and space , which means that can now be recorded , human motions and played back and left permanently in the physical world . 
so can physically be taught choreography over distance and michael jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality . 
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex motion as such planetary concepts , physics , and unlike screens or computer textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience and you can feel that touch , and &apos;s very powerful . 
and more exciting than just turning what's what's physical currently in the computer programming is to start imagining how the world will alter our physical evan daily activities . 
as you can see , the digital information will not just show us directly something but it will start acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world . 
today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary boundary , the only left is our imagination . 
thank you . 
lisa bu books : how can open your mind 
so i was trained to become a gymnast hunan for two years in the 1970 , the in china . 
when i was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer for me to a school athletes , all expenses paid . 
but my mother said , &quot; no tiger . &quot; 
my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them . 
after surviving the cultural revolution , they only believed firmly there's one sure way to happiness : well -- and safe paid a job . 
it is not important if i like the job or not . 
but my dream was to become a chinese opera singer . 
that is me playing my imaginary piano . 
an opera singer must learn to start training young acrobatics , so i tried everything i could opera to go to school . 
i wrote to the school principal evan and the host of a line at radio show . 
but no adults liked the idea . 
i was no serious believed adults . 
me only supported my friends , but they were kids , as i was just as powerless . 
so at age 15 , i knew i was too old to be trained . 
would never my dream come true . 
i was afraid that for the rest of my life would happiness -- some second class , i could be the best hope for . 
but so that's unfair . 
so i was determined to find another calling . 
nobody ? fine to teach me around . 
i turned to books . 
&#91; &quot; complete works of sanmao &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; lessons from &quot; by history nan huaijin &#93; i came to the u . s. in 1995 , which did so first i read books here ? 
books banned in china , of course . 
earth &quot; &quot; the good life is about peasant chinese . 
not just that's convenient for propaganda . got it . 
the bible , but is interesting strange . 
that's a different topic for a day . 
but it &apos;s the fifth commandment me an epiphany : &quot; you shall honor your mother and father . &quot; 
&quot; honor , &quot; i said , &quot; that's different , and so , better than obey . &quot; 
so it becomes my tool to climb out of this guilt confucian restart trap and to my relationship with my parents . 
culture encountering a new habit of my comparative also started reading . 
it offers many insights . 
for example , i found this map out of place at first because this is what chinese students grew up with . 
it had never occurred to me , china doesn't have to be at the center of the world . 
actually carries a map somebody's view . 
comparative reading is actually nothing new . 
a standard &apos;s practice in the academic world . 
there are such as research evan fields comparative religion and comparative literature . 
compare and contrast scholars gives a more complete understanding of a topic . 
so i thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ? 
so i started reading books in pairs . 
so they can be about people -- &#91; &quot; benjamin franklin walter isaacson &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; by john adams &quot; by david mccullough &#93; -- who are involved in the same event , or shared experiences with friends . 
for the christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual . 
for the buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty -- interesting . 
so if you know it &apos;s also a foreign language , your favorite fun to read books in two languages . 
&#91; &quot; the way of thomas merton chuang tzu &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; tao : the watercourse way alan watts &#93; instead of &quot; lost in translation , i found there is much to gain . 
for example , i realized that &apos;s through translation , &quot; happiness &quot; in chinese literally fast means &quot; huh ! &quot; joy . 
&quot; means &quot; in chinese bride literally the &quot; mother . &quot; uh -- oh . 
books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present . 
i know it , i shall never lonely or feel powerless again . 
having a dream is really shattered nothing compared to what many others have suffered . 
i have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream . 
most important its purpose is to get in touch with us where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from . 
evan shattered a dream that can do for you . 
so because of books , happy i'm here today , again , living with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time . 
so you may be always with books . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
parul sehgal : an ode to envy 
so when i was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be . 
she had vast quantities of very cute little shiny hair and a pencil case , super state capitals on strong , just a great speller . 
and i just curdled jealousy with that year , until i plan my hatched devious . 
so one day i stayed late after a little school , a little too late , and i girls' lurked in the bathroom . 
when the coast , clear , i was emerged crept into the classroom , and took teacher's grade the desk from my book . 
and then i did it . 
i fiddled rival's with my grades , just a little demoted , just some of those a &apos;s . 
all of those a &apos;s . 
and i got the ready to return to the book , drawer hang on , when my classmates of some other appallingly too had good grades . 
so , in a frenzy , i everybody's marks corrected , not imaginatively . 
everybody : it &apos;s a row of d's and i row of a &apos;s , it &apos;s a myself , just because i was there , you might know it , as well . 
and i still am baffled by my behavior . 
i understand where the idea don't came from . 
i understand why i felt so don't great doing it . 
i felt great . 
i understand why i was never don't caught . 
i mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious . 
i was never caught . 
but most of all , i am baffled by it did , why bother me so much that this little girl , this tiny , little girl was so good at spelling ? 
jealousy baffles me . 
so , that &apos;s mysterious and &apos;s so pervasive . 
we know it babies suffer from jealousy . 
we know it . do primates are actually very bluebirds prone . 
we know it that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states . 
and yet , i have never read a study that can its loneliness to parse me or its its grim thrill or longevity . 
for that , we have to go to the novel fiction , because that is the ; jealousy has studied in every possible configuration . 
in fact , if i don't know it &apos;s an exaggeration to say that if we have didn't jealousy , we would have eg literature ? 
well , &quot; no , no helen faithless odyssey . &quot; 
&quot; no , no jealous king arabian nights . &quot; 
no shakespeare . 
there goes high school we're reading lists , because the fury losing &quot; sound , &quot; and &quot; losing we're gatsby , &quot; &quot; also sun rises , &quot; &quot; madame bovary we're losing , &quot; &quot; anna king . &quot; 
no , no proust jealousy . and now , i mean , i know it &apos;s fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything , but in the case of jealousy , he kind of does . 
this is the year of centennial masterpiece , his in search of &quot; lost time , &quot; and &apos;s the most exhaustive study of sexual competitiveness and just regular jealousy , my brand , that we can hope to have . 
and we think about proust sentimental , we think about the bits , right ? 
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep . 
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea . 
we forget was how harsh his vision . 
we forget how pitiless he is . 
i mean , these books are tough virginia woolf said that were as cat gut . 
i know it don't gut cat , but what is formidable let's &apos;s assume . 
look at let's why they go so well together , and the novel , jealousy and proust jealousy . 
is it something as jealousy , which as obvious that person , boils down into desire , impediment narrative , is such a solid foundation ? 
i know it . i think it don't cuts very close to the bone , because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous . 
when we feel ourselves jealous , we tell a story . 
we tell ourselves a story about people's other lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible . 
as the tale of the teller , and the audience just what we know it , to dig details to include in that knife . right ? 
makes us all amateur jealousy novelists , and this is something proust understood . 
she does everything that gives me pleasure that could be giving somebody else about pleasure , maybe right now . &quot; 
and this is he starts to tell the story himself , and from then on , every fresh proust writes that detects in his mistress swann charm , &quot; he adds to his collection of instruments in his private torture chamber . &quot; 
and now swann proust , we have to admit , were notoriously jealous . 
proust's boyfriends , you know it would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him . 
but you have to be don't jealous concede that that &apos;s hard to work . right ? 
jealousy is exhausting . 
emotion . it &apos;s a hungry must be fed . 
and what does jealousy like ? 
jealousy likes information . 
jealousy likes details . 
the vast quantities of jealousy likes shiny cute little hair , the pencil case . 
jealousy likes photos . 
why that's instagram is such a hit . 
actually the language of links proust scholarship and jealousy . 
when swann is in his throes jealous , and suddenly he's listening at bribing and his mistress' servants doorways , he defends these behaviors . 
he says , &quot; look , you know it , you know it , i think this is repugnant , but it is no different from an ancient interpreting text or looking at a monument . &quot; 
he says , &quot; they are investigations with real intellectual scientific value . &quot; 
grief , loss , humiliation avenues to : these were the proust for wisdom . 
he says , &quot; whom we need a woman , makes us who suffer from us , elicits a gamut of feelings and far more profound than vital genius of a man who interests us . &quot; 
he is telling us to just go and find cruel women ? 
no . i think he's trying to say that jealousy ourselves reveals to us . 
and any other emotion does crack open us in this particular way ? 
does any other emotion us to reveal our hideous aggression and our ambition and our entitlement ? 
does any other teach us to look emotion with such peculiar intensity ? 
freud would write about this later . 
one day , freud very anxious was visited by this young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him . 
and freud , says something about this guy &apos;s strange , because what he's not looking at his wife is doing . 
everybody knows because she's blameless ; it . 
the poor creature is just for suspicion under no cause . 
but looking for things that he's his wife , without unintentional noticing is doing behaviors . 
is she too smiling brightly accidentally or here , she did brush up against a man there ? 
&#91; the &#93; freud says that man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious . 
the novel is very good on this point . 
the novel is very good at how describing jealousy trains with us to look not but intensity accuracy . 
in fact , the more we are intensely jealous , the more we become residents of fantasy . 
and this is why , i think , jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do things or violent illegal things . 
jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive . 
now at eight i'm thinking of myself , i i'm concede also , but i heard this story of thinking on the news . 
52 -- a year old woman was caught michigan -- creating a fake facebook account from which she sent vile hideous messages to herself , for a year . 
for a year , a year . 
and she was trying to frame ex boyfriend's her new girlfriend -- and i have to confess , when i heard this , i just reacted admiration with . 
because , i mean , let's be real . 
what if , creativity , immense misplaced . right ? 
this is something from a novel . 
this is something from a patricia highsmith novel . 
now is a particular highsmith favorite of mine . 
she is the very bizarre and brilliant woman of american letters . 
tom ripley , take her most famous character . 
now , tom ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being what you and having had , and once you you're , under the floorboards he's answering to your name , he's emptying wearing your rings , your bank account . 
that's one way to go . 
but what do we do ? we can't go the tom ripley route . 
i give the world d's can't , as much as i really would like to , some days . 
and &apos;s a pity , because we global live in envious times . 
we in global live jealous times . 
i mean , we're all good citizens of social aren't we , the media , where the currency is envy ? 
does the novel show us a way out ? i'm not sure . 
so what do characters let's they're always do when they are not sure , when in possession of a mystery . 
b 221 let's go to baker street and ask for sherlock holmes . 
when people think of holmes , they think of his being nemesis michael moriarty professor , right , this mastermind criminal . 
but always i've inspector &#93; &#91; preferred lestrade rat , who is the head of scotland -- who faced yard holmes , desperately needs holmes' resents genius , but needs him . 
oh , that &apos;s so familiar to me . 
so , his resents lestrade needs help him , and sort of seethes bitterness with over the course of the mysteries . 
we're proud of you . &quot; 
and he says that not there's at a man who want to scotland yard wouldn't sherlock holmes' shake hand . 
&apos;s one of the few times we see the mysteries holmes moved in , and i find it very little moving , this scene , but also &apos;s mysterious , right ? 
it seems to treat as a call geometry of jealousy , not emotion . 
one minute holmes , you know it is on the other side from lestrade . 
the next minute they're on the same side . 
suddenly , lestrade is letting himself he's resented this mind admire that . 
it could be so simple though ? 
what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ? 
well , maybe then we have to resent wouldn't somebody's excellence . 
we could align ourselves with it . 
but i like contingency plans . 
so while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for consolation . 
fiction demystifies jealousy alone . 
it invites domesticates fiction alone , it to the table . 
and it gathers : who look lestrade sweet , terrifying tom ripley , crazy , marcel proust swann himself . 
we are in excellent company . 
thank you . 
robin nagle : what i discovered in new york city trash 
about 10 years old , i was on a camping trip adirondack with my dad in the mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state . 
it was a beautiful day . 
the forest was sparkling . 
the sun made the leaves glow like stained glass , and if it were weren't for the path we pretend following almost , we could we were the first ever walk that human beings to land . 
we got to our campsite . 
it was a bluff -- to lean on a beautiful , looking over a crystal lake , when i discovered a horror . 
behind the lean to was a dump -- maybe 40 square feet , with apple rotting cores and balled aluminum foil -- up , and a dead sneaker . 
and i was astonished , i was very angry , and i was deeply confused . 
the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in , who would think they did after clean them up ? 
stayed with me that question , and it a little simplified . 
who cleans up after us ? 
however you configure or wherever you place the us , who in istanbul cleans up after us ? 
who cleans up after us in rio or or in london in paris ? 
here in new york , the department of sanitation cleans up after us , to the tune of 11 , 7,000 tons of garbage and two , 7,000 tons of recyclables every day . 
i wanted to get them to know it as individuals . 
i wanted to understand who takes the job . 
what's it like to wear the burden uniform and bear that ? 
so i started a research project with them . 
i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed in offices and facilities people all over the city , and i learned a lot , but still , i was an outsider . 
i needed to go deeper . 
so i took the job as a sanitation worker . 
i just didn't ride in the trucks . now , i drove the trucks . 
and i operated brooms and the mechanical plowed : the snow . 
it was a remarkable education and an amazing privilege . 
everyone asks about the smell . 
but there &apos;s not as &apos;s prevalent , as you think , and on days when it is really bad , you get used to it rather quickly . 
the weight takes a long time to get used to . 
i knew people who were on the job several years still were adjusting whose bodies to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week . 
then the there's danger . 
according to the bureau of labor statistics , sanitation work is one of the most dangerous 10 occupations in the country , and i learned why . 
you're in and out of traffic zooming &apos;s day , and all around you . 
it just wants to , so you get past the motorist &apos;s often is not paying attention . 
that's really bad for the worker . 
and then the garbage itself is full of hazards often that fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm . 
i also learned about the relentlessness of trash . 
when you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck , you come to understand that the force is like a trash nature unto itself . 
it never coming stops . 
&apos;s also like a form of respiration or circulation . 
it must be always in motion . 
and then there's the stigma . 
i find the stigma especially ironic , because i believe strongly that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city , for three reasons . 
they are the first use guardians of health . 
if not taking away they're effectively and efficiently trash every day , it starts to spill out of its inherent containments , and the dangers us very threaten to it in real ways . 
we &apos;ve had in diseases check for decades and centuries burst forth us to harm and start again . 
the economy needs them . 
if we throw out the old stuff can't , we have no room for the new stuff , so then the engines of the economy is to start when sputter consumption compromised . 
i'm advocating i'm capitalism , not just pointing out their relationship . 
and then there's average , what i call our quotidian necessary velocity . 
i mean by simply how fast that used to we're contemporary moving in the day and age . 
we usually don't care for , repair our , clean , carry around our coffee cup , shopping bag , our bottle of water . 
we use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know it there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away . 
so today i want to suggest a couple of ways to think about that will help ameliorate sanitation perhaps the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft is that a sustainable city and humane . 
their work , i think , is kind of liturgical . 
on the streets they're rhythmically , every day . 
they wear a uniform in many cities . 
when you expect them to know it . 
and their work lets us do our work . 
they are almost a form of reassurance . 
they maintain the flow that keeps us safe , from ourselves from our own dross cast , our -- offs flow , and must always be maintained that no matter what . 
on the day after september 11th , 2001 , i heard in the growl sanitation of a truck on the street , and i grabbed my son and i ran downstairs infant there was a man and his paper route doing recycling every wednesday like he did . 
and i tried to thank him for his work on that day doing all of days , but i started to cry . 
and he looked at me , and he just nodded , and he said , &quot; we're going to be okay . 
we're going to be okay . &quot; 
it was a little while later that i started my research , and i met with sanitation man that again . 
his name is paulie , and we worked together many times , and we became good friends . 
i want to believe that paulie was right . 
we are going to be okay . 
but in how we reconfigure our effort to exist as a species on this planet , we must include and take account of all the costs , including the very real human cost of the labor . 
municipal waste , what we think of garbage , when we talk about three percent of the accounts for nation's waste stream . 
&apos;s a remarkable statistic . 
so in the flow of your days , in the flow of your lives , next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after , you take a moment to acknowledge them . 
take a moment to say thank you . 
joshua foer : anyone can do feats of memory 
i'd like to invite you to close your eyes . 
imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your running . 
i'd like you to notice the color of the door , the material that &apos;s made out of . 
now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles . 
they are competing race naked in a bicycle , and they are headed straight for your front door . 
actually , i need you to see this . 
they are really hard , they're pedaling sweaty , they're bouncing around a lot . 
and they crash straight into the front door of your running . 
bicycles fly roll past wheels , everywhere , you end up in places spokes awkward . 
step over the threshold of your door , your into your foyer whatever's hallway , on the other side , and appreciate the quality of the light . 
the light shining on cookie monster is down . 
cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan le horse . 
&apos;s talking a horse . 
you can feel his blue fur practically tickling your nose . 
you can smell the oatmeal raisin that cookie he's about to shovel into his mouth . 
. him walk past past him walk into your living room . 
in your living room , in full picture , britney spears broadband imaginative . 
she is scantily clad she's dancing , on your coffee table , and hit me singing &quot; baby she's one more time . &quot; 
and then follow me into your kitchen . 
okay . open your eyes . 
i want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in new york city . 
the united states called &apos;s championship memory . 
and i had gone to cover this contest as a few years back expecting a science journalist , i guess , that this was going to be like the superbowl of savants . 
this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies , both in age and widely varying upkeep hygienic . 
they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once . 
they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers . 
they were poems memorizing entire in just a few minutes . 
they were competing to see who could memorize the order of a pack of playing cards shuffled the fastest . 
i was like , this is unbelievable . 
people must be these freaks of nature . 
and i started talking to a few of the competitors . 
this is a guy called ed cook over who had come from england where he had one of the best trained memories . 
and i said to him , &quot; ed , when did you realize that you were a savant ? &quot; 
and like , &quot; i'm ed was not a savant . 
in fact , i have just an average memory . 
everybody in this contest competes who will tell you that they have just an average memory . 
and i was like , &quot; whoa . how come before i never heard of this ? &quot; 
and we were standing outside the hall competition , and ed , who is a wonderful , brilliant guy , but somewhat eccentric english , says to me , &quot; an american , josh you're journalist . 
do you know it britney spears ? &quot; 
like , &quot; what i'm ? no . why ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really want to teach britney spears how to memorize the order of a pack of playing cards shuffled u on national television . s. . 
it will prove to the world that anybody can do this . &quot; 
i was like , &quot; well , but not i'm britney spears maybe you could teach me . 
i mean , you've got to start somewhere , right ? &quot; 
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me . 
i ended up spending the better part of the next year , not only my memory training investigating , but it also trying to understand how it works , why it sometimes doesn't work and what might be its potential . 
i met a host of really interesting people . 
this is a guy called e. p . 
who had an he's amnesic , possibly the very , very worst memory in the world . 
his memory that he was so bad evan didn't call remember he had a memory , which is amazing . 
and he was this incredibly tragic figure , but he was a windows into the extent to which our memories make us who we are . 
the other end of the spectrum : i met this guy . 
this is kim peek . 
he was the basis for dustin hoffman's character in the movie &quot; rain man . &quot; 
we spent an afternoon together in the salt lake city use memorizing library , which was scintillating phone books . 
and i went back and i read a whole host of memory , treatises treatises written two plus -- 10,000 years ago in latin in antiquity and then later in the middle ages . 
and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff . 
one of the really interesting things that i learned is that once upon a time , this idea of having a trained , disciplined cultivated memory , was not nearly as it would seem so alien to us to be today . 
once upon a time , people invested in their memories , furnishing laboriously in their minds . 
these technologies have made possible our modern world , but also they've changed us . 
they've culturally changed us , and i would argue that they've cognitively changed us . 
having little need to remember anymore , it seems like we &apos;ve forgotten how sometimes . 
one of the last places on earth where you find people still passionate about this idea of a trained , memory , disciplined cultivated is totally singular contest at this memory . 
that &apos;s actually not held singular contests , there are all over the world . 
and i was fascinated , i wanted to know it , how do these guys do it . 
a few years back , a group of researchers at university college london a bunch of memory brought into the ; champions . 
they wanted to know it : do these guys have brains that somehow , structurally anatomically are different from the rest of ours ? 
the answer was no . 
they are smarter than the rest of us ? 
it &apos;s a bunch of them they cognitive tests , and the answer was not really . 
there was really interesting one however and telling the difference between the brains of memory control champions and the subjects that they were comparing to them . 
when they put these guys in an fmri machine , scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's pictures of faces and snowflakes that memory , they were found champions lighting up the different parts of the brain than everyone else . 
the note , they were using , or they seemed to be using , a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation . 
why is there something ? and the rest of us can learn from this ? 
the sport is memorizing the competitive driven by a kind of arms race every year where somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly , and then the rest of the field catchup has to play . 
this is my friend , ben pridmore time -- three world champion memory . 
on his desk in front of him playing are 36 shuffled packs of cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour , using a technique that he invented and he has mastered alone . 
he used a similar precise technique to memorize the order of four , 140 random binary digits in half an hour . 
yeah . 
and while there are a whole host of ways of these competitions , remembering stuff in everything , all of the techniques that are being used , ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding . 
and illustrated by a nifty &apos;s well known as the paradox of baker baker paradox , which goes like this : if i tell people to remember the same two word , if i say , &quot; you to remember that there is a guy named baker . &quot; 
his name that's . 
and i say , &quot; you to remember that there is a guy who is a baker . &quot; 
and i come back to you at some point later on , and i say , &quot; do you remember that word that i told you a while back ? 
do you remember what it was ? &quot; 
the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker . 
same amount of different word , remembering ; that's weird . 
what's going on here ? 
well the name baker doesn't actually mean anything to you . 
it is entirely untethered memories from all of the other floating around in your skull . 
but the common noun bakers baker , we know it . 
wear bakers funny white hats . 
have bakers flour on their hands . 
good smell bakers running when they come from work . 
maybe we know it a baker evan . 
and when we first hear that word , we start putting it hooks into these associational that make it easier to fish it at some date back out later . 
one of the techniques for doing more elaborate dates back about this , 500 years to ancient greece . 
it came to be known as the palace memory . 
the story behind its creation goes like this : there was a poet called simonides who was attending a banquet . 
he was actually the entertainment hired back then , because if you wanted to throw a party , you really slamming didn't hire a d. j. , you hired a poet . 
and he stands up , his delivers walks poem from memory , out the door , and at the moment he does , the banquet , inside a collapses kills everybody . 
it just doesn't collaborators at kill everybody , or the bodies mangles beyond all recognition . 
nobody can say , who was inside nobody can say where they were sitting . 
the bodies can't properly be buried . 
another one &apos;s compounding tragedy . 
simonides , standing outside , the sole survivor amid the wreckage closes his eyes , and has this realization , which is that in his eye mind's , he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting . 
and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides each them to their loved ones amid the wreckage . 
if i asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story that i just told you about simonides , chances are you would have a tough time with it . 
but i would wager that if i asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a tan le talking horse foyer in your right now , you would be able to see that . 
this is advice that goes back 10,000 years -- two plus treatises memory to the earliest latin . 
so how does this work ? 
say that let's you've been invited to ted center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory , and you want to do it the way that it would have done cicero if he had been invited to tedxrome two 10,000 years ago . 
what you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house . 
and you'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy , ridiculous , unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this bizarre totally contest . 
and then you'd go inside your house , and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed . 
and that would remind you that you would want to introduce your friend then ed cook . 
and then see an image of you'd britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote want to tell you . 
and you go into your kitchen , and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange you journey that went on for a year , and you have some friends to help you remember that . 
this is how roman orators memorized speeches -- not their word for word -- -- which is , you just going to screw up , but -- -- for topic topic . 
in fact , the phrase , &quot; that sentence &quot; topic comes from the greek word , &quot; which means &quot; topos &quot; place . &quot; 
when a that's vestige of people and oratory used to think about these sorts of rhetoric in spatial terms . 
the phrase &quot; in the first place , like &quot; that's in the first place of your memory palace . 
i just thought this was really fascinating , and i got into it . 
and i went to a few more of these contests memory . 
and i had this notion that i might write something longer memorizers subculture of competitive about this . 
but there was a call . 
that was the call a memory is a contest pathologically boring event . 
and it truly is a bunch of people like taking the sats sitting around . 
i mean , the most dramatic starts when it gets their massaging is somebody temples . 
and i'm a journalist , i need something to write about . 
i know it that there's this stuff happening in these incredible people's don't minds , but i have access to it . 
and i realized , if i was going to tell this story , i needed to walk in their shoes , a little bit . 
and so i started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times just trying to remember something . 
maybe it was a poem . 
maybe it was from an old yearbook names that i bought at a flea market . 
and i found this shockingly that was fun . 
i never would have expected that . 
it was fun because this is actually not about training your memory . 
what is doing you're you're trying to get better and better and better at , at creating these utterly ludicrous dreaming , up , and hopefully , raunchy hilarious mind's unforgettable images in your eye . 
and i got pretty into it . 
this is me my training wearing standard competitive memorizer's kit . 
&apos;s a pair of safety and a set of earmuffs goggles masked that have been over two , except for small pinholes because distraction is the greatest competitive memorizer's enemy . 
i ended up coming back to that same covered contest that i had a year earlier . 
and i had this notion that i might enter it as an experiment , sort of participatory in journalism . 
make it'd , i thought , maybe a nice epilogue to all my research . 
the experiment was call went haywire . 
i won the contest , which really wasn't supposed to happen . 
now it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping &apos;s lists , but actually kind of beside the point . 
these are just tricks . 
because they are tricks based on that work they're some pretty basic principles about how our brains work . 
and you have to be building don't or memory palaces packs memorizing the playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works . 
we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift , but that is not the case . 
great memories are learned . 
at the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention . 
we remember when we are deeply engaged . 
the memory , these techniques memory palace , just they're shortcuts . 
in fact , not really evan they're shortcuts . 
they work because they make you work . 
they force , a kind of depth of processing , a kind of mindfulness , that most of us around exercising don't walk normally . 
but actually there are no shortcuts . 
how is this stuff is made memorable . 
i learned that there are incredible firsthand memory capacities latent in all of us . 
but if you want to global live a life memorable , you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember . 
thank you . 
angela lee : the key to success duckworth grit ? 
when i was 27 years old , i left a very demanding for a job in management consulting job that was demanding more eg : teaching . 
i went to teach math seventh graders use in the new york city schools . 
and like any teacher , and i made quizzes tests . 
it &apos;s out i homework assignments . 
when i came back , the work calculated grades . 
what struck me was that was i.q. is not the only difference between my students and my best worst . 
some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric i.q. is scores . 
some of my kids smartest weren't doing so well . 
and that got me thinking . 
the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math , hard : sure , they're ratios , decimals , the area of a parallelogram . 
but these concepts are not impossible , and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough . 
after several years of teaching more , i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective , from a psychological perspective . 
in education , the one thing we know it is to measure how best i.q. is , but what if in school and doing well in much life depends on your ability to learn more than quickly and easily ? 
so i left the classroom , and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist . 
i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings every study , and in my question is , who was successful here and why ? 
my research team and i went to west point military academy . 
we tried to predict cadets would stay in which military training and which would drop out . 
we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict farthest in which children would advance competition . 
we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , which still asking teachers are going to be teaching in here by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be improving the most effective at learning outcomes for their students ? 
we partnered with private companies , asking , which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs ? 
and the most who's going to earn money ? 
in all those different contexts , one very characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success . 
and it wasn't social intelligence . 
it looks good wasn't , physical health , and it wasn't i.q. is 
it was grit . 
passion is grit and perseverance for very long term -- goals . 
grit is having stamina . 
grit is sticking with your future , day in and day out , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make a future that reality . 
grit is living life &apos;s like a marathon , not a sprint . 
a few years ago , i started studying the chicago use grit in schools . 
i asked to juniors thousands of high school , and then take questionnaires grit waited around to see more than a year who would graduate . 
turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate evan , when i matched them on every characteristic , i could measure things like income family achievement test scores standardized , how evan felt safe , when they were kids at school . 
so &apos;s not just west point at the national spelling bee or grit matters . that &apos;s also in school , especially for kids at risk for dropping out . 
most shocking to me , the thing about grit is how little we know it , how little knows science , about building it . 
every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; how do i build grit in kids ? 
what do i do to teach a solid work ethic kids ? 
how do i keep them motivated for the long run ? &quot; 
the don't honest answer is , i know it . 
what do i know it is that you make gritty doesn't talent . 
our data show that there are many clearly very talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments . 
in fact , in our data , grit is usually evan inversely related or unrelated to measures of talent . 
so far , the best idea i've heard about building in kids grit growth is something called &quot; mindset . &quot; 
this is an idea developed by carol dweck at stanford university , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change your with effort . 
dr : dweck has shown that when kids learn and read about the brain and how it grows and changes in response to challenge , much more likely to persevere they're when they fail , because they believe that don't failure is a permanent condition . 
so mindset growth is a great idea for building grit . 
but we need more . 
and where that's i'm going to end , because my remarks that's where we are . 
the work that that's stands before us . 
we need to take our best ideas , our intuitions strongest , and we need to test them . 
we need to measure whether we &apos;ve been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start with lessons learned over again . 
in other words , we need to be grittier gritty about getting our kids . 
thank you . 
xavier vilalta : running at its community in architecture 
my work focuses on both the connection of our community life thinking about being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions . 
today i brought two recent projects as an example of this . 
projects are emerging in both countries , one in ethiopia and another one in tunisia . 
and they also have in common that the different from different perspectives analyses becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture . 
the first example started with an invitation to design a shopping mall multistory ethiopia's in addis ababa capital city . 
and this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design . 
at first , the first thing i thought was , i want to run away . 
after seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have very big three points . 
first , these empty buildings , they are almost because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things . 
second , they need to perform tons of energy because of the skin treatment with glass in the heat that creates inside , and then you need a lot of cooling . 
in a city where this really happen because they have shouldn't mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year . 
and third is their image that has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia . 
it is a pity in such a place that has rich traditions and culture . 
also during our first visit to ethiopia , i was really captivated merkato by the old air is that this structure -- open thousands of people , where they go and buy small vendors things from every day . 
and it has also use this idea of the space that uses the outdoors to create activity . 
so i thought , this is what i really want to design , not a shopping mall . 
but the question was how we could do a building , contemporary multistory with these principles . 
the next challenge was when we looked at the site , that is , in a really for area of the city , where most of these buildings that you see in the image , they were not there . 
and also parallel between two &apos;s streets have any don't that connection for hundreds of meters . 
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building . 
and this with an inclined extends atrium -- that creates an open space in the air that protects self -- building with its own shape itself from the sun and the rain . 
and we placed around this void this idea of the shops with small market , because that change in each floor of the shape of the void . 
i also thought , how to close the building ? 
and i really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local conditions climate . 
and i started thinking about the textile like a concrete perforations made with the shell that would let in the air , and the light , but also filtered in a way . 
and then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the ethiopian women's dresses . 
they have properties that fractal geometry and this whole helped me to shape the facade . 
and we are building with these small pieces that prefabricated let that are the windows that light in the air and the way a controlled inside the building . 
and this is by these small complemented colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night . 
these ideas with first it was not easy to convince the developers because they were like , &quot; this is not a shopping mall didn't . we ask for that . &quot; 
but then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall basically because they had to sell more shops . 
and also the idea of the facade that was much , much cheaper , not only because of the material compared with the glass , but also because we need to have air conditioning didn't anymore . 
so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project . 
and the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building sufficient self -- in terms of energy in a city that cuts electricity has almost every day . 
so we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof . 
and then we thought about those panels under the roof like gathering space with a new use bars and areas that would create this urban oasis . 
and these porches on the roof , they collect together all the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside . 
hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction . 
the second example is a master plan of two 10,000 apartments and facilities in the city of tunis . 
and for doing such a big project , the biggest ever designed i've project , i really needed to understand the city of tunis and its surroundings , but also the tradition and culture . 
during that analysis , i paid attention to the medina special is that this year -- 1,000 -- old structure that used to be closed by a wall , twelve by gates opened , almost connected by different straight lines . 
when i went to the site design , we did the first operation was to extend the existing streets , creating 12 initial blocks in size and characteristics similar to the ones we have in europe and with other with these courtyards in cities . 
on top of that , we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines , and this initial modified this pattern . 
and the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan . 
and for that i thought , what would be the best orientation in the mediterranean climate for an apartment ? 
and &apos;s north , south -- because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation . 
so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction . 
and this is the result is that almost like a combination of the european and the arab city block . 
it has courtyards with these blocks , and then on the ground floor you have all these connexions for the pedestrians . 
and also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density levels on the upper density and a lower on the ground floor . 
and it reinforces also this idea of the gates . 
the roof , which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community and the space taken by the construction . 
and all the neighbors , that &apos;s where they can go up and do activities and socialize , such as having two -- run a kilometer jumping in the morning , from one to another building . 
these two examples , they have a common approach in the design process . 
and also , they are emerging in countries where you can see the cities for literally . 
in these cities , the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow . 
for this reason , i see more evan importance to look at the architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect people and nature . 
thank you very much . 
don't onora o &apos;neill : what we understand about trust 
so i'm going to talk about trust , and i'm reminding you going to start by views of the standard that people have about trust . 
i think these are they've become commonplace , so the é clich of our society . 
and i think there are three . 
a one's claim : there has been a great , trust in decline very widely believed . 
the second is an aim : we should have more trust . 
and the third is a task : we should rebuild trust . 
i think the claim that the aim , are all misconceived and the task . 
so what i'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which i think quite a lot better give one on the purchase matter . 
the first claim : why do people think has declined trust ? 
and if i really think about it on the basis of my own don't evidence , i know it the answer . 
i'm inclined to think it may have declined activities in some or some institutions and it might have grown in others . 
i have an don't overview . 
but , of course , i can look at the opinion polls , and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that has declined trust . 
when you actually look at opinion polls across time , not much there's evidence for that . 
that's to say , the people who were principally mistrusted 20 years ago , and journalists , politicians are still mistrusted . 
and the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago : trusted rather still are highly judges , nurses . 
the rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly midway . 
but evidence is that good ? 
opinion polls record what is , of course , opinions . 
they can record what else ? 
so looking at the generic they're attitudes people report that certain when you ask them questions . 
do you trust politicians teachers ? do you trust ? 
now if somebody said to you , &quot; do you trust greengrocers ? 
do you trust fishmongers ? 
do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot; 
you would probably begin by saying , &quot; what to do ? &quot; 
and that would be a perfectly sensible response . 
and you might say , when you understood the answer to that , &quot; well , i trust some of them , but not others . &quot; 
a perfectly rational that's thing . 
in short , in our real lives , we seek to place in a way trust differentiated . 
we make an assumption that don't the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office -- or holder type of person is going to be uniform . 
i might say , for example , a certain that i certainly trust elementary school teacher i know it to teach the reception in class to read , but no way to drive the minibus school . 
i know it might , after all , a good that she wasn't driver . 
i might most loquacious trust my friend , a conversation going to keep but perhaps not -- but not to keep a secret . 
simple . 
so if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we drop all that sort of intelligence when we think more abstractly about trust ? 
i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that exists , because they actually try to obliterate that goes into the good judgment placing trust . 
secondly , what about the aim ? 
the aim is to have more trust . 
well , frankly , i think a that's aim stupid . 
&apos;s not what i would aim at . 
i would have to trust more aim in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy . 
in fact , i aim to positively try not to trust the untrustworthy . 
and i think , of those people who , for example , with the very placed their savings aptly named . mr . then madoff , who made them off with , and i think of them , and i think , well , yes , too much trust . 
more trust is not an intelligent this aim in life . 
and placed intelligently intelligently refused the proper aim is trust . 
well , that one once says one says , yeah , okay , that means that what matters is not in the first place but trust trustworthiness . 
&apos;s judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects . 
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things . 
they are honest competent ? are they ? are they reliable ? 
and if we find is that a person in the relevant matters competent , and reliable , we'll honest and have a pretty good reason to be trust them , because they'll trustworthy . 
but if , on the other hand , they're unreliable , we might not . 
i have friends who are honest and competent , but i would not trust them , because a letter to post they're forgetful . 
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but i realize that they overestimate competence their own . 
and i'm very glad to say , i think i have many don't friends who are extremely reliable but and competent dishonest . 
so , if i haven't spotted it yet . 
but what that's we're before trust looking for : trustworthiness . 
trust is the response . 
trustworthiness is what we have to judge . and , of course , that &apos;s difficult . 
across the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness . 
a lot of these systems have the converse effect . 
as they don't they're supposed to work . 
i remember i was talking with a midwife who said , &quot; well , you see , the call to do is it takes longer than the paperwork to deliver the baby . &quot; 
and use our life , all over our life , we find that institutional call that the system of accountability , that is meant to secure and trustworthiness evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite . 
it is distracting people who have to do , like midwives difficult tasks , by requiring them from doing them to tick , as we say the boxes . 
you can all examples give your own there . 
so for the aim so much . 
it &apos;s not easy , simple judgment , is reaction , attitudes , and do don't adequately here . 
thirdly , the task now . 
trust rebuilding calling the task , also , i think things gets backwards . 
it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust . 
well , we can do that for ourselves . 
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness . 
we can do it together two people trying to improve trust . 
but trust , in the end , is because distinctive &apos;s given by other people . 
you can't rebuild what other people give you . 
you have to give them the basis for giving their trust you . 
so , i think you have to be , trustworthy . 
and that , of course , is because can't fool you all of the people of all the time , usually . 
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy . 
how to do it ? 
well every day , all over the place , that &apos;s being done by ordinary people , by officials , effectively , quite by institutions . 
let me give you a simple commercial example . 
my shop where i buy the socks says i may take don't them back , and they ask any questions . 
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color , i wanted . 
super that's . i trust themselves because they have made them vulnerable to me . 
i think that in a big lesson there's . 
if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what are you saying . 
so in the end , i think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern . 
it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy . 
thanks . 
colin stokes : how movies teach manhood 
you know it , my favorite part of being a dad is , i get to watch the movies . 
i love my favorite movies sharing with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; together . 
it totally dominated for months her imagination . 
her favorite character glinda was , of course . 
it &apos;s a great her it excuse to wear a sparkly wand and carry a dress . 
but you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is . 
and now we are today , global live raising our children , in a fantasy -- kind of children's spectacular -- -- industrial complex . 
but , &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; stood alone . 
it did not start that trend . 
forty years later when the trend was really caught on , with that , interestingly , another movie featured a metal guy and a girl by a guy furry rescuing dressing up as the enemy's guards . 
what do you know it i'm talking about ? 
yeah . 
now , there's a big difference between these two movies , a couple of really big differences between &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; we watch movies and all the today . 
one is very little there's violence in &quot; the wizard of oz . &quot; 
the monkeys are rather aggressive , as the apple trees are . 
but if i think , &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; the wizard were made today would say , &quot; you are the savior dorothy , that the prophecy of oz foretold . 
use your magic slippers to defeat the computer -- generated armies of the wicked witch . &quot; 
but that's not how it happens . 
another thing that's really unique about &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and evan villainous characters are female . 
now , i started to notice when i showed this actually &quot; star wars &quot; to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different . 
at that point , i also had a son . 
he was only three at the time . 
he was not invited to the screening . he was too young for that . 
but he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted . 
so he wandered in imprinted on him , and it like a duck to its duckling mommy does , and i think he understands don't what's going on , but he is sure soaking in it . 
and i wonder what he's soaking in . 
he is picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty ? 
he is picking up on the fact that an luke joins the army to overthrow government ? 
compare this to 1939 with &quot; the wizard of oz . &quot; 
how does dorothy win her movie ? 
and everybody making friends with by being a leader . 
that's i'd rather kind of the world -- raise my kids in oz , right ? -- and not fighting dudes of the world , which is where we kind of have to be . 
why is there so much force force , f capital -- in the movies -- we have for our kids , and so little yellow brick road ? 
there is a lot of great writing about the impact that has -- the boy violent movie on girls , and you should do reading . that &apos;s very good . 
as i read on how much haven't who are picking up on this vibe . 
i know it from my own experience that did not provide the princess leia adequate context that i could have used in the adult world that is navigating co2 -- ed . 
i think there was a moment -- when i first kiss really expected to start the credits rolling that's because the end of the movie , right ? 
i finished my quest , i got the girl . 
why are you still standing there ? 
what i know it don't i'm supposed to do . 
the movies are very , very defeating focused on the villain and getting your there's reward , and not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys . 
you're &apos;s almost as though a boy , if you are a dopey animal , and if you are a girl , you should bring your warrior costume . 
there are plenty of exceptions , and i will defend the disney any princesses in front of you . 
but they do , who to send a message that they are not , the who are not really the target audience . 
they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy , but they are not necessarily who showing how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy . 
no there's models for them . 
and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories , and as for our kids -- three dimensional and delightful and hermione katniss are , as these movies are still war . 
until , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; brave . &quot; 
i recommend to all of you . it &apos;s now on demand . 
what do you remember when the critics brave said , &quot; came out ? &quot; 
i believe , &quot; aw can't pixar princess made a movie . &quot; 
let &apos;s very good . don't you stop that . 
now , almost none of these movies bechdel pass the test . 
if i know it don't you've heard of this . 
it has not yet caught on and caught fire today , but maybe we will start a movement . 
alison bechdel is a comic book artist , and back in the mid &apos; 80s , the -- she had she'd recorded this conversation with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw . 
and just there's &apos;s very simple , you should ask three questions : is there more than one in the movie character who has female lines is that ? 
so try to meet that bar . 
and these women do talk to each other at any point in the movie ? 
and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ? 
thank you . right ? 
thank you very much . 
two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff . 
it does it happen . i've seen , and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know it and love . 
in fact , this week , i went to see a very high quality -- movie , &quot; argo . &quot; 
right ? great oscar buzz , doing a box office , at the idea of what a consensus quality hollywood film is . 
it pretty much the flunks bechdel test . 
and i think it should don't , because a lot of the movie , if i know it don't you've seen it , but a lot of the embassy takes place in this movie where men and women are crisis hiding out during the hostage . 
we &apos;ve got quite a few scenes of the men having conversations , deep search angst ridden hideout -- in this moment , and the great for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , &quot; you are coming to bed , honey ? &quot; 
hollywood that's for you . 
so look at the numbers let's . 
2011 , one of the most popular movies , how do you think many of them actually have female protagonists ? 
eleven , that &apos;s not bad . 
percent &apos;s not as many as the number of women , we &apos;ve just elected to congress that's so good . 
but there is a greater than that this number is going to bring this room that's down . 
last year , the new york times published a study that the government had done . 
what it said here's . 
one out of five women in america say that they have been some time sexually assaulted in their life . 
now , i think the fault of don't that's popular entertainment . 
i think don't kids' movies have anything to do with that . 
i think that evan don't pornography or music videos are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when i hear that statistic , one of the things i think of is a lot of sexual that's assailants . 
these guys who are learning ? what are they ? 
what are they failing to learn ? 
the story that they are a male absorbing hero's job is to defeat the villain collect violence and then with the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak ? 
we are soaking up that story ? 
you know it , as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this very statistic alarming and we want to prepare them . 
i mean , i think the netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important , and mainly i'm talking to the dads here . 
i think we have got to show a new definition of our sons manhood . 
the definition of turning manhood is already upside down . 
you've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner . 
they're throwing it up in the air . 
when i asked my daughter who was her favorite character in &quot; star wars &quot; what do you know it , she said ? 
obi -- wan . 
and kenobi obi -- wan glinda . 
what do these two have in common ? 
maybe &apos;s not just the sparkly dress . 
i think these people are experts . 
i think these are the people in the movie two more than anybody else who know it , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential . 
now , they are leaders . 
i kind of like that quest for my daughter , and i kind of like that quest for my son . 
i want more quests like that . 
thank you . 
the link between mohamed ali : unemployment and terrorism 
i would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid . 
i know it don't his name , but i do know it his story . 
he lives in a small village in southern somalia . 
his mogadishu village is near . 
the small village drought drives into poverty and to the brink of starvation . 
there with nothing left for him , he leaves for the big city , in this case , mogadishu , the capital of somalia . 
when he arrives opportunities , there are no jobs , no , no way forward . 
he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of mogadishu . 
maybe a year passes , nothing . 
one day , he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast . 
he meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break . 
he's given a bit of money to buy some new clothes himself , running to send money back to his family . 
he is introduced to this young woman . 
he eventually gets married . 
he starts this new life . 
he has a purpose in life . 
one day in mogadishu , beautiful under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off . 
small town that kid was the big city with the suicide bomber dreams , and that group of people were dynamic , a terrorist organization al shabaab linked to al qaeda . 
so how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big city in the end up with him blowing himself up ? 
he was waiting . 
he was waiting for an opportunity , his future begin to waiting , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along . 
this was the first thing that pulled out of what we call him waithood . 
and his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world . 
it is the story of the urban youth who disenfranchised unemployed , sparks , sparks riots in johannesburg riots in london , who reaches out for something other than waithood . 
for young people , the promise of the city , the big opportunity dream is that the city of jobs , but , of wealth , young people are not sharing their of prosperity in the cities . 
who &apos;s often youth unemployment suffer from the highest rates . 
by 2030s happen , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. 
if we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide opportunities them , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be 2.0. the story of cities 
and in my city of birth , mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment . 
70 percent don't don't work , go to school . 
they pretty much do nothing . 
i went back to mogadishu last month , and i went to visit madina hospital , i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing in front of that hospital -- bullet ridden thinking , what if i had never left ? 
what if i had been forced into that same state of waithood ? 
i would have become a terrorist ? 
i'm not really sure about the answer . 
my being in mogadishu reason for that was actually a month to host youth summit leadership and entrepreneurship . 
i brought together about 90 young somali leaders . 
we sat down and brainstormed solutions on their biggest challenges facing to the city . 
one of the young men in the room was aden . 
he went to university in mogadishu , graduated . 
there were no , no jobs opportunities . 
i remember him because he was telling me , a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al shabaab and other organizations , to be recruited terrorist . 
they sought people like him out . 
but his route takes a different story . 
in mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point a to point b are the roads . 
twenty years of civil war -- three have completely destroyed the road , and a motorbike system can be the easiest way to get around . 
aden saw an opportunity and seized it . 
he started a motorbike company . 
he began to local residents motorbikes renting out who couldn't normally afford them . 
he bought 10 bikes , with the help of his family and friends , and eventually dream is to expand to several hundred within the next three years . 
this is how different story ? 
what makes his story different ? 
i believe it is his ability to identify seize and a new opportunity . 
and i believe , entrepreneurship &apos;s entrepreneurship can be waithood against the most powerful tool . 
it empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic so they are seeking desperately opportunities . 
and you can train young people to be entrepreneurs . 
i want to talk to you about a young man who attended meetings , one of my mohamed mohamoud , a florist . 
he was helping me some of the train young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship . 
actually the first he's florist has seen in mogadishu over 22 years , and until recently , until mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used bouquets shipped plastic from abroad . 
if someone asked you , &quot; when was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot; for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; never . &quot; 
so mohamed saw an opportunity . 
he started a company floral landscaping and design . 
he created a farm right outside of mogadishu , and started for tulips and lilies , which he said the harsh could survive mogadishu climate . 
and he began to flowers delivering weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and now working on creating he's mogadishu's use first park in 22 years . 
no use in mogadishu there's park . 
he wants to create a space , where families , young people can come together , and , as he says , smell the roses proverbial . 
and he doesn't because they grow roses too much water use , by the way . 
so the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , mohamed's presence really had a profound impact on the youth in that room . 
they had never really thought about starting up a business . 
they've thought about working for an ngo , working for the government , his story , but his innovation , really had a strong impact on them . 
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity . 
he empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers . 
by the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city . 
they came up with solutions to local entrepreneurial problems . 
so inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great , but step capital young people need their ideas to make a reality . 
they need to guide expertise and mentorship launching and developing them in their businesses . 
young people connect with the resources they need provide the support them , they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth . 
for me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business . 
&apos;s about creating a social impact . 
mohamed is not simply selling flowers . 
i believe he is selling hope . 
his peace that's park , and what he calls , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city . 
aden street hired kids to help those rent out and maintain bikes for him . 
it &apos;s he them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood . 
these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities . 
so my suggestion is youth , entrepreneurs , turn into their incubate and nurture inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and peace and bombs parks waithood than the car . 
thank you . 
chinese shaolan : learn to read , with ease . 
for up in taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories my mother was showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of chinese characters . 
ever since then , i was fascinated by this incredible language . 
but to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china . 
over the past few years , i've been wondering if i can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so . 
i started thinking about how fast , a new method of learning chinese might be useful . 
since the age of five , i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence . 
i learned the characters every day during the course of the next 15 years . 
since we only have five minutes , that we have a better &apos;s fast and simpler way . 
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters . 
you need only 1,000 to understand the basic literacy . 
the top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic enough to read literature -- road restaurant menus , signs , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers . 
today to start with eight i'm going to show you how the method works . 
are you ready ? 
your mouth open until &apos;s as wide as possible square . 
you get a mouth . 
this is a person going for a walk . 
person . 
this is a tree . 
tree . 
this is a mountain . 
the sun . 
the purple moon which . 
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west . 
i call these characters radicals eight . 
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters . 
a person . 
if someone walks behind that is , &quot; to follow . &quot; 
as the old saying goes , two , three is company is a crowd . 
if a person their arms stretched wide , this person is saying , &quot; it was this big . &quot; 
the person inside the mouth , the person is trapped . 
a prisoner , just like he's jonah inside the whale . 
one tree is a tree . two trees together , we have the woods . 
three trees together , we create the forest . 
put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation . 
put a mouth on the top of the tree , that's &quot; idiot . &quot; 
since easy to remember , is pretty idiotic talking a tree . 
remember fire ? 
two fires together , i get really hot . 
fires that's three together , a lot of flames . 
underneath the set fire burning , that &apos;s the two trees . 
for us , the sun is the source of prosperity . 
two together , prosperous suns . 
three together , that's sparkles . 
and the purple moon which put the sun shining &apos;s brightness , together . 
it also means a day after tomorrow , and a night . 
the sun is coming up above the horizon . sunrise . 
a door ; put a plank inside the door , door bolt a &apos;s . 
put a door inside the mouth , asking questions . 
is anyone . knock knock running ? 
this person is out of a door , sneaking escaping , evading . 
on the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , they have an argument . 
three women &apos;s together , be careful , adultery . 
so we have gone through almost 30 characters . 
by using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. 
the next eight of group will build an extra 32. characters 
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese -- -- eight year old . 
so after we know it , we start building the characters phrases . 
for example , the mountain and the fire together , we have a volcano . &apos;s mountain fire . 
we know it japan is the land of the rising sun . 
this is a sun placed japan , because the origin with lies to the east of china . 
so a sun , japan , we build together origin . 
a person behind japan , what do we get ? 
a japanese person . 
the character on the left is two stacked mountains on top of each other . 
that means , ancient in exile in china , because chinese emperors political enemies , they put their beyond mountains in exile . 
nowadays , getting into exile has turned out . 
which tells you where you mouth to get out is an exit . 
this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage . thank you .
