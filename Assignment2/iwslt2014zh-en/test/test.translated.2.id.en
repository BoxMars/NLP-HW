jay meg : why 30 20 is not new .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first patient needs a therapy .  (2)
and i was a university in berkeley . they read in clinical psychologist students .  (3)
she was a woman named alex 26 .  (4)
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off the shoes , and she said to me , she told me to the men .  (5)
when i heard this , i disengaged .  (6)
one of my students , the first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk about my boys .  (8)
i think i can deal with this thing .  (9)
but i can &apos;t do that .  (10)
alex in every meeting , all that funny story 点点 , so to me , and on the first time , and that &apos;s a very , very easily .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is the new , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
in order to have to work , marry later to have to have children , even after all , there &apos;s only when death .  (13)
and i was just like alex 二十几岁 except time out of nothing .  (14)
but not too long , and i started to push it 催 alex love life .  (15)
i refuse .  (16)
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the bed dumb , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she may be one of these people and the wedding .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time is in the best before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists and said , &quot; so ! &quot; moment .  (20)
in that moment , i learned that 30 二十岁 is not new .  (21)
yeah , people and 安顿 later than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between 低谷 her development .  (22)
and alex 二十几岁 to develop a good time , and we sat kill it .  (23)
and i realized that oversight &quot; kindness &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for love , alex and her life 二十几岁 around for people with the family .  (24)
now there &apos;s about the 5千万 二十几岁 .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can experience 二十几岁 stage in this case -- and adults .  (26)
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand .  (27)
i really wanted to see 一些二十几岁 here .  (28)
that &apos;s great ! you are great .  (29)
and if you work 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 , if you because of the people who lost 二十几岁 o , and i &apos;d like to see -- okay . awesome 二十几岁 people , very important .  (30)
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human lifetime that 80 percent of the most important moment occurred in 35 years old .  (32)
that means every 10 to your life is going to experience what it means &quot; ! &quot; moment that happened in eight of 30 中旬 .  (33)
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago , and you will make a much bigger impact .  (36)
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 终生 before , and got married , or partner 同居 on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain 二十几岁 adults , for a second to adapt . it &apos;s a spike in the last time , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own , and what it is time for change .  (38)
we know where life than other 二十岁 , some of the biggest change , and we also know that women have reproduction in the summit 28 years old , after 35 years old , and that &apos;s kind of hard to do .  (39)
so you tell is this 二十几岁 between ourselves and in our bodies , to the future .  (40)
so when we say children &apos;s development five years ago , we all know the language and admiration development is the critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life , you &apos;re going to have a huge impact on the future of the time .  (42)
but we heard that less is something called adults 二十岁 development , and we developed this stage is the critical period for adults .  (43)
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
what newspaper in the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
the researchers were called 二十几岁 adolescence .  (46)
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid , like , &quot; names , &quot; and &quot; adults and children . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , we have to do is actually a decades of the most important 期中 doesn &apos;t matter .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , you need a plan and not enough time .  (50)
this , right ?  (51)
so when you take a 二十几岁 head , and people said , &quot; you have to start extra 10 years of life , &quot; what happens when you think ?  (52)
nothing happens .  (53)
you take that guy urgency , and worked , but nothing happened .  (54)
and everybody says , &quot; i want to just before the 30 started my career . &quot; this is not a problem .  (55)
but then they said , &quot; i start quickly 二十岁 over , but i didn &apos;t have to .  (56)
i graduated from day one of my best 写写 . &quot;  (57)
and they start : &quot; 二十几岁 date , like a seat in games .  (58)
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but it &apos;s about 30 to stop it , you sit down to one after another .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i married my husband and i think the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently &quot; chair &quot; . &quot;  (60)
二十几岁 here where people ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
well , you might have something that sounds 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , here &apos;s a currency .  (63)
when things are going to do 三十几岁 in 30 , when you have this stage in a very short time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure .  (64)
these things don &apos;t have a lot of compatible , and just like that , to work on this stage 三十几岁 and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
in the middle of a thousand years later , is not going to buy a red open buggy .  (66)
that is not my job is to themselves .  (67)
you can see is that you want to have kids , or your kids a people .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people with what we do .  (69)
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do .  (70)
this is a story about a story called emma women .  (71)
emma 25 , because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent do at the .  (73)
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she worked 脾气 show that the more and more than my boyfriend live together .  (74)
and whether she 二十几岁 , how hard it is more difficult to her life .  (75)
and when she was meeting , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walks in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she bought a new address thin , and she took her to fill this morning , but she can only be looking for in the emergency situation , &quot; please call this &quot; -- the words of the space .  (78)
the last 歇斯底里 she looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
and i spent a lot of effort to avoid said , &quot; i &apos;ll . &quot;  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know that she &apos;s an opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , and i &apos;m not going to make a decision that emma 10 years that we do it .  (84)
so in the next weeks and months , i taught in every three emma 二十几岁 people , both men and women , to hear .  (85)
first of all , i told her forget emma identity crisis , and they started identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; they identity capital &quot; meant value up for yourself .  (87)
what do you think about this is going to be in .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma career , and nobody knows the work of their future , but i know that there could be identity , to more identity capital .  (89)
this is a professional multinational with that , in that space , and you want to step up to the time .  (90)
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people , but i was exploring 漠视 meaningless exploration , and that &apos;s not going to go to explore .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trials of work and get them to count .  (93)
secondly , i tell emma overestimate tribes , cities .  (94)
the new capital , the new can almost always about out from the inside of the people at the community .  (95)
we call the new things out of the weak to come , let &apos;s friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friend .  (96)
yes , about half the people who never 二十几岁 or not full employment .  (97)
but it &apos;s not about half the connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group .  (98)
half of the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connecting to your neighbor as you get the job that was not 张贴 to work .  (99)
this is not cheating . this is information about how to communicate science .  (100)
and finally , emma that people don &apos;t have a choice family and friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as soon 一个二十几岁 , who &apos;s emma with someone 结伴 , to create a family to take her family .  (102)
i tell emma choice family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a more than 20 , 30 , even better 25 , which is the next time , and i agreed .  (104)
in other people , but when you start to marry auditorium , and you manage your sleep or 同居 people don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
and in the best kung fu &apos;s marriage is time before married with love , which means that as rich as to work with that .  (106)
there &apos;s family choices that you want to people , and that &apos;s not just to make that choice you succeed or and the waste of time .  (107)
and how that emma ?  (108)
well , it turns out that we address thin , and she found her a roommate had a family in another work in an art museum .  (109)
the weak . she was there for a job .  (110)
give her a job that she left he 同居 reasons .  (111)
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners .  (112)
she and her a consciously chose people get married .  (113)
she loved her new job , her love of his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 behind a big enough to 的卡 . &quot; pieces .  (114)
emma story to this thing that sounds very simple , but this is my favorite 二十几岁 and the reason why people work .  (115)
it &apos;s so easy to help them .  (116)
just like 二十几岁 people out of los angeles international airport flights somewhere in the destination .  (117)
and the fly , and it &apos;s a little further in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s the difference .  (118)
likewise , or even is in 21 29岁 25 , a good , good time to rest , a good tedtalks can 对接 and a few generations , maybe even a very big impact .  (119)
and to give a worth spreading , and you know who 二十几岁 ideas .  (120)
and it &apos;s what i learned to alex as simple words .  (121)
they don &apos;t know about you , or didn &apos;t do definition .  (122)
now , you &apos;re going to your life .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
computer : 李镇河 李镇河 into : &quot; really &quot; infinite world , to your imagination .  (125)
look at the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and 隔阂 digital information , and we have with virtual reality . gap between the virtual world , in our imagination is infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , it &apos;s a gap is less than one millimeter , is the touchscreen glass and thin , so it &apos;s a computer all the people .  (127)
but i was thinking , if not virtual reality , and the boundaries between good ?  (128)
so i started to this crazy idea .  (129)
the first thing i made that tool , it can number into space , if you take a pen that force on the screen , with a pen pen , and this is going into a little pixels of virtual worlds .  (130)
designers directly in three-dimensional space to their ideas , the surgeon can practice on the screen for organs inside virtual surgery .  (131)
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of boundaries .  (132)
but we are in the hands out .  (133)
how can we reach into a digital information and interacting , we have to use my hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentors 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space move into the number of jobs .  (135)
because in the window and file a space , where they pick it becomes like a book with shelves from so easily .  (136)
and you can read this book , and in each window &apos;s floating virtual out across the board of words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands stretched or by the model .  (138)
in this case , that we &apos;re in the digital world .  (139)
but how could it be to get into digital information into our world ?  (140)
that &apos;s a lot of people in the shop and 退货 online experience .  (141)
but now than you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because i , here &apos;s an increase of 试衣间 online .  (143)
this is the system , and the geometry of our bodies , and we drive through a or a look at the way that show us all .  (144)
but , again , i started to think about this idea , how can we make the space that for a little pixels can touch it , to actually feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i had my mentor 石井裕 雷米 my partner , steve , the common material , &quot; make it a little pixels . &quot;  (147)
in this case , this is like 磁体 spherical shape we like a 3d space of a computer , which means that this object and people will move into this little three-dimensional space 一三维 any place .  (148)
so how do we eliminate gravity is , for a ball , and it &apos;s magnetically levitated . and drive the technology was on a ball together to control movement .  (149)
by the number of programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , you can movement in the world of matter that can be recorded , the permanent and back .  (150)
so it can be 编排 dance , and the real to teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 , and you can actually going to be repeated itself .  (151)
you can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets , and different physical movement , the computer screen or textbooks , this is real learning , you can touch it , feel it , is to force .  (152)
more exciting , it &apos;s not something that is to the computer into a real stuff , but programming world to imagine that we will transform even a regular physical activity .  (153)
and as you can see , digital information . that &apos;s not going to give us , but we &apos;ll start acts as a part of our physical environment , and we don &apos;t cut to the real world .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can get a border , this is what we have enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books .  (157)
in the &apos; 70s , i had two 体操 湖南 learning . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years .  (158)
when i was in elementary school , one grade , and i want to 转学 体校 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , and i want to 转学 体校 , all free .  (159)
my mother said , &quot; no , the tiger . &quot;  (160)
my parents , and i hope they as long as the engineers . i want my parents , as long as they are the engineers .  (161)
as the 文革 , they only get -- think happiness is a good way of 高薪 .  (162)
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter .  (163)
but i dream is to be 黄梅戏 actor .  (164)
imagine that i was playing the piano .  (165)
little 戏曲 to learn from actor to actor 戏曲 身段 kung fu , started to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i wanted to do everything 黄梅戏 way to go to school .  (166)
and he wrote to even 戏校 a radio host .  (167)
but there was a big idea , like that .  (168)
not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious .  (169)
they just have my 小伙伴 for me , but they also as a child , and i powerless .  (170)
when i was 15 , what &apos;s going to learn , much older .  (171)
my dream is not going to do .  (172)
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness .  (173)
injustice ! my god .  (174)
ok , i decided to find another mission for themselves .  (175)
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal .  (176)
i learned from the book .  (177)
and the 三毛 南怀瑾 全集 &quot; and &quot; the history of my experience -- to the united states in 1995 , what i first read a book ?  (178)
and of course , is the 禁书 .  (179)
the earth is about &quot; the farmers .  (180)
real to be propaganda . okay .  (181)
bible interesting , but it &apos;s odd .  (182)
他日 and talk about the topic .  (183)
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot;  (184)
my heart moving , &quot; a &quot; is not honor and more than &quot; submission . &quot;  (185)
it &apos;s become my 儒家 负罪感 up out of the tools i climb up , it becomes 儒家 负罪感 tool to rebuild my relationship with their parents .  (186)
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , you first saw this map , i think it &apos;s a strange , because this is the chinese students from big to use a map of the world .  (189)
never before i realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily have to , in the world .  (190)
this map , with a view .  (191)
don &apos;t read a novel .  (192)
it is , in academia standards .  (193)
and even became a religious 比较文学 research . that &apos;s a religion , even 比较文学 that research .  (194)
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding . contrast scholars to control for a project has a full understanding .  (195)
and i wonder , if you have to work in reading , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ?  (196)
so i started to read the book about it .  (197)
they can be about the same -- different parties , they can be about the same -- different parties , or two friends have shared experience .  (198)
what is the experience of politics and economics , mental experience is temptation , jesus , economic , political and spirit .  (199)
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : social responsibility and desire , fear -- interesting .  (200)
if you know , the book , and you want to compare the two language , which is very interesting .  (201)
so thomas 默 . &quot; and &quot; the 庄子 阿伦 watts , &quot; the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost , i was one that we can bring to it .  (202)
for example , is that i realized that the translator , &quot; happiness &quot; the chinese word for it could mean literally &quot; quick joy , &quot; well ...  (203)
&quot; bride chinese word for the literal meaning &quot; it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god !  (204)
and i had become 今人 communicate with an amazing discovery , books . i had become 今人 communicate with an amazing discovery , .  (205)
and let me alone don &apos;t feel helpless .  (206)
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , it &apos;s not what 破灭 dreams .  (207)
i started to realize that it &apos;s not the only purpose dream , i started to realize that dream is really the only purpose .  (208)
it &apos;s the most important for us to touch that dream come from the places where , passion , happiness , the place .  (209)
even a broken 灭 dreams , and you can experience the touch .  (210)
because in this book , i &apos;m so happy to live life of purpose and meaning , to be clear , in most of the time .  (211)
and you will never wish at any age .  (212)
thank you .  (213)
thank you .  (214)
thank you .  (215)
john 帕鲁尔 颂歌 塞加尔 : envy .  (216)

well , it &apos;s all a .  (224)
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other people &apos;s awfully have high score .  (225)
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all of the creative and nothing but .  (226)
i gave all of the people in a row 等分 and myself in this because i &apos;ve got to do some more radical .  (227)
i don &apos;t understand me .  (228)
i don &apos;t understand where the idea is coming out .  (229)
i don &apos;t know why they &apos;re very good .  (230)
i was feeling great .  (231)
i don &apos;t know why i never out .  (232)
i mean , this thing to do so .  (233)
i actually didn &apos;t get out !  (234)
but it &apos;s important , so why do i care about this girl , in this tiny little girl , and at the spell that ? i keep a time .  (235)
and it &apos;s time .  (236)
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere .  (237)
we know that &apos;s the pain of babies  (238)
and that primate &apos;s going to a blue 知更鸟 envy .  (239)
we know it &apos;s the united states are agents .  (240)
but i never read a study to explain , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; lonely , or it &apos;s sort of devastation .  (241)
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s possible .  (242)
well , i don &apos;t know it &apos;s not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have an ?  (243)

and this is the 巨著 追忆 年华 一百周年 water , &quot; this work is to study the envy , as well , we can also think it &apos;s common 竞争性 that i was .  (249)
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we think about the emotional . right ?  (250)
we want to a small boy is 入梦  (251)
in a piece of cake 玛德琳 薰 衣草茶 .  (252)

and how cool is compassion  (254)
in these books , virginia , the gut 伍尔夫 with a cat .  (255)
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it as 坚 顽石 .  (256)
we look at these things together , so why would go on with envy . 合拍 novel 普鲁斯 , with envy .  (257)
妒忌 desire , up to people , from a firm foundation . that &apos;s not very obvious ?  (258)
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s a sensitive nerve to me , because we just need to think about when we get jealous , what happens .  (259)
when we get jealous , we &apos;ll make a story .  (260)
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they have to make is that we &apos;d suffered .  (261)

let &apos;s body 疲 its time .  (269)
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , to get .  (270)

he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman and pain that we all emotions than for a genius , we &apos;re interested in what &apos;s more profound and lethal . &quot;  (282)
he was telling us to find cruel women ?  (283)
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s .  (284)
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ?  (285)
other emotion would let &apos;s see , our own intentions ugly being heart and what they deserve ?  (286)
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ?  (287)
freud shortly after that says that .  (288)
one day , a 心神不宁 visit freud this youth who did that he and his wife and 憔悴 ours .  (289)
freud that this guy kind of weird , because he doesn &apos;t really do focus on what his wife .  (290)

but he was looking for his wife , some of the unconscious of is utter intend .  (293)
she &apos;s laughing , or too 灿烂 . she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ?  (294)
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard .  (295)
fiction writing about this very well .  (296)
it &apos;s able to describe this novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right .  (297)
well , it &apos;s more intense , we &apos;re more often .  (298)
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something illegal or violence .  (299)
it &apos;s going to become very extreme .  (300)
i was eight years old , i think about that . but i also see on the news came up with a story .  (301)
一个52岁 michigan that women are going to register a facebook account and used to account for their malicious year sending news .  (302)
a year , for a year .  (303)
she &apos;s trying to her before he 陷害 girlfriend . now i have to admit , when i heard it right , and she admired .  (304)
because , i want to say , you face reality .  (305)
ah , just how creative in the wrong place , right ?  (306)
from this . &quot;  (307)
a novel , 海史密斯 翠西亚 .  (308)
and i love is 海史密斯 writers .  (309)
she &apos;s in the united states and brilliant 文学史 诡 a page .  (310)
tom , for example , in her , but the most famous character .  (311)
you want to start 里普利 or what have you want to be , then you , and you have you ever have locked in his basement 应答 with you the names of the ring with you spend your bank account .  (312)
this is a road .  (313)
but we do ? we cannot do 里普利 .  (314)
i don &apos;t have to change the world , even a day , i would have to do this .  (315)
and unfortunately , because we live in admire .  (316)
we live in envy .  (317)
i mean , we are social media is good citizens , there &apos;s a trend , right ?  (318)
we can give novel solutions , i don &apos;t know ?  (319)
so we &apos;re going to see 学学 novel characters in it , they have to understand and the thing is , don &apos;t know how to do .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to 贝克街 221 福尔摩斯 夏洛克 , ask the b .  (321)
when people think that he would 福尔摩斯 opponent 里亚蒂 professor -- this genius .  (322)
but i was more like an epidemic 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 头子 his face a scottish 福尔摩斯 is needed to him , but hate him .  (323)

we proud of you . &quot;  (326)
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold 福尔摩斯 .  (327)
this is the way we see 福尔摩斯 少数几次 , was moved in , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it &apos;s like to as a geometry , instead of emotions .  (329)
this one minute , standing 福尔摩斯 雷斯 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand in the same .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he was hate .  (332)
but what &apos;s so simple ?  (333)
if it &apos;s a geometry , to do with a question of how we choose your relationship with other questions ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent .  (335)
we &apos;ll chase .  (336)
but i love contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
it &apos;s going on with envy fiction  (339)
it &apos;s going to be novel domesticate to serve , please .  (340)
it &apos;s called to get everybody 雷斯 垂 : cute , it &apos;s crazy , tom 里普利 millions , still , there &apos;s 马塞尔 普鲁斯 .  (341)

ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash .  (344)
so when i was 10 , and a dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 . it &apos;s a mountain in the wild area in the new york .  (345)
that is great .  (346)
in places where the twinkling lights .  (347)
when from the shine sunlight , like leaves , of colored glass 晶莹 feet . if you don &apos;t have a way , we think we can actually get to this place is the first human .  (348)
and we went to our camp .  (349)
that &apos;s on a cliff camp , to look at the beauty of a 水晶 晶莹 lakes , and i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
in a camp behind , a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , very , very confusing .  (352)
people to camp was too lazy to yourself , even the . they don &apos;t think anybody would up for them to clean 善后 ?  (353)
and all this question bedeviled . i became a longer sound bite .  (354)
and we have to leave the ?  (355)
but you can put it in any problem . where you live in a 伊斯坦 we leave out the garbage ?  (356)
we have in rio left in paris and london ? the ?  (357)
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector , we have to leave the 000吨 11 , and the day of the 2000吨 recycled .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know who are doing this work .  (360)
in the sanitation trucks were parked on this up in a sense of responsibility for what ?  (361)
so i started the sanitation trucks were parked on a research project .  (362)
i was sitting in the car , along the lines on the office in new york , all the sanitation trucks were parked people live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
so i really got the sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now i &apos;m not sitting in , i open 垃圾车 垃圾车 .  (366)
and in my own electric 扫帚 铲 its street , in the snow .  (367)
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process .  (368)
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell .  (369)
there &apos;s a smell , but it &apos;s not that you want , bad smell , really smells pretty soon , but you will adapt .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even a few years of working side worker , their bodies have adapted to try and megatons of the week .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
with the labor 统计局 report , the sanitation trucks were parked work is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then you figure out why .  (374)
you all day in traffic , in the footprint .  (375)
out of cars , you just trying to drive more people are not careful .  (376)
in this case , the sanitation trucks were parked really bad .  (377)
and what the itself is that often poisons 毒物 垃圾车 comes out from the terrible , to hurt .  (378)
i also learned the devastation and frightening .  (379)
when you &apos;re walking down the sanitation trucks were parked car 路沿 , in a city , you will look and see the really like the power of nature itself .  (380)
it &apos;s never 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like , or a circular form .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe is the city streets workers sanitation trucks were parked on the most important labor . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t have a day , the most efficient way , sort of from the container itself , it will poison in a very real way threats to our lives .  (387)
we attacked a century after 10 years 和数 outbreak of disease , back to our health threat .  (388)
the sanitation trucks were parked 国民经济 need .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw away all the things that we have no space , something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less .  (390)
i don &apos;t use capitalism , i &apos;m here is that they do .  (391)
and the third reason -- that &apos;s what i call 经常性 , we have , the speed of activity .  (392)
i mean , in the days and today , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , and it &apos;s clean and carried it around our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and they forget about it , and then it , because we know that there is a work in teams densest put these things were sitting over there .  (395)
so today i want you to think that the sanitation trucks were parked situation , maybe . they &apos;re called to help them , to talk about how to create a sustainable city and the people .  (396)
i think their work is really matters .  (397)
and every time they really very to work on the street .  (398)
in many cities they wear sanitation trucks were parked continues to work .  (399)
you know , they have to clean the on time .  (400)
okay , we can make them in their work .  (401)
they almost became secure that work .  (402)
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the and 糟粕 . this is going to work in need of stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and pull the young , i ran downstairs son . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 doing a week .  (404)
i want to thank him do these work in that particular day , but i just cry up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name is 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends .  (409)
i want to believe that 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we , as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
and we know , the city of garbage actually only about three percent of all the trash .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so in your life every day , in your life , into the next time you see somebody on the left out , when you ask them to find a time 致意 .  (415)
a time to say thank you .  (416)

okay , open your eyes .  (438)
i &apos;m going to tell you about a year , spring in new york are going to do the unexpected .  (439)
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 .  (440)
a few years ago , as a journalist 科技类 reported this race to the thought that was about to be like &quot; super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of men and women and girls from 屈指可数 man and some people who don &apos;t notice  (442)
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that had hundreds of the list .  (443)
and trying to remember populations of strangers .  (444)
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem .  (445)
and in a very quickly , who can remember in the order of the 一整副 打乱 .  (446)
and i thought it was amazing .  (447)
there are other 禀 talent .  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training .  (450)
i asked him , &quot; what are you ed , started to realize their memory is genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; i don &apos;t do .  (452)
and my memory was .  (453)
to this each one of them will tell you just average memory .  (454)
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;ve never heard ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall 过人 amazing and smart and a little bit weird british josh ed said to me , &quot; you &apos;re an american journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
&quot; 茫然不解 ? of course , i ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio britney 一整副 打乱 remember what the sequence of .  (459)
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me !  (461)
we had to find a person , why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 out in front of me .  (463)
most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about what other hidden , and what the potential .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called e. p .  (466)
he amnesia with his memory , like the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse is amnesia themselves don &apos;t remember it was amazing .  (468)
and he &apos;s a tragedy role , but we can understand through his memory in any way to shape our personality .  (469)
this is another extreme i met this one .  (470)
his name is kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the movie &quot; rain man &quot; role .  (472)
and he took one afternoon back in salt lake city public library , i think is just fascinating to phone books .  (473)
and i went back home and i read a lot to write papers about memory 两千多年 ago in latin write papers until then , in the middle ages ancient  (474)
i learned a lot of fun .  (475)
one is to train illegal beam that memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people want it to the memory of your own mind , 不遗余力 .  (477)
these technologies for modern life possible , but we also change .  (478)
not only in the culture , and i think in cognitive .  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to remember that sometimes we have to remember how memory .  (480)
in this place on earth are very few places where you can still think they may be interested in that beam that memory of an extraordinary memory .  (481)
it &apos;s not so extraordinary to do this all over the world .  (482)
i want to do with all these people know how to do .  (483)
a few years ago london at the university of researchers asked to come up with a study memory .  (484)
they want to understand the human brain , we do to others anatomically structure in different ?  (485)
the answer is no .  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had negative .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the brain and memory . there &apos;s a really interesting questions that are different .  (489)
these are being sent to do functional mri brain scanner memory , when they &apos;re kind of digital or 人脸 or researchers found that memory up when there are the areas activated with people don &apos;t .  (490)
notice that they use it in the brain in space and memory , it would have to navigate .  (491)
why ? what can we have come from ?  (492)
较量 竞争性 memory is a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective 赛场 memory to show that to catch up with other people .  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore won three international memory up there .  (494)
he &apos;s 台前 三十六副 in order to his 打乱 card for an hour down with all that is the invention of his , he would have it .  (495)
and in this way that he was not a bad word 4140个 back down to any one of binary . only half an hour .  (496)
a cow .  (497)
in the competition of 参赛者 using a lot of different memories are different ways to use all the skills to all of our into a code psychologists call &quot; fine . &quot;  (498)
you can use this idea of a paradox of humor is perfect interpretation of simple baker / baker paradox is that i have two people to remember the word &quot; and i tell you a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
that &apos;s a baker .  (500)
and i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; that &apos;s a baker . &quot;  (501)
after a while back to you and i remember i said , &quot; before you remember the word is ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what words ? &quot;  (503)
by the baker &apos;s 人名 that people remember that term for more than a baker being told that person .  (504)
the word of different memories .  (505)
why is it ?  (506)
because there &apos;s no particular 人名 baker .  (507)
you don &apos;t mind with complex little memory make any .  (508)
but as a baker terms , you know , normally baker &apos;s .  (509)
baker , with a white funny .  (510)
and they &apos;re holding ourselves .  (511)
they came home from work with a 扑鼻 toast .  (512)
maybe some people have baker &apos;s friends .  (513)
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to have all kinds of ways we can make it in a time can still remember .  (514)
this exact 两千五百年 memory skills in the ancient greeks have before .  (515)
and call it through .  (516)
this invention there &apos;s a process of techniques called simonides following the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he was being asked to do that , because in the performing guest in the fancy party cool is not just d. j. to beat poet , but to reduction ode to .  (518)
he stood up there with his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all the people who died .  (519)
not all of them were all dead to come down on 面目全非  (520)
nobody has said all the people who don &apos;t have to say some of you who &apos;s sitting  (521)
the body can &apos;t get to the right place 殉葬  (522)
and this whole thing reinforce the tragedy of color .  (523)
simonides as standing outside of the site of the thrust upon close your eyes , he realized in front of his mind all 宾客 are sitting there .  (524)
he was hold the hand relative to the site to bring their loved ones around .  (525)
醒悟 simonides was thrust upon us about the things that you have probably guessed , whether it &apos;s actually not much we have to remember my phone number or . every that we all have the visual or space is exquisitely sensitive memory .  (526)
i want you to recap 逐字逐句 , i just tell the story of simonides 10 years ago , a few people shouldn &apos;t have to remember .  (527)
but i bet you now , if i put in the back of you sitting in the foyer . to speak brown 骏马 on who you know what i mean .  (528)
this advice from the latin 两千多年 ago , the first .  (529)
so this phrase . what ?  (530)
if you were invited to stand on the ted stage , and you want to talk like 西塞罗 脱稿 2,000 years ago in rome in tedx talk on average 霸气 that he would go one , and you want .  (531)
you can do is stand on their front .  (532)
and then working with a complete picture of memorable like crazy to remind you to come up with the first thing is , it was creepy a ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry . ed , sitting on the back .  (534)
this will remind you like to introduce your friends ed cook .  (535)
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney of you would like to tell the story about britney  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to you about is the fourth spent a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 association can track  (537)
this is going home talk reciting rome 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just the 添麻烦 reciting to remember , it &apos;s just one by one .  (538)
and that phrase , &quot; which is from &quot; the word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is to talk about people 古时候 rhetorical , or in the space .  (540)
the phrase &quot; means &quot; the palace 第一层 your memory .  (541)
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that a lot of interest .  (542)
and then i went to more memory .  (543)
i started a more detailed 萌发 that it &apos;s about the memory .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory process is very boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there .  (547)
the most exciting moment , and it &apos;s not a small source 揉 揉 .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing !  (549)
i know that the human brain must be 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see as 外人  (550)
i realized that if i really think about that you have to have that experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes to do something .  (552)
put it back .  (553)
i get back to back in the old 年鉴 跳蚤市场 in people .  (554)
i was surprised to find it very 带劲  (555)
don &apos;t want to try to surprise  (556)
it &apos;s not a goal is to train memory .  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working with that build your character is completely 胡乱 unforgettable images .  (558)
and it became my .  (559)
this is my competition memory , with a standard training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a whole 镜面 护目镜 耳塞 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the largest attention that is the enemy .  (561)
and i went back to the story about a year ago 竞 赛场 .  (562)
i want to drive a signed up for that as an experiment in the news .  (563)
when i thought to be in the 前言 调侃 it yourself .  (564)
the question is , experiment with the unexpected consequences .  (565)
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
back to me now talk or shopping 稿 phone number one is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important .  (567)
these are little usual tricks  (568)
the usual tricks memory works is because the human brain 依仗 them some basic principles .  (569)
don &apos;t use it to build the memory card 几副 palace , or that you can also totally in order to understand how the brain and get some benefits .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think that other people &apos;s gift 禀 that is not .  (571)
it can acquire the memory .  (572)
from the fundamental 专心致志 can keep talking about .  (573)
it was engaged to remember  (574)
or the palace memory skills are just 捷径 memory .  (575)
it can &apos;t be 捷径 on them .  (576)
this work is because forces you to think about it .  (577)
it forces you to go deeper , you want to be on most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to this training .  (578)
it doesn &apos;t exist 捷径  (579)
this is what we have to remember things .  (580)
let me find my experience in our bodies 潜藏 with an amazing memory .  (581)
but if you want to live memorable often do is to remember that memory .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
lee : -- who 沃斯 duke willpower the key to success ?  (584)
on my 27th , when i left a very challenging -- to professional management company , turn it into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i went to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math .  (586)
the teachers and other students , i &apos;m going to do a little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
and when they open up their 试卷 , and then i calculate their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst the only difference between the students .  (590)
in some of the great 课业 that students don &apos;t have a very high iq points .  (591)
some very smart , in the children are not so 课业 尽如人意 .  (592)
this got me thinking .  (593)
of course , students in seven grade need to learn something , it &apos;s like , a small percentage , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation .  (594)
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , and they would spend time and effort .  (595)
after a few years later , i have a classroom that in education , we need to learn from the perspective of psychology and students , to have a behavior and learn more profound understanding .  (596)
in education systems , we know it , which is the best students , but if iq in schools and the good life do you rely on more efficient not easy to learn ?  (597)
all i left school on stage , back to doing a master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids , and the people in the very challenging circumstances , and i study , where the question is , who &apos;s success , why do they do it ?  (599)
and i went to my research group 西点 point , ok .  (600)
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to live the training , which will be eliminated zone out .  (601)
before we go to see the word competition , and also try to predict what kids can level-up at the end of the game .  (602)
we look at work in hostile environment , just for the good teachers , the teachers would ask them to continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can improve quickly school students .  (603)
and we asked them to cooperate , 私企 for what they can stay in .  (604)
what can the more money ?  (605)
in all the different context , a character that out , no one in which the promise of the big success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
no , it &apos;s pretty robust . it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is passion for long , and on .  (610)
tenacity is a sustainable 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is on the next to you , every day is not just for a week or a month , but for a few decades trying to make their dream and reality .  (612)
tenacity is to life as a marathon and it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in the public school , i started studying willpower .  (614)
i &apos;m about to 初中生 千名 on the survey and willpower , waiting for more than a year , to look at the end to graduate students .  (615)
all the point is not just in 西点 or the competition to build the words that willpower . this is also in school , especially in the dropout 徘徊 for the kids .  (616)
for myself , for about willpower me the most incredible things is heading for willpower , we develop willpower , cognitive science , in the understanding that was how poor .  (617)
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do to teach kids to really work ethic ?  (619)
and how do they get a is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know , talented doesn &apos;t make you gritty heart .  (622)
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , in terms of data , we usually willpower has nothing to do with other factors , even with the brilliance run counter to scale .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard about the kids to be resilient in the best way to grow , called &quot; mindset . &quot;  (625)
so the stanford 卡洛杜 with a point , he &apos;s learning that people can be , as it changed the way to you .  (626)
professor 杜威克 that , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain and its facing challenges , what happens is , they grow and more and keep going to fail , because they don &apos;t believe it would have failed .  (627)
so , we grow up to develop willpower 大有裨益 mindset .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
and so i decided i close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
this is working with the eyes .  (631)
we need to get the best ideas , and the strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice .  (632)
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , to benefit from the experience from these fail again and again .  (633)
in other words , we just have to become more willpower to our children to become more willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
and the : 泽维尔 dimensions , into the building .  (636)
as an architect , i was in architecture and design , it will take the environment , and around and around the building , and the environment , which is the relationship between tradition .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea .  (638)
these two examples are emerging in a country , in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
in this case , two , one of the solution is design process , and it from multiple different from the perspective of architecture and design solutions , make the key components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall .  (641)
this is my team and i was the same for example , we were asked to design it looks like .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is , i don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
in this kind of look at the same architecture of the city -- and there &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we found that the most important three questions .  (644)
first , the building is basically empty , because they are a lot in store , people are not that big brands .  (645)
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to on the outside , because architecture is of course , the design to heat trapped in a building inside , so that we need a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in the city , because this is a city climate 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature 25度 左右. stable .  (647)
the third problem is that the building a relationship with africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t .  (648)
so for a cultural 底蕴 city , rich people , and it was called down .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , when i was so fascinated with the local 集贸市场 . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the built environment , in the hands of from 小商贩 to buy products .  (650)
this is the same idea to me , is the outdoor public setting the idea of creating activities .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 this idea of building ?  (653)
the second challenge is , when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the picture , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building on the before and after two years ago in parallel , streets don &apos;t have a little can 几百米 connected .  (655)
so we need to do is we use all of the building that will be a portal , even the two together .  (656)
and we have a gradient of 庭 design , create an open the space , and this design by its shape to avoid the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 .  (657)
around these empty space , we sort out the little store , based on a small market town and the idea of the store . and that is used as a different shape , and not the same .  (658)
i think the question is , how the building is the wall ?  (659)
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the environment .  (660)
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we from ethiopia beautiful women on the pattern of traditional dress got inspiration .  (662)
some of these patterns in the geometry of the texture . i &apos;m like , of course the problems of the wall .  (663)
we were using the walls are these little 预制 material , these windows to let the light and control in our way into the building .  (664)
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use light source , inside the building up at night .  (665)
these ideas , but we don &apos;t start building , and they moved to sort of , &quot; this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all know this , to design solutions than traditional mall solution to make more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop .  (667)
and the design of the wall , down a lot of cost , because this is not just material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of air conditioning to control it .  (668)
and we ended up saving part of the budget .  (669)
the first stage , which is to think about how to make sure that the building in power , because we live in cities -- almost every day . the 闸 .  (670)
so we were on the roof of the solar panels .  (671)
and then we can think , on the roof , in the solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , to be here in cities , for people 小憩 oasis .  (672)
on the roof of the 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to clean the building .  (673)
we &apos;ve built in to the next year , we &apos;re 第五层 as well .  (674)
the second example is to design a city tunisia 2000套 than collateral infrastructure and an apartment building .  (675)
to scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i was really need to understand not only the tunisian city , and she also need to understand these kinds of tradition and culture .  (676)
and in the process of my attention to be a arabs 聚居区 , this is a structure , over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure , there are 12 相互之间 , by the way it is connected to a straight line .  (677)
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets , there will be a little basic 12 out there in size , and we sort of all the characteristics in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning .  (678)
in the neighborhood , on the basis of any planning mentioned idea , we have a critical point , the key to connect with a straight line , to change a model .  (679)
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , these kind of a cubicle , this is a fundamental part of the planning .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is the best them ?  (681)
the answer is , you can use to 南北朝 南北 differences on either side of the house , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we do this pattern , and all of them have perfect apartment .  (683)
this is the effect , as we design a city with work together , the combination of european style house .  (684)
there &apos;s a garden with buildings , walk on the ground and around the whole sidewalks to connect .  (685)
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the management agency , 上层建筑 population density of the population density , not very expensive .  (686)
and she &apos;s all out for us to connect between 通性 portal .  (687)
this is the roof of the project of my 得意 , it &apos;s like these buildings are going to be up to the space , and to the community .  (688)
the community can climb up to the roof , my god , or poke somebody talk to make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , jump back and forth between or in architecture .  (689)
in this case , there are two in the design process with the same way .  (690)
again , they are in the city , you can see the little 拔地而起 building material .  (691)
in the city , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the local communities and for the economic impact , to build a building as fast rate .  (692)
for this reason , i think about this , in terms of architecture and design , which is , how important enough for cheap and simple solution to increase , and to the local people , and the relationship between the urban environments make people , and that &apos;s good to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said that the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are repeats itself so often , in our society has become a cliche .  (697)
i think that there are three things .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . it &apos;s a widespread consensus .  (699)
the second one is : what we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is , we should rebuild 信任感 task .  (701)
i think , for people to use this task , and that &apos;s all wrong .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is to use this task , and for a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think that &apos;s really 信任感 down , but it was in some activity in some of the institution , or in other ways , and perhaps increase .  (706)
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls , polls to find out about 信任感 in decline .  (708)
but when you really look at different times polls , actually , not many evidence supporting this idea .  (709)
so , in the last 20 years ago by the people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and that &apos;s been 20 years ago , people like trust and the nurse , still get altitude of trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in the society who 居中 , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
polls records , of course , is that some people .  (714)
or you can record polls ?  (715)
but it &apos;s a general way , you ask them what they say .  (716)
you trust their politicians ? trust ?  (717)
if you asked , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
fish trust you sell ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart the ask .  (722)
when you understand what is the , you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot;  (723)
the answer is rational .  (724)
now , in our lives , our reality in different ways to trust .  (725)
we &apos;re not 信任感 level . we &apos;re going to do that certain types , the analysis . what official administration , and it will be kind of people .  (726)
for example , of course , i would say , &quot; i know i believe in an elementary school teachers to teach them how to read , but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus .  (727)
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers .  (728)
i love that i believe , may drink to a friend &apos;s friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , he &apos;s a secret .  (729)
it &apos;s that simple .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence is 信任感 from , say , well , we all do polls 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ?  (731)
i think is a very bad polls 信任感 of measuring whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to think about 信任感 poor judgment .  (732)
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ?  (733)
it is , we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think that it was funny .  (735)
i think it &apos;s not the purpose .  (736)
people say , i &apos;m going to be more trusted not to trust , and trusted not to trust .  (737)
in fact , i mean , it can &apos;t be trusted not to trust .  (738)
for example , who put their savings that looks like it to where they are all the money to roll out 麦道 夫 people , and i think that people say , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s so easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
very smart and trust , to choose not to trust that &apos;s the purpose .  (741)
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important not to trust , but reputation of ?  (742)
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy .  (743)
i think , to make decisions about the need for three .  (744)
to see if they do ? it allows you to be honest ? good ?  (745)
if we think is one allows you to , in his field allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe that they can trust , because they are .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have a good friend honest , but i believe it or not , and they sent me to help , because they &apos;re forget it .  (748)
my friend , some very confident that they can do it , but i think some of them too confident .  (749)
of course , i &apos;m glad that allows you to my friends are not good , it &apos;s not very honest .  (750)
maybe there is , i &apos;ve never found .  (751)
is this : we need trust to look at before his reputation of .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do .  (754)
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the system , is to be a professional level , or whatever it was making it easier for us to determine whether a reputation .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that .  (757)
and i remember a 助产士 my talk , and she said , &quot; you see , now the problem is that i &apos;m going to do a 接生 手续 than what it was a child . &quot;  (758)
in our public institutions , our lives in life , we found a lot of questions . ask to have these institutions in the system to protect his reputation as can be trusted by the rules are often see it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
it allows people to work on their 助产士 , for example , they put them in time to waste 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually had this experience .  (761)
a lot to talk about it .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , an attitude , not all of you here .  (763)
and thirdly , the task .  (764)
this is called a reconstruction 信任感 . it &apos;s got the .  (765)
and i give you the task to restore trust .  (766)
well , we can do for ourselves .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but what &apos;s the matter is unique , trust . it &apos;s from each other .  (770)
you can &apos;t fix people say to you .  (771)
you need to make any 家信 people trying to get you .  (772)
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people .  (773)
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful around , and you know , people are trustworthy .  (775)
how to do that ?  (776)
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it works .  (777)
i give you just a simple , for example , the marketing .  (778)
there is a store to buy that i can go back to me , they never ask any questions .  (779)
and they take 退货 退货 , i will give me , or change color is my favorite socks .  (780)
it &apos;s good . i trust they asked me , because they think they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very good to trust myself . right ? it &apos;s confidence .  (783)
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell .  (784)
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
科林 托克斯 : the movies , manhood .  (787)
as the father , and i was happy to see your film .  (788)
i like to share it with my kids in the movie , when my daughter , four , and together we saw the track 仙 绿野 . &quot;  (789)
and then a few months , she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 .  (791)
and it &apos;s like getting yourself as 仙女 魔杖 was holding .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 , and then you see this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , raise kids , it &apos;s a fantastic children into the complexity of the world .  (794)
but the track 仙 绿野 独树一帜 . &quot;  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
this is the trend in 40 years later today , that &apos;s another interesting movie , it has an iron 大个儿 and a guy 毛绒绒 enemy to mimic the safeguard to save a girl .  (797)
you know , that &apos;s what movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different 绿野 仙 to the track , &quot; we see all the film in recent years 两三 . there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first of all , &quot; no &quot; 绿野 仙 spaces in violence .  (801)
it &apos;s the kind of violence and , for instance , like this .  (802)
but i think if we are tracking 仙 绿野 film , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz predictions of people .  (803)
use your magic slippers 巫婆 to beat the military . &quot;  (804)
but that &apos;s not like that .  (805)
the unique 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; sex and the image of the most heroic , even bad guy , who are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , together with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized that time , this is a slightly different .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
it was three .  (809)
he was too small , so we don &apos;t see his name .  (810)
but as a second child , his family to watch it &apos;s sort of a lot .  (811)
and he went in , and it &apos;s a mystery in the duck as small as a duck mother was born , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , obviously , but he was there .  (812)
and i &apos;m curious why like this film .  (813)
it &apos;s a film about courage and willpower and faithful ?  (814)
also , or 卢克 joins the army remove the government ?  (815)
&quot; 一下1939年 versus 绿野 仙 spaces . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is to win ?  (817)
and she told everybody to be a good friend into their leaders .  (818)
and i hope to our children in this environment -- oz up , and the world -- not to beat up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality .  (819)
why do we give children have so many movies , violence , little yellow brick way ?  (820)
about men &apos;s violence , the impact of women in movies a lot of this analysis , you should look at articles written . good .  (821)
a lot to affect boy , i read the article , not so much .  (822)
and my own experience , for the environment are 从莱娅 experience , i actually got to be in real life into adults to children &apos;s &quot; the adult world 混居 of men and women . &quot;  (823)
i think the screen should happen in the beginning of the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i won , mission accomplished 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be standing here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
this film to focus on that beat the bad guys , that no matter how much time with other and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re boys , you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be in 战袍 .  (829)
of course , there &apos;s an example , in front of you and i &apos;m going to defend the princess disney .  (830)
but these movies for boys . they didn &apos;t expect that the audience .  (831)
a lot of these films , all because it &apos;s a church . how girls 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society .  (832)
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 .  (833)
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , like this and kevin 赫敏 特里斯 mental image of the characters , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i recommend to all of you are now in the movie . project .  (836)
you remember the brave legends criticism , &quot; just project ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 and to do the movies . &quot;  (838)
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , the movie all by 贝克德 test , &quot; no . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
this test for not today , but you know , maybe we can do them .  (842)
alison 贝克 德尔 , is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , and she was recorded that with a friend in and they saw the movie about it .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : this is a film that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)
think about the standard .  (845)
if , female characters in movies are talking about ?  (846)
if you talk , they have in common 心上人 to talk about it ?  (847)
okay ? thank you .  (848)
thank you very much .  (849)
two women , to have to speak , there .  (850)
it &apos;s like this . i saw the movie , but we &apos;ve seen in love with the movie is very rare .  (851)
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a movie 阿尔戈 good quality . &quot;  (852)
oscar for the movie , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality .  (853)
but bell doerr test f .  (854)
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film , the story of what &apos;s happening in the event has been hijacked 人质 使馆 in big , men and women are hidden inside .  (855)
we see , for men to be in that scene in a conversation with the anxious . and one of the movie actor , the nice story is the door and said , &quot; sleep is , honey ? &quot;  (856)
this is hollywood .  (857)
look at statistics .  (858)
2011 in front of the most popular 100部 movies , how many film a heroine ?  (859)
11部 . not too bad .  (860)
but just pick a percentage of parliament women parliamentarians in terms of scale , it &apos;s good .  (861)
and that &apos;s the higher than that , and that &apos;s going to shocked in this room .  (862)
last year , new york times published a paper done by government .  (863)
here &apos;s content .  (864)
the united states every five women in a 性骚扰 ever met .  (865)
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s in entertainment , had wrong .  (866)
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s due to a child .  (867)
i even think porn music and movie with it , but certainly not where to go wrong . when i hear the statistics , i was thinking about the number of 性骚扰 , is it so much .  (868)

the people that look like this .  (934)
his story , but it &apos;s another version .  (935)
there &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and most of the is .  (936)
23 years of civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and this is actually a really easy-to-use tools .  (937)

he &apos;s the story of how different ?  (942)
what makes the difference ?  (943)
and i believe , is going to find opportunities and opportunity .  (944)
this is entrepreneurship and i believe 成年期 entrepreneurship is waiting for the most powerful .  (945)
and he drove all crazy in young people become economic opportunity for makers .  (946)
you can put people into training .  (947)
i want to tell you about a man who had to , i have a meeting his name is a mohamed mohamoud 名花 business .  (948)
he was trained in business to help me on the summit of how they train people how to create entrepreneurial innovation .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; you see the flowers , what ? &quot; for a lot of people who was born in civil war , they will answer is , &quot; never seen before . &quot;  (950)
so mohamed from that opportunity .  (951)
he started a 园林 greening and companies and design .  (952)
he &apos;s 加迪休 go out on a piece of agriculture , and he started to grow tulip 百合花 and he said that it &apos;s a bad 加迪休 to climate .  (953)
and he started to build up on a wedding in 家庭式 garden in business , and now he &apos;s busy . it &apos;s built the first citizens 加迪休 22年 park .  (954)
now , there &apos;s no 加迪休 &apos;s citizens in the park .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for family , young people together to here , as he said , to inspire and feel 花香 rose .  (956)
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire people in the room , and mohamed for young people here at the very deep .  (958)
they don &apos;t want to business .  (959)
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he innovation to those people very big .  (960)
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city .  (961)
he makes them that they can be entrepreneurs can be changing the world .  (962)
and the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now .  (963)
they came up with a business solution to local problems .  (964)
so that people are creating culture is big step across , but people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need guidance and expertise and take them up on their business .  (966)
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them to create change from the idea is that you create a catalyst for the city .  (967)
for me , is not on a business .  (968)
it also create social impact .  (969)
it &apos;s not just in sold doctor-heroes  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took the building , and it will really change the meaning of the city of people .  (972)
side street aden hire him for a cab and maintain that actually help .  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to was for was to get 成年期 .  (974)
these young . they have to have a profound impact on the city .  (975)
so i was working with more people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more for peace and park there is not the story of the car bomb 成年期 and wait .  (976)
