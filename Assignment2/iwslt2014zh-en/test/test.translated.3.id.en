meg jay : why is not new was 20 , 30 .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , and i saw my first to the mental therapy .  (2)
and i was a university in berkeley read the ph clinical psychologist . 3d students .  (3)
she &apos;s a woman called alex 26 .  (4)
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and a slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the directly to my office , sit in on the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she is to tell me about the men .  (5)
when i heard this , i disengaged .  (6)
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so i have 一个二十几岁 . i want to talk about boys .  (8)
i think i can deal with this thing .  (9)
but i can &apos;t do .  (10)
alex in every meeting , will bring funny story , so to me 点点 head on it , and out of the time is a very relaxing things .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is a new the &quot; , and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
later to have to work , marry later to have children &apos;s , after all , even after death is to have .  (13)
like alex and i like the people 二十几岁 except for nothing outside .  (14)
but not too long , i have to that i started to 催 alex love life .  (15)
i refuse to .  (16)
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same bed dumb , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next one of these people getting married .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it so ! &quot; moment .  (20)
in that moment , i learned that 30 is not new 二十岁 .  (21)
yeah , more people than ever before night 安顿 down , but it doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between her development 低谷 .  (22)
this makes alex 二十几岁 development of a good time , and we sat there kill it .  (23)
and i realized that this &quot; kindness oversight &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s serious consequences , not just for alex and her life and love for all over the 二十几岁 people with the family .  (24)
now there &apos;s about the 5千万 二十几岁 .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about nobody can &apos;t experience in 二十几岁 this stage . and then the adults .  (26)
if you &apos;re 二十几岁 , hand for that .  (27)
i really want to see here , the 一些二十几岁 people .  (28)
that &apos;s great ! you are great .  (29)
if you work and 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people lost o and , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 . very important .  (30)
this is not my point . it &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human life 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old .  (32)
this means that every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with , &quot; it so ! &quot; moment is happening in eight 中旬 in 30 .  (33)
more than 40 years , the people who don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money you will make a very big impact .  (36)
we know more than half the people before the 30 and mate 终生 married , 同居 , or on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain 二十几岁 for adults , to get to the second issue is in the last time , a peak , and that means whatever you want to change your own , now what is change its time .  (38)
we know life 二十岁 than other stage when one of the big change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , to the summit to 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do .  (39)
so your 二十几岁 between tell yourself that this is your body and the choice is the future of the time .  (40)
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago , is the language of development and admiration critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life will for the future , you have a big impact of the time .  (42)
but we hear a few is a thing called adults , and we 二十岁 development of the stage is the adult development period .  (43)
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
researchers to extend 二十几岁 called adolescence .  (46)
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid , &quot; the names , like , &quot; and &quot; adult child . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , we get is actually the most important adult 期中 known as the decades doesn &apos;t matter .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , we need a plan and not enough time .  (50)
this , right ?  (51)
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; you think , what happens ?  (52)
doesn &apos;t happen .  (53)
you take that guy , and worked already , but nothing happening .  (54)
or , &quot; you are said to me before in just 30 started my career , no problem . &quot; this is a .  (55)
but then they start talking about , &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i can show it .  (56)
i graduated that the best 写写 my résumé . &quot;  (57)
and then they start : &quot; 二十几岁 , date as a seat in games .  (58)
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but to about 30 music will stop off a , you pick a started to sit down .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because i was in 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &quot; chair &quot; . &quot;  (60)
and the 二十几岁 people out there ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
well , it might just sounds a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , in this very high currency .  (63)
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 and when you do , in 30 of the stage is in very short time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few children stress .  (64)
there &apos;s a lot of these things are not compatible , and as research that 三十几岁 started , in the stage and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
and in the middle of a crisis that could not buy a red open buggy .  (66)
that is not my job is that they want .  (67)
is that you can &apos;t find life you want to kids , or can &apos;t give their kids a people .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people , and we do that .  (69)
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do .  (70)
this is a about a woman called emma story .  (71)
25 , emma , to my office , because she with her to tell you , is experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on do at .  (73)
because cheap , she and her 脾气 worked that show more frequently than the live together my boyfriend .  (74)
and whether her 二十几岁 how hard life , she was more difficult .  (75)
she &apos;s in a meeting , crying , but would say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she just bought a new address thin , and she took her to fill a morning people , but she can only be looking for the &quot; in an emergency situation -- &quot; please call this a word of the space .  (78)
and the last 歇斯底里 looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who would take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
and , i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i &quot; .  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot of , so i don &apos;t let emma that has decided to do is we take that 10 years .  (84)
so in the next couple of weeks and months , i told the emma three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women , to hear things .  (85)
first of all , i tell emma forget her identity crisis and started to accumulate identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value .  (87)
do you want a for what &apos;s going to be investment .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma professional future , and nobody knows the future of our work , but i know that these : identity capital would get to more identity capital .  (89)
this is to be a career that multinational , in that space , and you want to try to move that up , .  (90)
i &apos;m not in 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i &apos;m 漠视 meaningless explore , and the press it to tell you can &apos;t called exploration .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trial , and they all sorts of work to count .  (93)
secondly , i tell emma tribes , cities overestimate .  (94)
the new capital , the new can about people out of almost always from the inside of the community at .  (95)
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends .  (96)
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people not jobs , or not full employment .  (97)
but half is not that connection is weak , and put yourself in a group that way .  (98)
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connect to your neighbor &apos;s boss is that you get a 张贴 work was not the way .  (99)
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about how to pass information science .  (100)
and finally , emma that people don &apos;t have a family , but can choose friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people &apos;s emma , soon to pass and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family .  (102)
i tell emma to the family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a 30 than 20 years is 25 , even better off of the time , and i agreed .  (104)
but when you start getting married in other people into the auditorium , and you manage your 同居 or sleep people who don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which means love to do with that kind of work that way .  (106)
choice is a family that you want to people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and to the people you waste your time .  (107)
and how that emma ?  (108)
well , we address it turns out that thin , and she found her a old roommate in a family of another state a work of art museum .  (109)
the faint . she was there to find a job .  (110)
and that job give her a left her 同居 he reasons .  (111)
now , the last five years , she &apos;s the activity of specific planners .  (112)
she and her to a conscious choices of people get married .  (113)
she loved her new career , she loved his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 seems to be a big fence enough . &quot; 的卡 of .  (114)
emma story for this thing that sounds very simple , but this is what i love and 二十几岁 of why people work .  (115)
it &apos;s easy to help them .  (116)
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport go somewhere in the flights .  (117)
and the fly , a little does is it in alaska is in fiji and all the difference .  (118)
likewise , or even in 21 25 is 29岁 , a good , good to a break , a good tedtalks can 对接 and a few years even generations have very big impact .  (119)
and to give a spread to every , you know the idea of 二十几岁 people .  (120)
it and i learned to say to alex . simple .  (121)
don &apos;t be you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition .  (122)
now , you &apos;re in your life decisions .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
李镇河 : 李镇河 : into the real world , &quot; &quot; play you infinite imagination .  (125)
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s the real world and the virtual world . the gap between the virtual world , our imagination is the infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in them , and is going to continue , it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , is the touchscreen glass and thin and computers , it &apos;s all the people there .  (127)
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the . okay ?  (128)
so i started to try this crazy idea .  (129)
i first made that tool , it can go digital space , if you take this with a pen . on the screen , that a pen and the pen is going into the pixels of by a virtual world .  (130)
designers directly in three-dimensional space for their ideas , the surgeon can in the face to organ in practice virtual surgery .  (131)
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of borders between .  (132)
but we still in the hands is the screen .  (133)
how can we reach into digital information and to interaction , we have to use my hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft , 应用科学 lab and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 to design the computer to the top of a small space to work in the least numbers .  (135)
because window and documents in reality , there &apos;s a space where pick it , they become like from the shelves so easy to take a book .  (136)
and you can read this book , and floating in every window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands , stretched or by the model .  (138)
in this example , that we &apos;re in the digital world .  (139)
but how can transform it to make the digital information into our world ?  (140)
that many people here have online shopping and 退货 experience .  (141)
but , now than you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because here , i have an increase in line of 试衣间 .  (143)
this is the system we analyzed the body . and geometry , through the head of driving , or a way to look at that show we look at the time .  (144)
but , i began to think about this idea further , how can we space to the visible pixels can touch it for a really get , feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , by the 雷米 , make it a &quot; as a matter of . &quot;  (147)
in this case , the spherical shape 磁体 as we in a three-dimensional space , the pixels , this is a computer and people will move the object that three-dimensional space 一三维 little any place .  (148)
we make the basic principles , the little gravity is to the work , and it &apos;s magnetically levitated mechanical drive on technology and sense of a ball together to control movement .  (149)
by the subject to the digital programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space to the limits of matter , it means that people can now , the movement in the world of matter that can be recorded , and the back forever .  (150)
so , dance 编排 can be remote and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action can over and over and over again , to actually be repeated itself .  (151)
students can put it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets , and different physical movement , the computer screen or textbooks , this learning process is real , you can touch it , it &apos;s like , to force .  (152)
more exciting , this is not to that is the computer into a real matter , it &apos;s starting to imagine programming world , and we will change everyday physical activity .  (153)
as you can see , digital information will not put things that we will start to it acts in our physical environment , we become part of the real world we not cut with connection .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can take this one , the borders left is we enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)

it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tools , it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool to rebuild , my relationship with parents .  (186)
to a new environment , as a culture , and i used to read , to a new culture and environment for you , i read .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , first saw this map , i think it some funny , because this is the chinese students from a big world map to use .  (189)
i &apos;ve never realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily have to map in the world .  (190)
it maps with a view .  (191)
you don &apos;t read fresh .  (192)
it &apos;s the standard , the academic .  (193)
比较文学 , a religion that even a field of religion . 比较文学 , even be studied field .  (194)
but let academics control for a project has a full understanding of control . but let academics for a project has a full understanding .  (195)
and i wonder , if you have to read on , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ?  (196)
so i started to read a book about to .  (197)

and the thomas 默 . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 watts , the moral approaching . &quot; &quot; people often say , we always have lost it , i was found that translation can lead to harvest .  (202)
for example , is to translate that i realized that it chinese &quot; happiness &quot; a word for &quot; means it literally is rapidly joy , &quot; well ...  (203)
chinese &quot; the bride , &quot; a word for &quot; means it literally &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god !  (204)
because i have a book and 今人 communication . an amazing , because i have a book and 今人 communication , a magic .  (205)

it &apos;s the most important for us to touch from place to dream of sources of places , passion , happiness , the place .  (209)
if a the 灭 dreams can get you through that touch .  (210)

freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard .  (295)
fiction writing about this very good .  (296)
it &apos;s very good at novel about how we see training pitch , it &apos;s not gets it right .  (297)
well , we get jealous of the more we &apos;re going to be more often .  (298)
so i think that &apos;s how we do not only to violence . or illegal .  (299)
envy causes we become very extreme .  (300)
i think the time that i was eight . but i also think about in the news see a story .  (301)
michigan women 一个52岁 discovered false register a facebook account to account and use to send a year of their malicious news .  (302)
a year . for a year .  (303)
she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before the girlfriend he now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her .  (304)
because , i want to say , you face reality .  (305)
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , right ?  (306)
this comes from fiction .  (307)
a 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel .  (308)
i really love 海史密斯 is writers .  (309)
she is the great american 文学史 very and 诡 a page .  (310)
for example , tom in , universal , she is the most famous character .  (311)
里普利 started you want to or you have , then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in a basement he 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account .  (312)
this is a .  (313)
but how do we do ? we cannot repeat 里普利 .  (314)
i can &apos;t give a huge change the world , even if i want to have a day to do this .  (315)
it &apos;s a pity , because we live in admire .  (316)
we live in envy .  (317)
i mean , we are social media good citizens in there is a trend envy , right ?  (318)
we can give novel solution ? i don &apos;t know ?  (319)
that we &apos;re going to 学学 fiction characters , they have to look at it . and when the don &apos;t know how to do is .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to the 贝克街 221 b , ask 夏洛克 福尔摩斯  (321)
when people think about 福尔摩斯 will want to his player 里亚蒂 professor -- this genius .  (322)
but i was more like a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 the face of a 头子 he really need to 福尔摩斯 his intelligence , but hate him .  (323)
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this .  (324)
he &apos;s 雷斯 垂 to help , and he hated the secret of the cases 侦破 , always and 苦闷 story  (325)
we proud of you . &quot;  (326)
and say , a in scotland , nobody would want to hold 福尔摩斯 .  (327)
this is 福尔摩斯 少数几次 we see in the way , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it &apos;s like to as a geometry , and not emotion .  (329)
this one minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand in the same .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire the he used to hate .  (332)
but is so simple ?  (333)
if it &apos;s a geometric problem to do , a about how we choose your relationship with other people of the problem ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent .  (335)
we &apos;ll try to get  (336)
but i like contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment , we come to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
it has been going on with envy fiction  (339)
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it please .  (340)
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy a million , there &apos;s 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there .  (341)
we have so good .  (342)
thank you .  (343)
ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the .  (344)
so i was 10 , and once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a in the new york in the zone .  (345)
it was really good weather .  (346)
the places where the twinkling lights .  (347)
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like the 晶莹 colored glass . if no feet , small way we think we can actually is at this piece of the first human .  (348)
we eventually got to our camp .  (349)
that &apos;s the one in a camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
in the back of the cliff camp , have a for about 40 feet of garbage heap 见方 big . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil of paper , and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing .  (352)
to camp . it &apos;s too lazy , even with all the ourselves up not ready . they think , who would have 善后 for them ?  (353)
the problem , and i was troubled . into a more sound bite .  (354)
who we leave to clean up the ?  (355)
but you can put it in any problem where you live in a 伊斯坦 . we leave out the garbage ?  (356)
in rio we leave out the garbage ? in paris and london ?  (357)
in new york , this is department , sanitation trucks were parked cleaned up to 11 , we leave 000吨 trash and every day of the 2000吨 recycled .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know who &apos;s doing this work .  (360)
in the sanitation trucks were parked on this in a responsibility for what it is ?  (361)
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project .  (362)
i sat in the car and , along the lines and new york , all at the office of people live and work sanitation trucks were parked . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
so i really got the sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now , i just sit in the 垃圾车 , i driving 垃圾车 .  (366)
i manipulate with its own electric 扫帚 street , in the snow 铲 .  (367)
that &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s the process 令人叹服 education .  (368)
everybody ask the smell .  (369)
there &apos;s a smell , but it is you don &apos;t think that bad smell . sometimes really bad . but you will soon be adapted to .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even though there are a few years working side of the body worker , they &apos;re trying to adapt to it in a week megatons of garbage .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
with the labor 统计局 report , work the sanitation trucks were parked is the most dangerous one tasks . i and you know why .  (374)
you all day long , which are of the traffic .  (375)
out of the car just trying to drive more than you , people are not careful .  (376)
for the sanitation trucks were parked , really , it &apos;s terrible .  (377)
and that &apos;s the itself is poisoning , these 毒物 often from the 垃圾车 comes out , a terrible harm .  (378)
i also learned the brutal and scary .  (379)
when you walk down the sanitation trucks were parked 路沿 , in a look at a city , and you will recognize the really like the power of nature .  (380)
it never is 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like breath , or a cycle of forms .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , sanitation trucks were parked is called the oriental . .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe that the workers is sanitation trucks were parked city streets on the most important of labor . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient every day , the way , from the container sort of , it will actually poison in a very real way to the threat of our lives .  (387)
we over a decade , century attacked 和数 disease will again , we started our health threat .  (388)
国民经济 need the sanitation trucks were parked .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw away the old things , we have no space something new . so , , economic engine would 停歇 , because people consumption down .  (390)
i don &apos;t use capitalism , i just point out here is the relationship between them .  (391)
and the third reason , which is -- i call the average , we need to , 经常性 activity speed .  (392)
i mean , today , and in the old days , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and it , and they forget about them , because we know there &apos;s a work in teams were sitting over there to clean up these things out .  (395)
so today i want to suggest you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked situation to help , maybe they &apos;re called . put them in , to talk about how to build a sustainable city , the people .  (396)
i think their work is really matters .  (397)
every time they to individual hard to work in the street .  (398)
in many cities they wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work .  (399)
you know , they have to clean up the on time .  (400)
they can make us secure in their work .  (401)
they almost into . okay . sure .  (402)
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and . this is going to work anyway -- to stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the 咆哮 sanitation trucks were parked trucks and , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing a week of his 三都 do work .  (404)
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just crying up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 first , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name is 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends .  (409)
i want to believe that 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we as part of this planet , we need to do to rebuild . we have to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
we know the city , and the garbage actually just the amount of the three percent .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so in your life every day in your life , the river , the next time you see somebody and you leave out the trash , please , to find a time they 致意 .  (415)
a time to say thank you .  (416)

now open your eyes .  (438)
i want to talk to you about a year in new york spring will have the unexpected .  (439)
it &apos;s called the memory 冠军赛  (440)
a few years ago , i 科技类 as a journalist to the competition with this thought about there to be like to &quot; super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of men and women 屈指可数 when girls to some of that old and not personal health  (442)
and in a 奋力 just look at the case that hundreds of any of the list .  (443)
some trying to remember the stranger in formation .  (444)
and in a few minutes to the back of the poetry .  (445)
and in the in who can remember the faster the 一整副 打乱 card order .  (446)
i was like , it &apos;s amazing .  (447)
these people have other talents 禀  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training .  (450)
i asked him , &quot; ed is when you start to realize their memory is genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; i don &apos;t what .  (452)
it &apos;s my memory .  (453)
to this every one of the people are going to tell you they just typically memory .  (454)
when i was , &quot; whoa , how i never heard of ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall 过人 amazing and smart and a little bit weird ed to the people i said , &quot; josh you is a u.s. journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really want to in the u.s. national radio on how to remember britney 一整副 打乱 card order .  (459)
can prove this is that everyone can do it . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney you can teach but also taught me  (461)
we had to teach a man , why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very strange way 序幕 out in front of me .  (463)
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and research on memory , i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes to remember , and the other is what is hidden .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called p. e .  (466)
he had amnesia with his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember amnesia feel really quite amazing .  (468)
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can learn in which the memory of shape our personality .  (469)
this is another extreme i met somebody like this .  (470)
he called kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in &quot; the people in the movie &quot; role .  (472)
he and i spent a public library in salt lake city afternoon back to the phone books , i think is just fascinating  (473)
and i went back home and i read a lot of writing about memory paper in 两千多年 ago in latin , they write from ancient until then , during the middle ages  (474)
and i learned a lot of really interesting .  (475)
one is used to train beam culture , this may memory of that don &apos;t like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people want to send their memory to 不遗余力 to your mind .  (477)
these technologies for modern life possible , but also we change .  (478)
not only in the culture , and i think in cognitive .  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to memory sometimes think we have to remember how memory .  (480)
in this place on earth are very few places that you still get people interested in training may grow memory beam that memory is a contest .  (481)
it &apos;s not that different around the world that are starting to do .  (482)
i deeply about this with these people want to know how to do it .  (483)
a few years ago london school of university of researchers asked to a contest to study memory .  (484)
they want to figure out the human brain with others if we in the anatomy of different structure ?  (485)
the answer is no  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the brain -- the memory . they have a really interesting is that the different .  (489)
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner , when they &apos;re memory digital or 人脸 kind , or pattern researchers found that memory . there are brain areas to activate the ordinary people don &apos;t .  (490)
notice that they are using it in the brain in space and navigation memory , will use to .  (491)
why ? what can we have to look like ?  (492)
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way a year go 白热化 will someone with more effective way 赛场 memory show and other people have to catch up  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there .  (494)
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 card he in order to an hour down to is that all of a he actually invented , but only he would .  (495)
and this with the same way . he was not a bad back down to the 4140个 any number of binary . only half an hour .  (496)
a cow .  (497)
参赛者 in in the competition with a lot of different memories all the way to be using all the skills to finally have into a concept that psychologists call code , &quot; fine . &quot;  (498)
the concept could with a paradox of humor perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox of simple that was that i have two people to remember one word to you and i said , &quot; remember , there &apos;s a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
that &apos;s a baker .  (500)
i was going to tell you , &quot; remember , there &apos;s a baker . &quot;  (501)
after a while i was back to ask , &quot; you remember before i ask you remember the word ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what word ? &quot;  (503)
that &apos;s been 人名 baker people remember it &apos;s not a word of it as being told a baker that people .  (504)
the same word of different memories .  (505)
what is , why ?  (506)
because 人名 baker no special .  (507)
you don &apos;t mind with complex a little memory any .  (508)
but baker used it as a noun we all know the baker &apos;s .  (509)
baker with funny white cap .  (510)
they hand flour and .  (511)
they came home from work with a toast 扑鼻 .  (512)
maybe some people have friends are baker  (513)
we first hear this word , immediately produce all kinds of ways that we can make in a time can still remember .  (514)
this precise memory skills 两千五百年 ago in the ancient greek , which has .  (515)
and call it through .  (516)
this process of invention . this is a poet called simonides . he &apos;s going to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he &apos;s been asked to do the performing guest because in that cool in the fancy party . it &apos;s not just d. j. to play reduction , but to please poet ode to .  (518)
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he just go out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all the people died .  (519)
not only all death all of them were to come down on 面目全非  (520)
nobody said what are some of the people who don &apos;t like to tell who sat in where  (521)
the body that can &apos;t get 殉葬 place .  (522)
and the whole thing that reinforce tragedy colors .  (523)
simonides standing outside of only as being a survivor close your eyes , had suddenly awakened to realize that in his head , he &apos;s in front of all 宾客 can sit .  (524)
he just hold them through the relative ruins their hand to take it around .  (525)
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 thing we also know about you all to actually is we have no matter how good . don &apos;t remember my phone number or every is we have the are very keen visual or space memory .  (526)
if i make you 逐字逐句 to recap i just tell the story of 10 words simonides ago should not some people will remember .  (527)
but i bet you now , if i get back in the next you sit in the foyer in will speak brown 骏马 on who you see is that i &apos;m just saying .  (528)
this advice from 两千多年 ago in latin , the first .  (529)
so this statement . what ?  (530)
if you were invited to stand in the center of the ted stage and you want to talk 脱稿 as 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the talk , and he &apos;ll so 霸气 go one , and you want to .  (531)
you have to do is to imagine stand on their front .  (532)
and then working imagine a completely amazing with like crazy to remind you come up to the first thing is , it was creepy a ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry . ed , sitting in the back .  (534)
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook .  (535)
and then you have a mind britney 小甜甜 . you &apos;ll remember to talk about britney that little story .  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association  (537)
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just reciting to be the only 添麻烦 but remember , one by one .  (538)
actually , &quot; is that phrase : &quot; from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is 古时候 people to talk about rhetorical , or in the space .  (540)
&quot; the phrase &quot; means your memory 第一层 palace .  (541)
it &apos;s too much fun i up to this very big .  (542)
and i went to more memory .  (543)
i started to more detailed 萌发 . it &apos;s that the culture of my memory .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory . it &apos;s boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sit there .  (547)
very exciting moment , and that &apos;s not that people 揉 揉 small source .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had written a bit !  (549)
i know that these people in your mind must be 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see as 外人  (550)
i realized that if i really think about that you have to have that experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit down in the morning , look at new york times spend 十五 20 minutes ago to try something .  (552)
put it back .  (553)
back in 跳蚤市场 buy me back to the people in the old 年鉴 .  (554)
i was surprised to find it very 带劲  (555)
you don &apos;t go there surprise  (556)
interesting goal is that it &apos;s not going to train memory .  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working to create the myth is completely funny 胡乱 your memorable .  (558)
and it became my fun .  (559)
this is my competition , with a standard memory training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a 耳塞 护目镜 镜面 all a hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the largest attention that is the enemy .  (561)
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story that 竞 赛场 .  (562)
i also want to drive a signed up to it as an experiment in the news story .  (563)
i thought to be , in the 前言 调侃 about ourselves .  (564)
the question is this really got it .  (565)
i won the competition . it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake is a very good . but these are not important .  (567)
these are little usual tricks  (568)
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles .  (569)
don &apos;t use it to build memory palace or remember 几副 sequence of the cards and you can see it from the work of some work to do .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think that other people &apos;s gift 禀 it is not .  (571)
powerful memory is can acquire a .  (572)
from the most fundamental with 专心致志 can remember  (573)
and it can remember it .  (574)
memory through the memory and skills are just 捷径 .  (575)
and they really can &apos;t be 捷径  (576)
this work is because it forces you to think about  (577)
it forces you to go deeper to want to make you more focus most people don &apos;t normally get to the training painless  (578)
it doesn &apos;t 捷径 .  (579)
this is what we have to remember things .  (580)
and i have that experience in our body 潜藏 with incredible memory .  (581)
but if you want to live memorable to do is that a lot of people remember .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
who lee duke pull 沃斯 : success ? willpower .  (584)
on my 27th , and i left a very challenging career -- business management , and to turn into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i came to new york public school some teaching seven grade math .  (586)
and the other teachers , i &apos;ll give students do little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
when these 试卷 and homework up , and then i calculate their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst the only difference between the students .  (590)
some in the very best 课业 that students don &apos;t have a very high iq points .  (591)
some very smart kids in the 课业 , are not so 尽如人意 .  (592)
this got me thinking .  (593)
of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like , a little rates , parallel computation 四边形 area .  (594)
but the idea is that it can be have , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbooks content , as long as they would spend time and energy .  (595)
and after a few years teaching , i came to a conclusion in education , we need to learn is from the perspective of psychology , and the way to student learning behavior and have a more profound understand .  (596)
in education systems , we know it &apos;s the best students standard iq , but if in school and the good life do not have access to it on your efficient the ability to learn ?  (597)
all i left the stage , back to school studying psychology to master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids , and the people in the very challenging circumstances , and in studies , where in my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they success ?  (599)
i and my research team 西点 point to do research .  (600)
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be eliminated zone out .  (601)
we see the first to build a word , and also try to predict what kids can level-up to last game .  (602)
we look at work in hostile environment , it just work in the teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the academic year after 任教 , and they of the most rapidly , who can increase the school students .  (603)
we work with 私企 , they sell to ask what people can stay in .  (604)
what can the more money ?  (605)
in all the different context , a character , no one out of the characteristics , in a big way predicted success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
not beautiful appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on .  (610)
tenacity is have sustainable 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is you for the future , every day on , not just for a week or a month , but a few years for decades trying to make their dream and reality .  (612)
tenacity is put life as a marathon and it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in the public school , i started studying willpower .  (614)
i do for the 初中生 千名 on the survey and willpower , waiting for more than a year , and to see what to graduate students .  (615)
all is not just in 西点 point , or put in the race to the words that willpower in school . this is also , especially for the dropout 徘徊 in the kids .  (616)
for myself , about willpower for me the most incredible things is heading for tenacity , we cognitive training , in the science willpower , to understand that are poor and how .  (617)
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic of ?  (619)
and what they should get long-term is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know , talent and can &apos;t make you gritty heart .  (622)
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , according to our data in willpower with other factors , usually without off , even with the brilliance run counter to scale .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard in children to be tough most effective called &quot; growth model for thinking . &quot;  (625)
stanford 卡洛杜 the , with a point , he learning is that people can be , it as you try and change the way .  (626)
that 杜威克 professor , when kids learn to read about the brain and knowledge , and it facing challenges , what was happening in and grow , and they fail more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe it would have failed .  (627)
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
i decided that i &apos;m in the end of the comments , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
this is what in front of a job .  (631)
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the most strong intuition , we &apos;re going to do their practice .  (632)
we need to measure it , and this is success and failure to right and wrong , going from the failure of experience and getting back to .  (633)
in other words , we just have to become more tenacity to let our children became more willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
泽维尔 dimensions , that the : in the local culture .  (636)
as an architect , i in architecture and design , to think about architecture around , and the environment , buildings , and with the environment around the traditional culture , which is the relationship between .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea .  (638)
this is two examples in the emerging countries , a in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
these two examples in one of the design solutions , is the shape of the process , from multiple different ways to architecture , the analysis of design solutions important components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping malls .  (641)
this is my team and i was the same for example , we were asked to design into this way .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
look at the same in this kind of the building , the city -- there &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we found the architecture of the most important three questions .  (644)
first of all , the building is basically empty , because they are some of it is a store is , people buy the big brands .  (645)
the second question , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because outside of buildings were all of this design , is going to be trapped inside heat in architecture , and we need to a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because the city &apos;s climate is 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. .  (647)
the third problem is the building looks like in a relationship or ethiopia didn &apos;t .  (648)
for a cultural 底蕴 so many cities , it &apos;s called people down .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was so fascinated with local 集贸市场 the . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the environment in architecture , from 小商贩 in all sorts of to buy products .  (650)
this is the same idea to me , is in outdoor public setting the idea of creating all kinds of activity .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the question is , how can we in such a contemporary architecture 贯彻 多层 of these ideas ?  (653)
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a fast cities in the picture , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building on the back and forth with two parallel , in the streets , nothing can connected 几百米 small .  (655)
so we need to do is we use the buildings out of all , to entry that have two way up .  (656)
and we have a gradient 庭 of design , created a open the space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 .  (657)
around these empty out , we sort of small , small market town we store based on the idea . and every floor of the store that are used all over the different shape and not the same .  (658)
i think , the question is , of the buildings out how to paint ?  (659)
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment .  (660)
i started to imagine a texture structure , with a hole in the concrete , to make a controlled by the way the world , to the light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we from ethiopia women beautiful pattern in traditional dress get inspiration .  (662)
these patterns of some of the geometry of the texture . i &apos;m like , of course the problems with the outside walls .  (663)
we were wall is the use of these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and light in the way we control into buildings .  (664)
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night .  (665)
but we started these ideas not touch , to build , they sort of , &quot; this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all know , this design solutions to than traditional shopping center of the solution to make more money , because this design solutions to sell shop , and the numbers .  (667)
and this the design of the wall , down the cost of lots and lots of , not just because this 预制 material cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of the air conditioning to control .  (668)
and eventually , we also save a part of the budget .  (669)
this is the first question is , think about how to make sure that building in power to the city , because we are almost every day -- just to 闸 electricity .  (670)
so we were on the roof , a lot of solar panels .  (671)
and we think , can &apos;t on the roof , in the solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to rest here , to be in cities , 小憩 oasis for people .  (672)
on the roof of 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the interior of clean .  (673)
we now have the 第五层 expected to , in the next year , done yet .  (674)
the second example is a city for tunisia planning over 2000套 an apartment buildings and collateral infrastructure .  (675)
do scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i need to understand not only very profound . the city , and she also need to understand that all of the tradition and culture .  (676)
in the process , and my attention is a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a with over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure structure , 12 , by the 相互之间 is almost straight to the road .  (677)
when i started in the graph paper planning , we do the first thing is to get around the streets of big areas , to cut the 12 primary little areas in size , and we all of the things we in barcelona and other common european cities block of planning .  (678)
these blocks in planning basis , had mentioned idea , we chose the , to some of these key by connecting a straight line , to change a pattern .  (679)
the last step is to think about the design of the building areas in the apartment , like a cubicle , is the design of a fundamental components .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking , for a in the mediterranean climate apartment , what is the best them ?  (681)
the answer is 南北朝 to , you can use house on either side of the differences 南北 temperature , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we do this , the model for all the apartments have perfect towards .  (683)
this is the work we design , like a city with the style , with the combination of residential style .  (684)
some of the building is out there with garden , and on the ground to around the whole together .  (685)
and she &apos;s meet the needs of management department , 上层建筑 population density of high , the population density is not .  (686)
and she &apos;s for us to make between 通性 entry even asked .  (687)
this is the roof of the project i 得意 part , it &apos;s like going to be the building the space and take back to the community .  (688)
the community can climb roof to poke somebody , and about god , or do some movement , like in the morning , in the ceiling run a 两公里 , or building and jump in between .  (689)
and they have in common in some cases , design process with the same way .  (690)
again , they are in the city , you can literally see one by one of the building 拔地而起 .  (691)
in these cities , building for the people on the future , whether it &apos;s for the local community and economic impact , to build the building is as fast .  (692)
for this reason , i think about the design , the buildings in between , which is more important , and finding simple solution to cheap enough , and to improve local people , and the relationship between the urban environment , and people can make a good close to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . a start , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said to the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in real social has become a cliche .  (697)
i think there are three things like this .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . it &apos;s a widespread consensus .  (699)
the second one is : what we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is task , we should rebuild 信任感 .  (701)
i think people to use for this task , and all that &apos;s wrong .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is to use for this task , and a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but it is in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing .  (706)
i can &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls , polls that should be in decline in 信任感 out .  (708)
but when you really to look at different times polls , actually , not many evidence supporting this idea .  (709)
so , that in 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe in the press and politicians , is still don &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and 20 years ago is highly trust , and people like the nurses , still get highly trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . by the way , in society 居中 of these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
poll recorded , of course , is that some people .  (714)
or you can record polls ?  (715)
but that &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , what they said .  (716)
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ?  (717)
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
you sell fish trust ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart the ask .  (722)
when you understand exactly what the problem is , you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot;  (723)
very rational answer .  (724)
in short , in our real lives , we in different ways to for trust .  (725)
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types , and it . the official civil servant , like , it will be kind of people .  (726)
for example , i would say , i believe that a , of course , i know elementary school teachers to teach them how to read . but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus .  (727)
and finally , i know she &apos;s not really a good driver .  (728)
i believe that maybe i love drinking friends to is a good partner . but i don &apos;t think he &apos;s a secret . it &apos;s not what keeps them to live .  (729)
that &apos;s it .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence is there from 信任感 , say , well why polls 糊涂 , we all , to think more conceptual 信任感 ?  (731)
i think poll is a very bad for 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea . because it &apos;s a good 抹杀 people poor judgment to think about 信任感 . poor judgment .  (732)
second , that &apos;s how it back to you ?  (733)
it is we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think this is pretty funny .  (735)
i think this is not the purpose .  (736)
i would say , for people to be trusted more to trust . and not to trust is not trusted people .  (737)
in fact , i said it was trying not to trust not trusted people .  (738)
for example , who put themselves to the savings that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money roll out 麦道 夫 people , and i think that &apos;s how people , said that , right , so easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
very smart choices to trust and to trust is not the only purpose .  (741)
so some people say , well , ok , this is not the most important not to trust , but of reputation ?  (742)
that means to determine whether someone in some ways to trust .  (743)
i think , to make decisions about the need to think about three .  (744)
to see if they ? it allows you to be honest reliable ? do ?  (745)
if we think is the one who allows you to , in his own area is allows you to be honest . and reliable . we have reason to believe that they , because they can trust .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not they to help , and i believe it , because they &apos;re forget .  (748)
i some very confident friends , they can do it , but i think they some too confident .  (749)
of course , i &apos;m happy , my friend &apos;s reliable , and it allows you to not is not very honest .  (750)
maybe one , i &apos;ve never found .  (751)
we need is before : trust to look at his reputation of .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do .  (754)
the last decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions in institutions , whether accountability needs to be a professional level , or to the official and making it easier for us to determine if there &apos;s a reputation .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like they have to do things like that .  (757)
and i remember i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 than 接生 a children &apos;s hard . &quot;  (758)
in our public life , our institutions in life , we find a lot of questions . the institutions of the system in accountability for these can save their reputation can trust as to follow the rules to see it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
it allows people to focus their work 助产士 , for example , they were to take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually have that experience .  (761)
about purpose to talk about lots and lots of .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy thing . this is what happens is , is very quickly , attitude , not all of you here .  (763)
and third , about the task .  (764)
the task called rebuild 信任感 . this is the and get .  (765)
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to rebuild trust .  (766)
well , we can do for ourselves .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but off the what , trust is a unique . because it &apos;s from each other .  (770)
you can &apos;t fix people say to you .  (771)
you need to do with trying to make people 家信 let you .  (772)
i mean , you have to be a trusted people .  (773)
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful on other people , to know that you are trustworthy .  (775)
how to do that ?  (776)
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work .  (777)
i give you just a simple , for example , marketing .  (778)
there &apos;s a store that i could buy me back to the back , they never ask any questions .  (779)
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me change color is my favorite socks .  (780)
it &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me think they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
if for people , you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very good to trust the evidence for myself . it &apos;s confidence .  (783)
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell .  (784)
whether people to trust is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
科林 , 托克斯 : the film manhood .  (787)
as the father , let me happy , is they like to see the film .  (788)
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , together , we see the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (789)
and then a few months , she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course is 葛琳达 .  (791)
and she put yourself in the same look like 仙女 was holding 魔杖 .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 and , you see this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , raise kids , are into a child in a fantastic complex world .  (794)
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot;  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
this trend is 40 years later today to pop . it &apos;s interesting is a film , and it has an iron 大个儿 and a guy 毛绒绒 to mimic the enemy safeguard to save a girl .  (797)
you guess what this is a movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different , &quot; 绿野 仙 to track , &quot; we see all in recent years of film 两三 ways , there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first of all , the 绿野 仙 spaces , &quot; what made no violence .  (801)
the more violence is inside of there , for instance , like this .  (802)
but i think if we today 绿野 仙 film &quot; 巫师 spaces , say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re a save oz in people .  (803)
use your magic to beat slippers bad 巫婆 military . &quot;  (804)
but , it &apos;s not like that .  (805)
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; sex and unique into image of the most heroic , intelligence , or bad people are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; together , realizing that some of that is , when there are different .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
and three .  (809)
he was too small , so we see , he didn &apos;t call .  (810)
but as a second child at home , to his care -- it &apos;s a lot .  (811)
and he also run in , and then in the mystery is like a little duck was born with the duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this film . but he was clearly one .  (812)
i &apos;m curious he like this film reasons .  (813)
is it &apos;s the theme of courage , tenacity and faithful ?  (814)
also , or 卢克 to remove the fact that the government ?  (815)
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is how to win ?  (817)
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders .  (818)
i hope to their children in this environment -- oz -- the world , and grew up not to beat up to the world -- this is the world , it &apos;s very close to reality .  (819)
why we give children in the film , there &apos;s so much less violent and the yellow brick way ?  (820)
about men &apos;s violence on film for women , a lot of what this article , you should look at the very good . writing .  (821)
the atmosphere for boys . i read the article , not that much .  (822)
and my own experience , 从莱娅 are for the environment of direct experience , i got to be in real life into adults adults to children the world is &quot; men and women of 混居 &quot; .  (823)
i think on the screen beginning to happen in the last film , your 演员表 , is there , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i do a mission , won 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be standing here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 .  (829)
and of course , the example is a lot of , and i would in front of you for the disney , they defend .  (830)
but these movies for boys , and it &apos;s not expect these films .  (831)
the film , there &apos;s a big a all because of that is how taught girls against 父权 social , but these movies , not to show you how to fight boys 父权 society .  (832)
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 .  (833)
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , like 赫敏 and why this image 特里斯 vivid role , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i tell you all recommend this film . now are project .  (836)
you remember the first time , &quot; brave , the last project ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe it 皮克斯 started the movie . &quot;  (838)
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , the movie all by almost no &quot; 贝克德 , test . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
this test for people don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do some push .  (842)
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , remember , she recorded she and a friend in and they saw the movie about it .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : this is a film that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)
think about the standard .  (845)
if , these women role in the film is talking about ?  (846)
if you talk to them , there &apos;s no common 心上人 talk about it ?  (847)
okay ? thank you .  (848)
thank you very much .  (849)
two women , to have to speak , there .  (850)
there was this film . i &apos;ve seen in , but we saw and like the movie is very rare .  (851)
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen quality of a good film &quot; 阿尔戈 . &quot;  (852)
oscar the film , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality .  (853)
but bell doerr test f .  (854)
i think it should not . because in most of the story of the movie don &apos;t know if you saw the movie , no , the most plot all happened in what has been hijacked 人质 events in big 使馆 , men and women are hidden in the inside .  (855)
we see , for scene in which men to be profound and very anxious . and the movie actor , a woman in the nice story is the door and said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot;  (856)
this is hollywood .  (857)
to look at the numbers .  (858)

muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism .  (890)
i want to tell you a story about a children &apos;s village .  (891)
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know his story .  (892)
he lived in the south , in a village .  (893)
it &apos;s from a village in 加迪休 .  (894)
this little village because dry , so it &apos;s been 食不果腹 poor people .  (895)
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the capital 加迪休 , that &apos;s the big cities .  (896)
he just to , no opportunity , no , no prospects .  (897)
and just to live in cities in the tent that &apos;s the 加迪休 .  (898)
about a year in the past , it &apos;s nothing .  (899)
one day , he had a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch .  (900)
he discovered a bunch of very dynamic people , and he got off .  (901)
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes can give their own native to send money .  (902)
and he introduced to a young girl .  (903)
and they did .  (904)
he started new life .  (905)
he had a life .  (906)
in 加迪休 &apos;s one day in the sky 碧蓝 down there was a car bombing .  (907)
this is the city of my little boy is that the bomb , and when that help dynamic people &apos;s &quot; for youth &quot; a party , and al qaeda of a terrorist organization .  (908)
this little boy just want to go through a city through the story of why he &apos;s a suicide attack for the end ?  (909)
he actually wait .  (910)
he was a chance to wait for the future on his waiting for a can move , and this is the way he road first encounter .  (911)
this is going to be like 成年期 him out of the first encounter .  (912)
and his story in the world , and over in different downtown .  (913)
this is a about power , taken from the urban youth unemployment story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out of things .  (914)
for young people , a city like 大城市 dream , which means opportunities , wealth young people work , but they didn &apos;t have to in the city .  (915)
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment .  (916)
in 2030 , five live in cities , that people have three is to 18 these people .  (917)
if we in the city of the development of the young people don &apos;t think , of course , if we don &apos;t give them with opportunities for the story , 成年期 come across this terrorism and violence and gang these 雷池 will be the future of cities .  (918)
i was born in the city , 加迪休 70 percent of the people who &apos;s unemployed in .  (919)
no , no book 70 percent .  (920)
basically do nothing  (921)
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and i met with 玛迪娜 that i was born in the hospital .  (922)
i remember i stand in that are full of play in front of the eye hospital , i really think about if i don &apos;t leave it would be ?  (923)
if i have to get in the same waiting for 成年期 ?  (924)
i &apos;m going to be a terrorists ?  (925)
and i also said no , really .  (926)
last month &apos;s the reason i back 加迪休 is to have a young leadership and entrepreneurship summit .  (927)
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership  (928)
we sat down and working together to solve the city to a big problem .  (929)
one in the room called aden young people .  (930)
he &apos;s a 加迪休 in the university and graduated .  (931)
and there &apos;s no chance .  (932)
i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , it &apos;s a young party . &quot; &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit .  (933)
for those people that like he did .  (934)
but he story , it &apos;s another version  (935)
in 加迪休 , it &apos;s from a to b to the barrier is the big .  (936)
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and this is actually in the easy-to-use tools .  (937)
aden that opportunity and grab it on .  (938)
he started a motorcycle company .  (939)
to a cab motorcycle to the people who buy motorcycle .  (940)
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆  (941)
he &apos;s the story of how different ?  (942)
what makes the difference ?  (943)
i believe , is that he and the opportunity to get the opportunity .  (944)
this is entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is waiting for the most effective with 成年期 .  (945)
he inspire the young people they &apos;ve become crazy searching for economic opportunity makers .  (946)
you can put people into training .  (947)
i want to tell you about a young people , he had to , i have a conference he called mohamed mohamoud , is a 名花 business  (948)
he was to train in my business summit part of the nurturing their creative people how to create business .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; you see what &apos;s the flowers , ? &quot; for a lot of was born in civil war , who was the answer is going to be , &quot; never seen . &quot;  (950)
so mohamed from that opportunity .  (951)
he started a 园林 greening and companies and design .  (952)
he &apos;s out in 加迪休 go on a agriculture he started to grow tulip 百合花 and he said that , and it &apos;s been to a bad 加迪休 climate  (953)
and he started to send to the wedding spend 家庭式 in the garden in business , and now he &apos;s busy . the &apos;s busy building 加迪休 22年 first citizens to the park .  (954)
now , there &apos;s no park 加迪休 is citizens .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for young people together , family can here as he said , to feel 花香 and inspire rose .  (956)
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in the room , mohamed at all the young people to the very deep .  (958)
they don &apos;t want to business .  (959)
they thought for civil society organizations work for government work , but in this case , he of innovation , for those people very big .  (960)
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city .  (961)
he makes them think they can be entrepreneurs can be changing the world .  (962)
that the day before , they came up with novel solutions to the city and some of the most tricky .  (963)
they want to make the business of solutions to local problems with .  (964)
so young companies to create culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need mentors expertise and guide development and take them on their business .  (966)
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , they need help from idea to create change you is to create change in cities .  (967)
for me , entrepreneurship is not on business  (968)
it &apos;s about creating social impact .  (969)
mohamed is not just in sells flowers  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , and will really change the meaning people to this city .  (972)
aden hired to the corner . he and his cab to maintain the motorcycle  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to was to get to escape from 成年期 .  (974)
these young entrepreneurs to the city , they all have a profound impact .  (975)
so my suggestion is that move more young people to be entrepreneurs . they inherently creative spirit that will have more and park for peace is the story , and not the car bomb 成年期 and wait .  (976)
thank you .  (977)
