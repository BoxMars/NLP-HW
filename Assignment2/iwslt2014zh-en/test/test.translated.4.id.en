meg jay : why 30 20 is not new .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need a therapy patient .  (2)
and i was a university in berkeley read clinical psychologist . they 3d students .  (3)
she &apos;s a called alex 26 women .  (4)
the first meeting , alex in a slightly 不修边幅 jeans and the 上衣 , in my office , sit directly to the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she &apos;s going to tell me about the men .  (5)
when i heard this , i disengaged .  (6)
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so i have 一个二十几岁 people , i want to talk about boys .  (8)
i think i can deal with this thing .  (9)
but i didn &apos;t do that .  (10)
alex in every meeting , all that funny story , so to me 点点 head on , and the result of the time is a very , very easy thing .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is a new the , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
in order to have to work , marry later , in order to have to have children , even after death is to have .  (13)
like , alex and like i was 二十几岁 people apart from the time , nothing .  (14)
but not too long , i have to , i started to 催 alex love life .  (15)
i said no .  (16)
and i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment .  (20)
and in that moment , i learned that 30 is not new 二十岁 .  (21)
yeah , people more than ever late 安顿 down , but it doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between her development 低谷 .  (22)
and alex 二十几岁 to develop a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there kill it .  (23)
and i realized that this &quot; kindness oversight , &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love life around 二十几岁 for people with the family .  (24)
now , the united states , there are about 5千万 二十几岁 .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can experience this stage 二十几岁 in the case of the adult period .  (26)
if you &apos;re 二十几岁 , for a hand .  (27)
i really want to see here , 一些二十几岁 .  (28)
that &apos;s great ! you are great .  (29)
if you and 二十几岁 people work , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people and lost o , i want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people , very important .  (30)
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human lifetime , 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old .  (32)
that means that every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment of eight happened in 30 中旬 .  (33)
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago , and how much money you &apos;re going to make a very big impact .  (36)
we know more than half of america before the 30 and mate 终生 married , 同居 , or on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain 二十几岁 adults , to adapt to the second issue is the last time into a peak , and that means whatever you want to change your own what , now is to change its time .  (38)
we know where life than other 二十岁 , some of the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit , 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do .  (39)
so you 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body in the future , and the choice .  (40)
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago , the brain development and admiration language , the critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life is going to the future , you have a big impact of the time .  (42)
but we &apos;ve heard a little there &apos;s a thing called adult development , and our 二十岁 this stage , which is the critical period for adults development .  (43)
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
researchers have 二十几岁 called by adolescence .  (46)
journalist for people to 二十几岁 stupid , like , &quot; the names , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , we have to do is actually the most important 期中 known as the decades doesn &apos;t matter .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , you need a plan , and not enough time .  (50)
it &apos;s not right ?  (51)
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ?  (52)
it &apos;s not going to happen .  (53)
you take the individual sense of urgency , and worked , but nothing happening .  (54)
or , &quot; you are said to me , just before the 30 started my career , it &apos;s okay . this one .  (55)
but then they start talking about , &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have to .  (56)
i graduated that the best 写写 my résumé . &quot;  (57)
and then they start talking about , &quot; when 二十几岁 date as a seat in games .  (58)
you &apos;re running around , and , in one of them , but that &apos;s about 30 music and , you get a for a start to sit down .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently &quot; chair &quot; . &quot;  (60)
and the 二十几岁 people out there ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
well , that sounds that might have a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , and currency , very high .  (63)
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure .  (64)
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and as it started out , at this stage 三十几岁 and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
in the middle of a thousand years later , is not going to buy a red open buggy .  (66)
that is my job is not that they want .  (67)
you can see is that you want to kids , or can &apos;t give their kids a people .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people , and we do that .  (69)
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do .  (70)
this is a about a name &apos;s emma women story .  (71)
25 years old , emma came to my office , because she , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at .  (73)
because cheap , she and her show that worked 脾气 more and more than my boyfriend live together .  (74)
and whether she 二十几岁 how hard it is , her life was much more difficult .  (75)
she &apos;s in a meeting , crying , but said , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she bought a new address thin , and she took a morning to fill her , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call ... &quot; and &quot; the back of the space .  (78)
and the last 歇斯底里 looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
and i spent a lot of effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot;  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make emma that has decided to do that 10 years , we fall .  (84)
so in the next weeks and months of , i told the emma three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women , to hear .  (85)
first of all , i tell emma forget her identity crisis , and start to accumulate identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value .  (87)
do you think about this , what &apos;s going to be investment .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma career , the future , and nobody knows the future of my own work , but i know that these : identity capital would get to more identity capital .  (89)
this is to be that the profession , and in the multinational , and you want to step up to the time .  (90)
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i &apos;m 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to you can &apos;t called exploration .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count .  (93)
secondly , i tell emma city tribes overestimate .  (94)
the new capital , the new can about out of the people , almost always from the inside of the circle at .  (95)
new things from what we call the weak to come in , for example , our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends .  (96)
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people not jobs , or not full employment .  (97)
but it &apos;s not a half , and that connection is weak , put yourself in the way that a group .  (98)
half of the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connecting to your neighbor boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 work way .  (99)
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about how to pass information science .  (100)
and finally , emma that people don &apos;t have a family , but can choose friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people , very quickly , is emma going through and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family .  (102)
i tell emma choice family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a 30 than 20 , 25 is even more of the next time , and i agree .  (104)
but when you &apos;re in other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your 同居 or to people who don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which means love to do with that kind of work that way .  (106)
choice family is conscious choices that you want to people , and that &apos;s not just to make things work , or to the people , and you waste your time .  (107)
and how that emma ?  (108)
well , and it turns out that address thin , and she found her an old roommate , a family in another in an art museum work .  (109)
the weak . she was there for a job .  (110)
and that job give her a left her 同居 he reasons .  (111)
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners .  (112)
she and her to a consciously . people get married .  (113)
she loved her new career , she in love with his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emerging 联系人 behind a big enough to . &quot; 的卡 of .  (114)
emma . it &apos;s something that sounds very simple , but that &apos;s what i love and 二十几岁 why people work .  (115)
it &apos;s so easy to help them .  (116)
二十几岁 people like just out of los angeles international airport , go somewhere in the flights .  (117)
and the fly , a little does is it in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s all the difference .  (118)
likewise , for 21 years old , or even 29岁 25 , a good talk , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 and a few generations , maybe even a very big impact .  (119)
and to give a spread to every , you know who 二十几岁 ideas .  (120)
it and i learned how to alex said as simple .  (121)
don &apos;t be , you don &apos;t know , or didn &apos;t do definition .  (122)
now , what you &apos;re in your life .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
李镇河 : 李镇河 , into the computer , &quot; really &quot; infinite world , to your imagination .  (125)
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s the real world and the gap between the virtual world , in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , which is a touchscreen glass and thin , and the computer , it &apos;s all the people there .  (127)
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the good ?  (128)
so i went to a bold idea .  (129)
i first made that tool , it can go digital space , if you take this with a pen that force on the screen , and lots of a pen and will go into the pixels of a virtual world .  (130)
designers that can go in a three-dimensional space to them , the surgeon can in the face of the exercise to a virtual surgery .  (131)
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of boundaries .  (132)
but we are in the hands out .  (133)
how can we reach into to do with digital information , and we have to use my hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space to work in the least numbers .  (135)
because in the window and file space is , pick exactly where they become like shelves from a book , and so easily .  (136)
and you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands stretched or by the model .  (138)
in the case that we &apos;re in the digital world .  (139)
but how do we change it , and that &apos;s the role of the digital information into our world ?  (140)
that many people here have online shopping and 退货 experience .  (141)
but now than , you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because i , here &apos;s an increase in line of 试衣间 .  (143)
this is the system , and our body geometry , and we drive through a head , or a way to look at that show us the time .  (144)
but , again , i started to think about this idea , how to make the space , we see a little pixels into actually got to touch , feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , by the 雷米 , make it a &quot; as a matter of . &quot;  (147)
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 as we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer , and people will move the object that 一三维 a three-dimensional space any place .  (148)
our basic principles , the gravity , it &apos;s for little balls . and it &apos;s magnetically levitated , the power of technology and goes into a ball together to control movement .  (149)
by the number of programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , you can move in a physical world that can be recorded , back and forever , keep .  (150)
so , dance 编排 can be remote and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action can over and over and over again , to actually be repeated itself .  (151)
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , the learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force .  (152)
more exciting is that it &apos;s not just the computer put things into a real matter , it &apos;s started to think , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity .  (153)
and as you can see , digital information will not take things for us , but that &apos;s going to start working on us to be part of our physical environment , not with the real world , we cut the ties .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we can get the border , the rest is we enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books .  (157)
in the &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned 湖南 had two 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years .  (158)
when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , all free .  (159)
i &apos;m the killer mother said , &quot; no . &quot;  (160)
my parents , and i hope they elephants as long as engineers . i want my parents , and then , as long as engineers .  (161)
as 文革 survivor , they only get -- think happiness is a good way of 高薪 work .  (162)
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter .  (163)
but i dream is to be 黄梅戏 actor .  (164)
that &apos;s my premise playing the piano .  (165)
to start from small 戏曲 actor to actor 戏曲 身段 kung fu , to start to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i want to do everything 黄梅戏 way to go to school .  (166)
and even wrote to the principal 戏校 with a radio host .  (167)
but that &apos;s a big people love that idea .  (168)
don &apos;t have a big people believe that i &apos;m serious .  (169)
they just have my 小伙伴 for me , but they also a child , and i , like the powerless .  (170)
when i was 15 , what &apos;s going to learn , much older .  (171)
my dream is no longer going to do .  (172)
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness .  (173)
injustice ! my god .  (174)
ok , i decided to to find another mission .  (175)
no one around 赐教 ? no . no .  (176)
i learned from the book .  (177)
and the 三毛 全集 &quot; and &quot; 南怀瑾 historical experience . &quot; i &apos;m in 1995 , to the united states , in the united states , what i first read a book ?  (178)
and of course , is the 禁书 .  (179)
the earth , &quot; is about the farmers .  (180)
real to be propaganda . okay .  (181)
bible very interesting , but it &apos;s very strange .  (182)
the subject 他日 and talk about .  (183)
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot;  (184)
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; that &apos;s not and more than &quot; submission . &quot;  (185)
it became , and i climbed out 儒家 负罪感 tools , it became , and i climbed out 儒家 负罪感 tool , and i rebuild the relationship with their parents .  (186)
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it , to a new culture and environment , as i used to read .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , the first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from big to use a world map .  (189)
i had never realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily have to map in the middle of the world .  (190)
this map , with a view .  (191)
reading it is not new .  (192)
it &apos;s in the academic standard approach .  (193)
比较文学 , even be a religion that research . 比较文学 , even be a religion that research .  (194)
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding . contrast to control scholars to a project has a full understanding .  (195)
and i wonder , if you have to work in reading , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ?  (196)
so i started to read the book about it .  (197)
they can be about the same story , different parties , they can be about the same story , different parties , or two a shared experience of my friends .  (198)
what is the experience of economic , political and mental temptation , what is the experience of economic , political and mental temptation .  (199)
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desire and fear and social responsibility -- interesting .  (200)
if you know , the book , and you &apos;re like two language . but it &apos;s interesting .  (201)
so thomas 默 . &quot; and &quot; the 庄子 阿伦 watts , &quot; the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost it , i was discovered that we can bring to it .  (202)
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning , but it &apos;s called &quot; rapid joy , &quot; well ...  (203)
in &quot; the bride , &quot; a word for &quot; mean literally , but it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god !  (204)
and i had become 今人 communicate with an amazing discovery , books . i had become 今人 and lack of communication , a magic .  (205)
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless .  (206)
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 what .  (207)
i started to realize that it &apos;s not the only purpose dream , i started to realize that it &apos;s not the only purpose dreams .  (208)
it is the most important is that we touch from place to dream , passion , pleasure from place to place .  (209)
if a broken 灭 dreams , and where you can experience the touch .  (210)
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , live happily , life of purpose and meaning to be clear , in most of the time .  (211)
and hope and never will you at any age .  (212)
thank you .  (213)
thank you .  (214)
thank you .  (215)

when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other people &apos;s high score to awfully .  (225)
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i make all the way people , but it &apos;s creative  (226)
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line , because i &apos;ve been in it , more to do something completely  (227)
i don &apos;t understand my behavior .  (228)
i don &apos;t understand where the idea is coming out .  (229)
i don &apos;t know why , that &apos;s wonderful .  (230)
i was feeling great .  (231)
i don &apos;t know why i had never been found  (232)

we know that &apos;s the murder are agents .  (240)
but i never read a study to explain , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s lonely and there , or the brutal .  (241)
in order to understand it , we have to look at a novel because fiction is a laboratory to study &quot; envy , &quot; what &apos;s possible .  (242)
well , i don &apos;t know this is not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;re going to have an ?  (243)

don &apos;t envy , no 普鲁斯 . now , i mean , i know that people always say , love 普鲁斯 all know what , but that &apos;s the thing he did it .  (248)
this is his 巨著 追忆 , &quot; water &quot; 年华 一百周年 this piece is about as well , it &apos;s the research that we can think of the common 竞争性 , which is that i was .  (249)
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we will think about the emotional . right ?  (250)
we want to a small boy is 入梦  (251)
in a piece of cake 玛德琳 薰 衣草茶 .  (252)
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye .  (253)

the book , in virginia 伍尔夫 seems like a cat gut .  (255)
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it 坚 as 顽石 .  (256)
let &apos;s look at these things come together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and envy and 普鲁斯 , envy .  (257)
妒忌 up to people , desire , in a true narrative firm foundation is not very obvious ?  (258)
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s a lot to push our sensitive nerve and just think about when we get jealous , what happens .  (259)
when we get jealous , we &apos;ll make a story .  (260)
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they were just to let the &apos;d suffered .  (261)
we tell ourselves as stories , and the audience know exactly where to put in the details where fatal 一刀 . right ?  (262)
let &apos;s have a novelist amateur 普鲁斯 , and it can understand .  (263)
all she did what i &apos;m happy thing to be happy , and now it &apos;s going on ? &quot;  (264)
this is what he began to create their own story , and then , 普鲁斯 close-up of that , and he said , a new lover . he &apos;s &quot; sexual 虐 密室 together in a series of tools . &quot;  (265)
now we have to admit , 斯万 and 普鲁斯 , two of the infamous envy .  (266)
you know , 普鲁斯 of my boyfriend , are you going to tell him that 分手 to escape from this country .  (267)
but you don &apos;t need so that &apos;s going to admit that it &apos;s not easy , right ?  (268)

but how do we do ? we can &apos;t do 里普利 .  (314)
i can &apos;t tell the world , even a huge change , one day , i want to be able to do this .  (315)
and unfortunately , because we live in admire .  (316)
we live in envy .  (317)
i mean , we are social media good citizens , there &apos;s a trend , right ?  (318)
to give us novel solutions , i don &apos;t know ?  (319)
so we &apos;re going to 学学 fictional characters , see they &apos;re kind of hard to do and don &apos;t know how they do .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to 贝克街 221 夏洛克 福尔摩斯 , ask the b .  (321)
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would want to his player 里亚蒂 professor -- this genius .  (322)
but i was more like a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 the face of a 头子 福尔摩斯 he really needed to him , but hate him .  (323)

this is 少数几次 福尔摩斯 we see in the way , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it &apos;s like to as a geometry , instead of emotions .  (329)
this one minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand in the same .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he had hate .  (332)
but what &apos;s so simple ?  (333)
if it &apos;s a geometric problem to do , a about how we choose your relationship with other questions ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent .  (335)
we &apos;re trying to get  (336)
but i like contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
it has been going on with envy fiction  (339)
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it now .  (340)

ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash .  (344)
so i was 10 , and once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a in the new york in the zone .  (345)
it was very good .  (346)
the forest searched twinkling lights .  (347)
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like the 晶莹 stained glass feet . if you don &apos;t have a way , we have to pretend that we &apos;re at this piece of the first human .  (348)
and we got to our camp .  (349)
it &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
and in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , very , very confusing .  (352)
people to camp was too lazy , even with all the ourselves up not ready . they think , who would have 善后 for them ?  (353)
the problem , and i was troubled . it was a longer sound bite .  (354)
who &apos;s going to clean up , we leave the ?  (355)
but you can put it in any problem you live in a 伊斯坦 . where we leave out the garbage ?  (356)
in rio we leave out the garbage ? in paris and london ?  (357)
in new york , this is sanitation trucks were parked sector , we have to leave the 000吨 11 , and the day of the 2000吨 recycled .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know who &apos;s doing this work .  (360)
in the sanitation trucks were parked on this in a sense of responsibility for what ?  (361)
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project .  (362)
i was sitting in the car , and along the track , on a new york at the office workers live and work the sanitation trucks were parked . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
and i really got the sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now , i just sit in 垃圾车 , i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 .  (366)
i myself and the electric 扫帚 thing street , in the snow 铲 .  (367)
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process .  (368)
everyone can be asked the smell .  (369)
there is smell , but it &apos;s not what you think that bad . sometimes smell really bad . but you &apos;ll soon will adapt .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even though there are a few years working side of worker , their bodies have adapted to try and a week megatons of garbage .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
with the labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked work is the most dangerous , one of the tasks , and then you figure out why .  (374)
you all day on the road , which are of traffic .  (375)
out of the car just trying to more than you , and people often not enough to be careful .  (376)
and the sanitation trucks were parked for me , it was so bad .  (377)
and what the itself is poisoning , these 毒物 often from 垃圾车 comes out , in a terrible harm .  (378)
i also learned the brutal and scary .  (379)
when you &apos;re walking down the 路沿 , in the sanitation trucks were parked car at a city , you can start to recognize the really like the power of nature itself .  (380)
it never is 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like breath , or a circular form .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important workforce . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t efficient every day , the clean up very rapidly , from the in containers , bring it to the poison in a very real way threats to our lives .  (387)
we over a decade , century 和数 attacked disease will again , we started to threaten our health .  (388)
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , we have no space of new things . that &apos;s it , the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consumption down .  (390)
i don &apos;t use capitalism , here &apos;s just that their relationship .  (391)
and the third reason -- that &apos;s what i call the average , we need to , 经常性 activity speed .  (392)
i mean , in today &apos;s in and days , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry the coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know that there &apos;s a work in teams were sitting over there and clean this thing off .  (395)
so today i want to suggest to you about the sanitation trucks were parked situation , maybe help that they &apos;re called . put them in , to talk about how to build a sustainable one , the city .  (396)
i think their work is a noble .  (397)
every time , they really very to work in the street .  (398)
in many cities , they wear sanitation trucks were parked continues to work .  (399)
you know , they would be to clean up the on time .  (400)
they allow us to secure in their work .  (401)
they almost became okay . sure .  (402)
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and junk . this is going to work in all need to keep stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks and 咆哮 , i pulled the young boy ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing a week and 三都 do work .  (404)
i want to thank him to do this job in that particular days , but i just crying up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , and again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name is 保利 , we had a working together , you become friends .  (409)
i want to believe that 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we , as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
the city , that we know that it &apos;s the only three percent of all the garbage .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so , in your life every day , in your life , into the next time you see somebody and you leave out the , you find a time 致意 to them .  (415)
find a time to say thank you .  (416)

the threshold into 门厅 in the hallway and other parts of the soft comfort .  (427)
the light on the sweet pastry monster .  (428)
he was sitting in this horse brown on the 骏马 马背 is 招手 to you .  (429)

around and around and he walked into the living room  (433)
standing in the room to your imagination to imagine appeared on the largest 小甜甜 britney  (434)
she &apos;s exposed to wear you coffee table , dancing and singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot;  (435)
and with i walked in your kitchen .  (436)
the kitchen ground covered by a 黄砖路 依次 out , you get to the oven , you go to the track , &quot; &quot; 绿野 仙 in dorothy 铁皮 people 稻草人 and lions their hands on 蹦蹦跳跳 walking arm in arm , to come to you .  (437)
okay , open your eyes .  (438)
i &apos;m going to talk to you about a year , spring in new york are going to have the unexpected .  (439)
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory .  (440)
a few years ago , as a journalist 科技类 this race to the heart , thinking about how to get there , like , &quot; the super bowl 冠军赛 , bustling . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of men and women 屈指可数 girls from the old , and that &apos;s not personal health  (442)
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that hundreds of any of the list .  (443)
some are trying to remember the stranger in formation .  (444)
and within a few minutes , to try to put the poetry .  (445)
and in the game , who is the fastest way that the next 一整副 打乱 the sequence .  (446)
i was like , it &apos;s amazing .  (447)
there are other 禀 talent .  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training .  (450)
i said , &quot; ed you when you start to realize that my memory is genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; i don &apos;t do .  (452)
and my memory was .  (453)
to this each one of them will tell you the memory is just generally .  (454)
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall smart 过人 amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really want to in the u.s. national radio britney on how to memorize the order of 一整副 打乱 .  (459)
can that this is that everyone can do . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me !  (461)
we had to find a person , why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very strange way 序幕 out in front of me .  (463)
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called e. p .  (466)
he had a amnesia his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember my amnesia is really amazing .  (468)
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can learn in which the memory of shape our personality .  (469)
the other side of the time i met this one .  (470)
his name is kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; role in .  (472)
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library back to phone books , i think is just fascinating .  (473)
and i went back home and i read and write papers about memory in the paper 两千多年 ago in latin , written in the middle ages , until then , during the  (474)
and i learned a lot of really interesting things .  (475)
one is used to train may beam that memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people want it to your memories could 不遗余力 to your mind .  (477)
these technologies for modern life possible , but also we change .  (478)
not just in the culture , i think it &apos;s about .  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to remember , sometimes think we have about how to memory .  (480)
in this piece of the earth has very few places that makes you think people still interested in training may beam that memory . it &apos;s a very memory .  (481)
it &apos;s not that extraordinary to do this all over the world .  (482)
i was obsessed with this thought , you know , how are these people .  (483)
a few years ago london at the university of a team of researchers asked to a contest to study memory .  (484)
they want to figure out the human brain , we do to others in anatomically structure different ?  (485)
the answer is no .  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the challenges of our brain . there &apos;s a really interesting is that the different .  (489)
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory number or 人脸 or kind pattern , researchers found that memory . there are brain to activate , where people don &apos;t .  (490)
notice that they think , is on the brain in space , memory and navigation , took .  (491)
why ? what can we have to look like ?  (492)
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective way of memory show 赛场 and other people have to catch up  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore won three times the memory there .  (494)
and he &apos;s 台前 三十六副 打乱 card , and in order to an hour down with all that is a he actually invented , but only he would .  (495)
and it &apos;s in this way , he had a word , not bad back down 4140个 any one of binary . only half an hour .  (496)
a cow .  (497)
in the competition of 参赛者 using a lot of different memories of all , to be applied to all the techniques that can to into a concept that psychologists call a delicate code . &quot;  (498)
this idea to use a paradox of humor is perfect interpret baker / baker paradox of simple is that i have two people to remember one word i tell you , &quot; remember , a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
that &apos;s a baker .  (500)
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot;  (501)
after a while back to you and i said , &quot; remember what i call before you remember the word ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what word ? &quot;  (503)
that &apos;s been 人名 baker . remember that word . it &apos;s not as being told a baker , the person .  (504)
the same word of different memories .  (505)
why is it ?  (506)
because there &apos;s no particular 人名 baker .  (507)
can &apos;t tell you a little brain complicated memory make any .  (508)
but as a baker , normally terms , we all know the baker &apos;s .  (509)
baker with funny white cap .  (510)
they hand and ourselves .  (511)
they came home from work with 扑鼻 a toast .  (512)
maybe some of you have a friend &apos;s baker  (513)
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to have all kinds of ways that allow us to a time can still remember .  (514)
this precise memory 两千五百年 skills in front of the ancient greeks have .  (515)
and call it through .  (516)
developed this technique . this is a called simonides poet . he &apos;s going to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he &apos;s been asked to do the performing guest , because in the &apos; cool fancy party . not just d. j. to play reduction , but to please poet ode to .  (518)
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all the people who died .  (519)
not all deaths , all of them are going to come down on 面目全非  (520)
no one said to them what are some people say , who didn &apos;t have to tell who sat where  (521)
the body can &apos;t get to the right place 殉葬  (522)
and then this reinforce the whole thing is color .  (523)
simonides as standing outside of the site of the close your eyes , had suddenly awakened to realize that in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 are sitting .  (524)
he was hold the hand of the relative to the site and they brought up to us .  (525)
it had suddenly awakened simonides 醒悟 things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we are not remember my phone number or . every instructions that we all have very keen visual or space memory .  (526)
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i just simonides story about 10 years ago , &quot; don &apos;t have a few people will remember .  (527)
but i bet , if i show you now in the back of your sitting in the foyer . to speak now , the 骏马 who you know , i &apos;m just saying .  (528)
this advice from 两千多年 ago , the first latin .  (529)
so this phrase . what ?  (530)
if you were invited to stand on the ted stage , and you want to talk to 脱稿 as 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the talk , and he would do 霸气 go one , and you want .  (531)
you have to do is to imagine myself standing in front their  (532)
and imagine working with a completely crazy memorable here to remind you come up to the first thing is that it was creepy a ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry . ed , sitting on the back .  (534)
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook .  (535)
and then you have a mind britney 小甜甜 . you &apos;ll remember to talk about britney that little story .  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth issue is that you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association  (537)
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just the only reciting 添麻烦 but remember , one by one .  (538)
that phrase , &quot; and &quot; quote is from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is 古时候 people talk about rhetorical , or in the space .  (540)
&quot; the phrase , &quot; which means that your memory through the 第一层  (541)
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that a lot of interest .  (542)
and then i went to more memory .  (543)
i started 萌发 a more detailed it that the memory of my culture .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory . it &apos;s boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there .  (547)
the most exciting moment , don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing !  (549)
i know that the human brain must be 惊涛骇浪 as 外人 , but i can &apos;t see  (550)
and i realized that if i really think about that you have to have that experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes to do something .  (552)
there &apos;s a little back .  (553)
back in 跳蚤市场 back , i bought in 年鉴 old people .  (554)
i was surprised to find it very 带劲  (555)
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise  (556)
it &apos;s goal is not to train memory .  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working to create the very funny 胡乱 is better with unforgettable images .  (558)
and it became my .  (559)
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a 耳塞 a 护目镜 all 镜面 hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the biggest attention that is the enemy .  (561)
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story 竞 赛场 .  (562)
i want to drive a signed up to it as an experiment in the news .  (563)
when i thought to be in the 前言 调侃 it yourself .  (564)
the question is , experiment with the unexpected consequences .  (565)
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important .  (567)
these are the usual tricks .  (568)
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles .  (569)
don &apos;t have to really build memory palace , or what the sequence of the 几副 , and you can actually from understanding how brains work in something to do .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think that other people &apos;s gift 禀 it is not .  (571)
powerful memory is can acquire .  (572)
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember  (573)
engaged , can remember  (574)
memory palace , or the memory skills are just 捷径 .  (575)
and they really can &apos;t be 捷径  (576)
this work is because it forces you to think about  (577)
it forces you to go deeper to make you more focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to the training  (578)
it doesn &apos;t 捷径 .  (579)
this is what we have to remember things .  (580)
i found that we experience with your own body 潜藏 the amazing memory .  (581)
but if you want to live memorable do is to remember that a lot of people .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
and who lee duke 沃斯 : success ? willpower .  (584)
on my 27th , and i left a very challenging career -- business management , to turn it into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i came to a new york city public schools to teach seven grade math .  (586)
and the other teachers , i &apos;m going to give students do little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
when these 试卷 and homework open up , and i do their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst students , the only difference between .  (590)
some of the great in 课业 that students don &apos;t have a very high iq points .  (591)
some very smart kids , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 .  (592)
this got me thinking .  (593)
and of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like rates , a number , the area of the 四边形 parallel computation .  (594)
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , and they would spend time and effort .  (595)
and after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in terms of education , we need to learn from the perspective and psychological level , the students and learning . take a more profound understanding .  (596)
in education systems , we know it , which is the best student iq , but if you &apos;re in school , and the good life do not just as easily efficient depend on your ability to learn ?  (597)
all i left the stage , back to school and entered a master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids , and the people in the very challenging circumstances , and the instruments , work , and the question is , who &apos;s success , why do they do it ?  (599)
and i and my research group to point out 西点 research .  (600)
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live the training , which will be tolerated zone out .  (601)
we see the first to build a word , and try to predict what kids can level-up to the end of the game .  (602)
we study in hostile environment for work , just go in teacher , ask them to the teachers in the end of the academic year to stay 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve school students .  (603)
we work with 私企 , to ask them what sales people can stay in .  (604)
what can the more money ?  (605)
in all the different context , a character , no one out of that , in which largely predicted success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
not beautiful appearance , robust . and it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on .  (610)
tenacity is a sustainable 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is you for the future , with every day is not just for a week or a month , but a few years , and for decades trying to make their dream a reality .  (612)
tenacity is put life as a marathon , and it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in the public school , i started to research that willpower .  (614)
i &apos;m going to the 千名 初中生 willpower on the survey , and waiting for more than a year , to see what the students to college .  (615)
and it &apos;s not just in 西点 point , or in the competition to build the words that willpower . in school , it &apos;s true , especially for those in 徘徊 drop out of the kids .  (616)
for my own self , about tenacity me the most astonishing thing is heading for willpower . we cognitive , to develop willpower , the science to understand that was how poor .  (617)
and there are all parents and teachers to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ?  (619)
and what they get a is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know , talent and can &apos;t make you gritty heart .  (622)
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , which we look at the data , tenacity , usually with other factors , and off , even with the brilliance scale run counter .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard about the kids to be tough , the most effective called &quot; growth model for thinking . &quot;  (625)
the 卡洛杜 at stanford university , with a view , and he believed in people &apos;s ability to learn to be , and as you try to change the way .  (626)
professor 杜威克 means , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain , and it facing challenges , what was happening and grew up , what they fail , more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe it would have failed .  (627)
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
and so i decided i close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
this is what this kind of work .  (631)
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do that .  (632)
we need to measure whether it &apos;s all this success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in again and again .  (633)
in other words , we just have to become more tenacity to let our children to become more willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
泽维尔 dimensions , that the : into the building .  (636)
as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , and to think about , building and the environment , and around and around the building and the environment , the relationship between the traditional cultures .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea .  (638)
this is two examples of the country , a in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
one of these cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall .  (641)
this is my team and i was the same for example , we were asked to design into this way .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is , i don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
look at the same in this kind of architecture , the city -- it &apos;s a lot of this kind of building -- we found that the most important three questions .  (644)
first of all , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , they are not the big brands .  (645)
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to on the outside , because architecture is of course , the design to heat trapped in a building , and inside that we need a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in the city , because the cities climate is very 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. .  (647)
the third problem is that the building looks like in a relationship or ethiopia didn &apos;t .  (648)
for a cultural 底蕴 so many cities , it &apos;s called us down .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was a local 集贸市场 was mesmerized . . every day , hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the outside environment , from 小商贩 in all sorts of to buy products .  (650)
it &apos;s the idea is the same , is that the outdoor public setting the idea of creating all kinds of activity .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary architecture 贯彻 多层 of these ideas ?  (653)
the second challenge is , when we started designing , this is a fast cities in the photo , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building on the context of two parallel , in the street , and there are no 几百米 little can connected .  (655)
so we need to do is we use all of this very building a portal , to connect these two way up .  (656)
and then we have a gradient of 庭 design , create an open the space , and this design by its own shape to avoid the pedestrians are 日晒雨淋 .  (657)
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same .  (658)
i think , the question is , the walls of the building . how ?  (659)
and i really want to find a patterns , to design for the environment .  (660)
and i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole made out of cement , to be able to use a controlled by the way , and the light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we from ethiopia beautiful women on the pattern of traditional dress get inspiration .  (662)
these forms that contains a geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to this question , of course the outside walls .  (663)
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air , and by the way we control into the building .  (664)
in order to do this , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night .  (665)
these ideas , but we don &apos;t start building , and they moved , sort of like , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all know , this design solutions than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop .  (667)
and this the design of the wall , by a ton of cost , not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of the air conditioning to control .  (668)
and eventually , we also save a part of the budget .  (669)
where is the first question is , how do we make sure that the building in power , because we live in cities , almost every day -- just 闸 electricity .  (670)
so we were on the roof of the solar panels .  (671)
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in the solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , to be here in cities , 小憩 oasis for people .  (672)
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the interior of clean .  (673)
we &apos;ve built to 第五层 , we &apos;re in the next year , well .  (674)
the second example for the tunisian town planning a over 2000套 an apartment buildings and collateral infrastructure .  (675)
to scale this project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i &apos;m not a very deep need to understand the tunisian city , and she also need to understand all kinds of tradition and culture .  (676)
and in the process , i kind of being a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a structure , over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure , there are 12 相互之间 through the door , almost straight to the path .  (677)
when i started in the graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets , to the 12 primary small areas out there in size , and we are the kind of our in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning .  (678)
these blocks in planning basis , had mentioned idea , we have a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , to change a model .  (679)
the last step is to think about it in the areas of the design of the building , it was kind of a cubicle , made a fundamental part of this plan .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking , for a in the mediterranean climate apartment , what kind of them is the best ?  (681)
and the answer is , can use to 南北朝 house 南北 on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we do this pattern , and all the apartments all have the perfect towards .  (683)
this is that we design , it &apos;s like , a city with work together , the european style of the house .  (684)
some of the building , there &apos;s a garden , and walk around on the ground to the whole together .  (685)
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management service , 上层建筑 population density of high , the population density is not very expensive .  (686)
and she &apos;s for us to connect to 通性 between a portal .  (687)
this is the roof of the project i &apos;d 得意 part , it &apos;s like to be the building the space , and take back to the community .  (688)
the community can climb to the roof , and poke somebody talk about god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or in the back and forth between jump .  (689)
some of these cases have in common , the design process with the same way .  (690)
again , they were in the city , you can see the little 拔地而起 building material .  (691)
in cities , architecture for people , and on the present and future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate .  (692)
for this reason , i think about the architectural design , the more important in between , which is , searching for simple solutions , and cheap enough to enhance and for the local people , and the relationship between the urban environments make people , and that &apos;s good to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said that the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche .  (697)
i think there are three things like that .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus .  (699)
the second one is : what we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is the task , we should rebuild 信任感 .  (701)
i think people to use this task , and it has the wrong way .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , and it was a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think that &apos;s really 信任感 down , but that is , in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing .  (706)
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls , polls that should be in decline in 信任感 out .  (708)
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this idea .  (709)
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe it &apos;s press and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and 20 years ago is highly trust people like that , and the nurse , still get level of trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in the society 居中 people , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
poll records , of course , is that some people .  (714)
or you can record polls ?  (715)
but that &apos;s a general way , you ask them what , they say .  (716)
you trust their politicians ? trust ?  (717)
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
you trust to sell fish ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart you ask .  (722)
when you understand what is the , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people , not in some other people . &quot;  (723)
a very rational answer .  (724)
in short , in our real life , we &apos;re in a different way of looking for trust .  (725)
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types , and in particular , the civil servant , official like that , to be kind of this .  (726)
for example , i would say , i believe that a , of course , i know about elementary school teachers to teach them how to read . but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus .  (727)
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers .  (728)
i might believe me , and that love is a drink friends to friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them , he &apos;s a secret to live .  (729)
that &apos;s it .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence is 信任感 from , say , well why poll , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ?  (731)
i think poll is a very bad for 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to think about 信任感 poor judgment .  (732)
second , and how does it matter ?  (733)
that &apos;s what we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think that it was funny .  (735)
it &apos;s not , i think that purpose .  (736)
i would say , and it should be trusted more to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people .  (737)
in fact , i mean , it was trying not to trust not trusted people .  (738)
for example , who put themselves to earn that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money to roll out 麦道 夫 people , and i think , yeah , who said that , right , so easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
and very clever to trust to choose not to trust that that &apos;s the purpose .  (741)
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important not to trust , but reputation of ?  (742)
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy .  (743)
i think , to make decisions about the need to think about three things .  (744)
to see if they ? it allows you to be honest , whether reliable ?  (745)
if we think that one is that allows you to , in his own area is allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe that they , because they can trust .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not , and they go to help me to send messages , because they &apos;re forget .  (748)
i &apos;m a very confident friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident .  (749)
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to reliable , and it &apos;s not very honest .  (750)
perhaps there , i haven &apos;t found .  (751)
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation of .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so , of course it &apos;s not easy to do .  (754)
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the rules , is to be a professional level or official . and so on and making it easier for us to determine whether a reputation .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that .  (757)
and i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , now the problem is , what i &apos;m going to do a than 手续 接生 a children &apos;s hard . &quot;  (758)
in our public life , our institutions lives , we find a lot of questions . ask to have these institutions in the system to protect his reputation as can be trusted by institutions to see , it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
it allows people to focus on their own work , like 助产士 them , and they take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually had that experience .  (761)
what is going to talk about a lot .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , are attitude , there are not talking about it .  (763)
and thirdly , the task .  (764)
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got a little .  (765)
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust .  (766)
well , we can do it for yourself .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but what &apos;s the matter , trust is unique . it &apos;s from each other .  (770)
you can &apos;t fix people say to you .  (771)
you need to do with trying to make people 家信 let you .  (772)
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people .  (773)
and of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful by , and people know that you are trustworthy .  (775)
how to do that ?  (776)
and every day , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work .  (777)
i give you just a simple , for example , marketing .  (778)
there is a store that i could buy me come back , they never ask any questions .  (779)
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me change color is my favorite socks .  (780)
it &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me feel that they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
and for the people , you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very well be trusted . according to say to yourself , it &apos;s confidence .  (783)
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell .  (784)
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
john 科林 托克斯 : the film manhood .  (787)
now , as the father made me happy , is they like to see the film .  (788)
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter was four years old , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (789)
and then a few months , and she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 .  (791)
and she put yourself in the same look like 仙女 was holding 魔杖 .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you see this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , have a child , all over to a child a fantastic complex world .  (794)
but the 绿野 仙 &quot; 独树一帜 spaces .  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
this is a trend for 40 years later today that the epidemic . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 and a 毛绒绒 guy to mimic the enemy of safeguard to save a girl .  (797)
you know , that &apos;s what the movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different , &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; and we see in recent years , all the film 两三 . there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first of all , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients .  (801)
it &apos;s actually a nasty , like , for instance .  (802)
but i think if we &apos;re taking the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of the people .  (803)
use your magic slippers 巫婆 to beat the military . &quot;  (804)
but , it &apos;s not like that .  (805)
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; -- it &apos;s an image of the most heroic , intelligence , even the bad guys are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; together , realizing that point , and it was a little different .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
and three .  (809)
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him to see .  (810)
but as a second child at home , for his watch it &apos;s sort of a lot .  (811)
and he also run in , and the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck were seen as a duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this film . but he clearly was one of them .  (812)
i &apos;m curious , and he liked this film reasons .  (813)
a subject that film out of courage , tenacity and faithful ?  (814)
also , or 卢克 joins the army , to remove the government ?  (815)
compare 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is how to win ?  (817)
and she told everybody to be a good friend into their leaders .  (818)
and i hope to our children in this environment -- oz world -- up , and not do to up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality .  (819)
why do we show kids movies a lot of violence and little yellow brick way ?  (820)
about men &apos;s violence on film for women , a lot of this article , and you should go to see . ok .  (821)
the atmosphere for boys . i read the article , not that much .  (822)
and my own experience , 从莱娅 are for the environment guide me not to get to experience in real life into adults to children the adult world is &quot; men and women of 混居 . &quot;  (823)
i think , on the screen , beginning to happen in the movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i do a mission , won 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
these films focus on the beat the bad guys get reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 .  (829)
and of course , the example is a lot , and i &apos;ll in front of you for disney princess are defense .  (830)
but these movies for boys , and it &apos;s not all these films .  (831)
the film , there &apos;s a lot of a all because that &apos;s how we teach girls against 父权 society , but these movies , not to show you how to fight boys 父权 society .  (832)
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 .  (833)
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story , like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
and finally , many of you all know , this year , they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i &apos;m going to all of you recommend this film . it was being shown in .  (836)
you remember the first time , &quot; brave project , the criticism ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe it 皮克斯 to do the movies . &quot;  (838)
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , the movie all by , &quot; no , 贝克德 test . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
the test for people who don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do about them .  (842)
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , and she gets recorded her , and a friend in and they saw the movie about it .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)

who were they ? how they were teaching out ?  (869)

muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism .  (890)
i want to tell you a story about a little kid .  (891)
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know him .  (892)
he lives in the south , in a village .  (893)
the village , it &apos;s from the capital 加迪休 .  (894)

and only lived in the town , and that &apos;s the 加迪休 .  (898)
about a year in the past , it &apos;s nothing .  (899)
one day , he had a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch .  (900)
he &apos;s alive with a bunch of people , and he got the rest .  (901)
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes , can give their own native to send money .  (902)
and to give him a young girl .  (903)
and they did .  (904)
he started new life .  (905)
he &apos;s life .  (906)
and one day &apos;s 加迪休 in the sky 碧蓝 there was a car bombing .  (907)
this is the city of my little boy is that the bomb , and when that help dynamic people &apos;s &quot; the party , &quot; a and al qaeda a terrorist organization .  (908)
this little boy just wanted to go through the city through why he is the story of a suicide attack for the end ?  (909)
he actually wait .  (910)
he &apos;s waiting for a chance to wait for the future , and you can move a road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road .  (911)
this is going to be like 成年期 him out of the first encounter .  (912)
and he was in the same story , in the city .  (913)
this is a story about power , unemployment taken from the city of the story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots , they started to get out of 成年期 .  (914)
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means that job opportunities , wealth , but people didn &apos;t have to them in the city .  (915)
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment .  (916)
in 2030 , five people living in cities , there &apos;s three is to 18 these people .  (917)
if we in the city of the development of the young people don &apos;t think , of course , if we don &apos;t give them a chance to give you this story come across 成年期 terrorism and violence and gang these 雷池 is going to be the future of cities .  (918)
i was born in the city &apos;s 加迪休 , 70 percent of the people in unemployment .  (919)
70 percent , no , no book .  (920)
basically do nothing  (921)
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital .  (922)
i remember standing that are full of play in front of an eye hospital , i really think that if i don &apos;t leave it be ?  (923)
if i get to in the same for 成年期 ?  (924)
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ?  (925)
and i did say no .  (926)
last month , i went &apos;s 加迪休 . it &apos;s going to have a young business leadership and the summit .  (927)
i brought about 90 somalia to lead  (928)
we sat down and working together , they have a solution to the biggest problem .  (929)
and one of the room called aden young people .  (930)
he &apos;s in the 加迪休 university and graduated .  (931)
and there &apos;s no chance to work .  (932)
and i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , it was sort of &quot; the party , &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit .  (933)
the people that look like this .  (934)
but the story , it &apos;s another version .  (935)
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and the great barrier is the  (936)
23 years of civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , it actually became the easy-to-use tools .  (937)
aden find opportunities and grab on it .  (938)
he built a motorcycle company .  (939)
actually , to a cab to the people who couldn &apos;t afford motorbikes .  (940)
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆  (941)
he &apos;s story about how different ?  (942)
that &apos;s what makes the difference ?  (943)
i believe , is it going to find opportunities and opportunity .  (944)
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is waiting for 成年期 with the most effective tool .  (945)
and he drove the young people as they had been crazy searching for economic opportunity makers  (946)
you can put people into training .  (947)
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me , i have a meeting , he called mohamed mohamoud is a 名花 business .  (948)
he was to train in my business summit part of the young people how to grow them how to create new business .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; you see what &apos;s the flowers , ? &quot; for a lot of was born in civil wars , who was the answer is going to be , &quot; never seen before . &quot;  (950)
so mohamed from that opportunity .  (951)
he started a 园林 and greening with the design company .  (952)
he &apos;s 加迪休 go out on a piece of agriculture , and he started to grow tulip and 百合花 and he said that it &apos;s been to a bad 加迪休 climate .  (953)
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in town , business and busy . now he &apos;s busy building 加迪休 22年 &apos;s the first people to park .  (954)
now , there &apos;s no 加迪休 in &apos;s citizens of the park .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for family young people together , to here , as he said , to feel and enlightenment 花香 rose .  (956)
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire the young people and in that room , mohamed of young people to come here , very deep .  (958)
they don &apos;t want to business .  (959)
they have to work for civil society organizations work for government , but in this case , he of innovation , for those people very much .  (960)
he makes these young people have the opportunity to reframe the city .  (961)
he makes them think they can be entrepreneurs can be changing the world .  (962)
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky .  (963)
they came up with a business solution to local problems .  (964)
so young companies to create a culture is big step across , but people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business .  (966)
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them from idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for the city .  (967)
for me , entrepreneurship is not just business on  (968)
it &apos;s about creating social impact .  (969)
and it &apos;s not just sold doctor-heroes  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , it can truly change people to the city .  (972)
on the side of the street aden hired to help him a cab and help keep the motorcycle  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to was to get to escape from 成年期 .  (974)
these young . all right , they have a profound impact on the city .  (975)
so my suggestion is that move more young people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then there &apos;s more about the story of the park , and it &apos;s not the car bomb 成年期 and wait .  (976)
thank you .  (977)

the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how we can tackle this wall , and to understand that language , and look at this complex elegant , where people can do this .  (982)
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way to learn the chinese word for it .  (983)
from five up , and i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book .  (984)
fifteen years , during the day , i have to learn a new the chinese word for .  (985)
