jay meg : why 30 is not new 20 . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need psychiatric patient treatments . 
when i was a college in berkeley read clinical psychologist . they 3d students . 
she was a woman named alex 26 . 
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the directly into my office , sit in on the couch , kick off her shoes , and she said to me , is to tell me about men &apos;s question . 
when i heard this , i disengaged . 
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk about my boys . 
i thought i could manage this thing . 
but i can &apos;t do that . 
alex in every meeting , will bring funny story , so to me 点点 head out on , and the result of the time is a very relaxing things . 
alex would say , &quot; this is a new 20th , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later , to have to have children later , even after death is to have . 
and i was just like alex 二十几岁 people outside , except for nothing . 
but not too long , i started to push it on my 催 alex love life . 
i refuse . 
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists call &quot; and so ! &quot; moment . 
in that moment , i learned 30 is not new 二十岁 . 
yeah , people more than ever late 安顿 down , but it doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between her development 低谷 . 
this makes alex 二十几岁 development of a good time , and we sat spoil it . 
and then i understood that &quot; kindness &quot; oversight is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love for life around 二十几岁 people with the family . 
now , america had about 5千万 二十几岁 people . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think about nobody can &apos;t experience 二十几岁 stage in this case after adults period . 
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand . 
i really want to see here 一些二十几岁 people . 
excellent ! you &apos;re awesome . 
if you work with 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people and lost o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people , very important . 
this is not my point . it &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime 80 percent of the most important moment occurred in 35 years old . 
that means every 10 determines your life would be the kind of experience with &quot; and it turns out that there are eight of ! &quot; moment occurred in 30 中旬 . 
over 40 years , who don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money you will make a very big impact . 
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 before and mate 终生 married , 同居 , or on a date . 
we know in your brain when 二十几岁 adults to adapt to the second issue is the last time into a long-term peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change yourself , what is now change its time . 
we know life than other stages when 二十岁 personality of the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit , 35 years old and that &apos;s a little hard to do . 
so you this 二十几岁 between is tell your own body situation and the choice of the time . 
so when we talk about children &apos;s development , we all know about five years before language and admiration brain development is the critical period . 
this is a your daily life will produce for your future impact time period . 
but we hear a few is have something called adults development , and our 二十岁 this stage is adult development of the critical period . 
but this is not 二十几岁 people heard . 
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change . 
researchers have called 二十几岁 extending adolescence . 
journalist for 二十几岁 stupid people additional names , like , &quot; the guardian &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , we get is actually adults 期中 known as the most important decades doesn &apos;t matter . 
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , you need a plan and not enough time . 
this is not right ? 
so , when you take a 二十几岁 people heads and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start lifestyle , &quot; what happens when you think ? 
nothing happens . 
you take that guy and urgency worked , but nothing happened . 
or &quot; everybody says to me at 30 just before i started my career , no problem . &quot; this kind of thing . 
but then they start : &quot; my 二十岁 quickly ended , but nothing i can show . 
i graduated day best 写写 my résumé . &quot; 
and then they start : &quot; when 二十几岁 date like playing games in seats . 
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but to about 30 music is cut off a after another , you start to sit down . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &apos; &apos; chair . &quot; 
here are 二十几岁 where ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
okay , that just might sound like a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , in this very high currency . 
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
there are many of these things are not compatible , and started studying like that , in this phase 三十几岁 and do so many things harder pressure and it &apos;s too big . 
on a millennium after middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy . 
that is our profession doesn &apos;t want to . 
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or cannot give their kids a sibling . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people do and what we think . 
let me tell you a story about how to do . 
this is a story about a woman called emma story . 
25 , emma because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at . 
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she showed that worked 脾气 more and more than my boyfriend live together . 
and whether she 二十几岁 how hard it is , her life was much more difficult . 
she was meeting , crying , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walks in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took one morning fill her connect people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this string of words -- &quot; the blank behind . 
she almost 歇斯底里 of looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who would take care of me ? &quot; 
now , i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her treatment architect . 
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex stuff , right after i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make a decision that emma role decade that flow off . 
so in the next weeks and months , i taught in every three emma 二十几岁 people , both men and women are supposed to hear things . 
first , i told emma forget her identity crisis and started accumulate identity capital . 
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value . 
do you think about this , and what it was like investment . 
i didn &apos;t know emma profession future , and nobody knows their work future , but i know those : identity capital would come to employ more identity capital . 
this is a professional accept that multinational , internships that job and you want to step up to the time . 
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to speak , cannot called exploration . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count . 
secondly , i told emma cities tribes overestimate . 
the new capital , the new can get almost always about people from inside the external communities . 
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends . 
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment . 
but half is not that connection is weak , and put yourself in a group that way . 
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connecting to your neighbor boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 working methods . 
this is not cheating . this is information about how to communicate science . 
and finally , emma believe that people don &apos;t choose a family , but we can choose friends . 
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people &apos;s emma , soon to pass and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family . 
i tell emma choice family time is now . 
you might think , is a 30 than 20 , 25 is even better off of the time , and i agreed . 
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your or 同居 sleep people don &apos;t call progress . 
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which means to treat love is treated as rich work like that . 
choice family is conscious choices that you want people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose your person waste of time . 
and then emma how ? 
well , we went back into the address thin , and she found her an old roommate a family in another state of an art museum work . 
the weak connection to help her where you find a job . 
and that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons . 
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and her doctor consciously chose people get married . 
she loved her new career , she loved his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 fence seems a big enough . &quot; 的卡 pieces . 
emma stories make this thing that sounds very simple , but this is my favorite and 二十几岁 people work reasons . 
it &apos;s too easy to help them . 
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport destination somewhere in the west flights . 
after the launch , vector adjust is a little further and further in alaska in fiji difference . 
likewise , at 21 or even 25 29岁 , it &apos;s a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 down is that even a few generations have very big impact . 
this gives a worth spreading give each of you know who 二十几岁 ideas . 
it and i learned to follow alex saying as simple . 
are you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re in determines your life . 
thank you . 
李镇河 : 李镇河 into computer : &quot; real world , you play &quot; infinite imagination 
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , we still have a reality and virtual worlds . gap between the virtual world , our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap in shortens and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap to shorten less than one millimeter , is a touchscreen glass that thin , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between how much better ? 
so i started to try this crazy idea . 
i first built out of this tool , it can number into space , if you compare this with a pen that force on the screen , and a pen pen and goes into a little pixels of virtual worlds . 
designers directly in three-dimensional space to achieve their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery . 
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of borders between . 
but we still &apos;s hands on the screen . 
how can we reach into to communicate with digital information interaction , and use our flexible hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 re-engineered this computer put keyboard on top of a small space move into the number of jobs . 
because in reality window and file space with a particular location , they pick become like from the shelves take book so easily . 
and you can read this book and floating in every window and virtual touch board out across words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands or stretched rotate all kinds of models . 
in these examples have shown that we &apos;re now entering the digital world . 
but how we can change its position to make digital information into our world ? 
that many people here have online shopping and 退货 experience . 
but now than you don &apos;t worry about . 
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 in line . 
this is the system we analyzed body geometric features later , driving through the first football or a way to look at that show us situations . 
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make our space these visible pixels points into actually can touch it , to feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve 雷米 persian , common to make it a &quot; matter pixels points . &quot; 
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 like we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and people will move the object into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place . 
we make the basic principles are , to eliminate gravity pellets role magnetically levitated , and through mechanical sense , technology and drive it together to control pellets movement . 
right through this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to liberate time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , people could movement in the physical world , can be recorded , back and forever , keep . 
so , dance 编排 can be remote and real to teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 movement , and you can actually being repeated itself . 
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , is this learning process is real , you can touch it , it felt , was to force . 
more exciting is that this is not the computer put things into a real stuff , but to imagine , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity . 
and as you can see , digital information will just make things that give us , but will start acts as we become part of our physical environment , not cut our relationship with the real world . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; border &quot; from the beginning , if we could remove the border , the rest is our enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
&apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 had two 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years . 
when i was in elementary school one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , when i was in elementary school one grade , the government wanted me to 转学 体校 , all free . 
my mother said , &quot; no , the tiger . &quot; 
my parents , and i hope they elephants as long as engineers . i want my parents were elephants as long as engineers . 
as 文革 survivor , they only get -- think happiness is a reliable way of 高薪 work . 
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter . 
but i dream is becoming 黄梅戏 actor . 
that &apos;s my premise playing the piano . 
戏曲 actors from beginning to learn small 身段 kung fu 戏曲 actor , to start learning from small 身段 kung fu , i want to do everything 黄梅戏 way to go to school . 
even wrote to the principal 戏校 with a radio host . 
but no one big people love that idea . 
no one big people believe that i &apos;m serious . 
i only have they 小伙伴 supportive , but they also a child , and i like powerless . 
when i was 15 , i know i &apos;ve learned to play age too big . 
my dream is no longer be possible . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in their life is to get some 二流 happiness . your life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ah ! my god . 
i decided to our search for dark another mission . 
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learned from the book . 
( &quot; 三毛 全集 &quot; and &quot; 南怀瑾 historical experience -- &quot; i 1995 , to the united states in america , i first read what book ? 
of course , is china 禁书 . 
the earth about &quot; is china farmers story . 
you &apos;re not really convenient propaganda . okay . 
bible interesting , but also very strange . 
the topic 他日 talk again . 
but the ten commandments fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my heart moving , &quot; a privilege &quot; not equal and farther than &quot; submission . &quot; 
it became i climbed out 儒家 负罪感 tools , it became i climbed out 儒家 负罪感 tool to rebuild , my relationship with their parents . 
to a new culture and environment , as i read habits , compared to a new culture and environment , as i read a habit . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , when i first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from small to large use world map . 
never before i realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily need to map , central in the world . 
this map with some perspective . 
compare reading is not new . 
it &apos;s in academia standard approach . 
比较文学 , even more religious become specialized . field 比较文学 , even more religious become specialized research . 
compare and contrast scholars for a project has a full understanding . contrast to control scholars for a project has a full understanding . 
i wonder , as compared with reading on useful , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ? 
so i started putting books to read about it . 
they can be about the same events different parties , they can be about the same events different parties , or two friends have shared experience . 
jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desire and fear and social responsibility -- interesting . 
if you understand the language , take your favorite books of two versions read versus language is very interesting . 
so thomas 默 translation . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 de watts translation of the moral approaching . &quot; ) people often say it &apos;s always a translator lost , i actually found translation can lead to harvest . 
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning it &apos;s called rapid joy , &quot; well ... 
&quot; bride chinese word for the literal meaning &quot; it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
i had become a book with an amazing discovery communication 今人 portal , has become my book with an amazing discovery communication 今人 portal . 
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless . 
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , not dream 破灭 than anything . 
i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true isn &apos;t the only purpose . 
its purpose is the most important for us to touch the dream sources of places where the source , passion , happiness sources of places . 
even a broken 灭 dreams can get your experiencing that touch . 
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , live happily life of purpose and meaning , to become clear , in most of the time . 
hope always books also with you at any age . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
john 帕鲁尔 塞加尔 : 颂歌 envy . 
when i was eight , new classes to a woman , she was so striking , like all the girls to have a new way . 
she had a big put the 光泽 秀发 a cute little 文具盒 specialize remember week capital in a name that no one can than spell . 
my whole year that people were envy constant , until i figured out that evil plan . 
one day i came from school , and the second 逗留 actually pretty to stay late , i &apos;ve been silently sit on female toilets 
and at that time , i would go from a 出动 classroom teachers table scores for it . 
and then i win by stopping conspiracy . 
and i change my opponents scores only changed to a certain point , just wait 降级 . 
well , it &apos;s all a &apos;s . 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other students scores high also getting awfully ! 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all people and creative nothing but score . 
i gave everyone kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line in this because i &apos;ve got to do some more radical . 
now i don &apos;t understand my behavior . 
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out . 
i don &apos;t understand why do when they &apos;re very good 
i was feeling great . 
i don &apos;t understand why i had never been found 
i mean , this obvious thing to do . 
i hasn &apos;t been found . 
but it &apos;s important , so why i care about this girl , in this tiny little girls so good at spell ? this point i keep baffled . 
let me envy baffled . 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that babies are jealous of torture 
also know primates envy , blue 知更鸟 very comfortable envy 
we know is envy american spouses murder agents . 
but i never read an article research could explain , &quot; &quot; jealous of lonely its lasting exist , or it &apos;s cruel stimulation . 
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study &quot; envy , &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
well , i don &apos;t know this is not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have a literary ? 
if not 忠 ocean &apos;s , &quot; there is no odyssey . &quot; 
no where 妒忌 king , there is no &quot; 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we have high school reading 书单 because we &apos;re losing the 喧嚣 riots were lost . &quot; and &quot; remarkable &quot; is gates than the sun rises , &quot; are losing the &quot; madame 包法利 &quot; anna 卡列琳 nathalie . &quot; 
no , no 普鲁斯 jealous . now , i mean , i know people always say , love 普鲁斯 know anything , but said he was really jealous of this thing better understand . 
this is his whole 追忆 巨著 &quot; water &quot; 年华 一百周年 this piece is about sex jealous of the research also clear that we can think of common 竞争性 is that in me . 
when we think we would expect , 普鲁斯 those emotions details , right ? 
we want to a small boy is 入梦 
in a piece of cake 玛德琳 薰 衣草茶 . 
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye . 
he &apos;s not how cool compassion 
these books in virginia de 伍尔夫 seems like a cat gut . 
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it as 坚 顽石 . 
let &apos;s look at these things came together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and jealous with envy 普鲁斯 there . 
妒忌 comes down to people , desire , from a true narrative firm foundation is not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it profoundly push our sensitive nerve because just think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we get jealous , we &apos;ll make myself a story . 
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they are supposed to let the &apos;d suffered . 
we tell ourselves as stories , and the audience know exactly where to join the details where fatal in 一刀 . right ? 
let &apos;s be both amateurs and novelist 普鲁斯 , can understand this . 
all she did make me happy thing will give people happy maybe now is going on ? &quot; 
this is what he started myself to knit story and 普鲁斯 portraits , he discovered lover , every millions of a new glamour is he &quot; sexual 虐 密室 together in a series of tools . &quot; 
now we have to admit , and 斯万 普鲁斯 , two people envy infamous heart . 
you know , there were my boyfriend 普鲁斯 . if you want to tell him that 分手 to escape from this country . 
but you don &apos;t need so jealous will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
let &apos;s body 疲 its time . 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , must get satisfied . 
envy like ? 
envy love information . 
like detail . 
like a big put 光泽 秀发 cute 文具盒 . 
like envy . 
it &apos;s so instagram fire . 
it will actually 普鲁斯 academic with envy language 相联 language . 
when the million struggle in his jealous of a sudden he started standing in front of him to bribe 偷听 lover servants &apos; quarters his defense for this behavior . 
he said , &quot; hey , i know you think this annoying , but it and interpret a 古文 or watching a monument two nothing . &quot; 
he said , &quot; these are the scientific research , a real knowledge value . &quot; 
shame , grief , loss : these are all the way , 普林斯 wisdom 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a let our pain woman has given us all emotions than , let &apos;s interested in a genius can have more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel woman ? 
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what themselves . 
there is no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotion would allow us to see their hostility , your intentions ugly heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that wrote that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think his wife disobedience . he &apos;s so 憔悴 ours 
freud think this guy kind of weird because he doesn &apos;t really concerned with his wife do anything . 
because his wife was innocent , you all know . 
this poor guys just 缘由 to have any doubts 
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move . 
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she was really mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it should be able to describe envy novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right . 
well , we get jealous more intense , we will be more frequently fantasy . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do violence or anything illegal . 
envy causes us behavior becomes extreme . 
i admit that i got myself when i was eight , but also in the news came to see a story . 
michigan 一个52岁 women were discovered register a facebook account phony-baloney and used to account for their year sending out the malicious news . 
a year . for one year . 
she &apos;s trying to her 陷害 before the aisles now girlfriend i must admit , when i heard this , and my reaction is for she admired 
because , i want to say , you face reality . 
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , isn &apos;t it ? 
this is from a novel . 
a pie 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel . 
海史密斯 is my favorite writers and 
she is american 文学史 on brilliant and 诡 one page . 
for example , tom universal interest in her case , the most famous character . 
you want to start 里普利 or want what you have to be , then you , and you have you ever have locked in his basement 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but we do ? we cannot repeat 里普利 road . 
i cannot tell the world has dramatically , even if i would one day be able to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in admire era . 
we live in envy era . 
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , isn &apos;t it ? 
we can give novel solutions , i &apos;m not sure ? 
so we &apos;ll 学学 fictional characters , they look at the met puzzles , when things don &apos;t know how to do . 
let &apos;s go back to ask the 贝克街 221 夏洛克 de 福尔摩斯 b . 
when people think 福尔摩斯 would want to his adversaries mo 里亚蒂 professor this crime genius 
but i &apos;ve been more like an epidemic 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face a scottish 头子 he really needed to 福尔摩斯 his intelligence , but hate him . 
oh , i had not familiar with this again . 
雷斯 垂 de he needs help , and he hated the mystery of the cases 侦破 always 苦闷 story again . 
we proud of you . &quot; 
it said in the field , nobody would not want to hold hands 福尔摩斯 
this is what we saw 少数几次 福尔摩斯 in the human being moved , and when i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it seems to envy as a geometric problem , instead of emotions . 
this minute , standing 福尔摩斯 雷斯 垂 de opposite 
the next minute they stand on one side . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he used to hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if it was really jealous of a geometric problem to do , a story about how we choose your relationship with other questions ? 
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate somebody talent . 
we &apos;ll chase effort . 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when we come to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction 
fiction is already going on with envy 
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it , please . 
look at it and who are called came : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy shree millions , still has 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there myself . 
we have excellent partners . 
thank you . 
ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash . 
i was 10 or so , once and dad went up to 阿第伦 chris camp . that &apos;s a mountain in the new york northern wild zone . 
it was really good weather . 
the forest searched twinkling lights . 
next shine sunlight , like leaves , when from the 晶莹 stained glass -- little feet , if there &apos;s no way , we can actually is at first we pretend that this piece of the human . 
we eventually arrived at our camp . 
that &apos;s on a cliff camp , overlooking a 水晶 next to a beautiful 晶莹 lakes . then i actually found a bad thing . 
and in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 the largest garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apples nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing . 
people to camp was too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would clean 善后 for them ? 
this question bedeviled at all . i became a longer sound bite . 
who cleaned the trash to leave us ? 
but you can take this issue on any place you live in cloth 伊斯坦 . we leave out the garbage ? 
in rio cleaned we leave the garbage ? in paris and london ? 
in new york , here , is sanitation trucks were parked department cleaned up to 11 , we leave 000吨 trash every day , and the 2000吨 recycled garbage . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know who are doing this work . 
wear sanitation trucks were parked on this up in a sense of responsibility for what ? 
so i started a about sanitation trucks were parked workers research project . 
i was sitting in the car , and along the track , interview in new york all the sanitation trucks were parked office workers live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not sitting in 垃圾车 , i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 . 
my own manipulate the electric 扫帚 scanners street , in the snow 铲 . 
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process . 
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell . 
there is smell , but it &apos;s not what you think that bad . sometimes odor really bad . but you &apos;ll soon will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even a few years of working experience skilled worker , their bodies have adapted to try and weekly megatons of garbage . 
so there is at risk . 
according to labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked jobs in america is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then slowly learned why . 
you all day on the road , which are of traffic . 
out of the car just trying to drive more than you , people often not enough to be careful . 
for the sanitation trucks were parked workers , it was terrible . 
and yet , garbage itself is full of poisons , these 毒物 often from 垃圾车 comes out , in a terrible harm . 
i also learned the brutal and frightening . 
when you go down , 路沿 sanitation trucks were parked car in the city , you &apos;ll see a slowly recognize garbage really like the power of nature itself . 
it &apos;s never 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like breath , or a circular form . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , sanitation trucks were parked by workers called oriental into . 
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important labor . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient day landfill . landfill , from the container itself , bring it to poison in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we attacked several century after decade 和数 diseases will again , we started threaten our health . 
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
if we don &apos;t throw old stuff , we have no space something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less . 
i &apos;m not suggesting that capitalism , here i just pointed out their relationship . 
and the third reason -- is what i call our average and necessary , 经常性 activity speed . 
i mean , in today &apos;s &apos; and days , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , repairing and clean and carried it around our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and they throw away , and forget about them , because we know that there will be a work in teams were sitting over there put these things is densest . 
so today i want to urge you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked workers situation , maybe help that they &apos;re called . please bring them to participate in about how to build a sustainable city thousands of people . 
i think their work is very noble . 
every time they , in the street to individual hard work . 
in many cities , they &apos;re wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work . 
you know , they have to clean garbage on time . 
they are allowing us to secure in their work . 
they almost became secure work promise . 
what they keep working for traffic safety ourselves without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and junk . this work traffic anyway -- to keep stability . 
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks and 咆哮 , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 week doing . 
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy . 
his name was 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends . 
i want to believe 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
cities junk , because we know of garbage actually only about three percent of all domestic garbage . 
this is an amazing data . 
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the garbage , please find a time , 致意 to them . 
find a time to say thank you .

okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;ll give you an annual spring in new york are going to do a weird competition . 
it &apos;s called america 冠军赛 memory . 
a few years ago i as a journalist 科技类 this race to the part about trying to get there , like &quot; geeks who super bowl 冠军赛 as bustling . &quot; 
a bunch of men and women 屈指可数 grew up in some old boy is still not aware of personal health 
just look at some 奋力 in a situation laying down hundreds of any list of numbers . 
some are trying to remember the names of populations strangers . 
some think in the next few minutes trying to put the poetry 
and in the game , who is the fastest way down to remember 一整副 打乱 card sequence . 
i thought it was amazing . 
these people surely talents unlike 禀 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
this guy named ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to accept the best training memory . 
i asked him , &quot; ed is when you start to realize their memories is genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; i &apos;m not experts ? 
i actually very memory . 
to participate for each one of them will tell you just average memory . 
i &apos;m surprised when &quot; whoa , what i &apos;ve never heard ? &quot; 
we stood outside the hall smart 过人 amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really want to teach in the u.s. national radio britney remember how 一整副 打乱 card sequence . 
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
i said , &quot; even though i &apos;m not britney , but you can also teach taught me ! 
we had to find an open to teach people why not ? &quot; 
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 unfold in front of me . 
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he suffers amnesia his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse amnesia themselves don &apos;t remember there really was amazing . 
while he was a tragedy through his character , but we can understand memory in to what extent shape our personality . 
this is another extreme i met somebody like this . 
his name is kim peek 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the movie &quot; rain man &quot; characters in prototype . 
and he took one afternoon in salt lake city public library , back to phone books , i think is just fascinating 
i went home to read a lot to write essays about memory 两千多年 ago in latin wrote papers from ancient until then medieval time 
i learned a lot of interesting things . 
one is used to train illegal beam nurturing memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 people to send in your memories could 不遗余力 to paint your mind . 
these technologies allow modern life possible , but also we changed . 
not only in the culture and i think in cognition 
kids don &apos;t need to memory sometimes think how we already forgot to memory . 
in this piece of the earth has very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam nurturing memory . it &apos;s an extraordinary memory . 
it &apos;s not so extraordinary around the world are starting to do this . 
i want to be obsessed with these people know how to do . 
a few years ago london school of the university of researchers asked to a contest champion accept study memory . 
they want to understand the human brain if we follow each other in structure anatomically different ? 
the answer is no . 
and they are smarter than us ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny conclusion . 
but compared with the goal is to control the brain memory contest champion brain were indeed there &apos;s an interesting question that very different . 
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory number or or 人脸 kind pattern , researchers discovered memory champion challenges of our brain areas activated with no ordinary too . 
notice that they use it in the brain in space and memory , it would take to navigate part . 
why ? what can we figure out what the conclusion ? 
竞争性 memory 较量 by a similar way toward the military competition 白热化 every year , someone with more effective way of memory show 赛场 and other people have to catch up 
this is my friend ben pridmore won three international competition champion memory . 
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 sequence card to him for an hour down to remember all using a kind of his inventions , and he would only have the skills . 
and it &apos;s similar to the way he had a word , not bad back off binary numbers 4140个 arbitrary folding only half an hour . 
very impressive . 
in these 参赛者 competition of using a lot of different memories of different ways of being applied to all these skills will end up going into a concept psychologists call a delicate code . &quot; 
this idea can humor with a paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox simple to say is that i have two people to remember one word i told you say , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot; 
a famous baker . 
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot; 
and over time , i found back you ask , &quot; remember what i call before you remember that term ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what word ? &quot; 
being told is 人名 baker people remember that term potential as far as not being told a baker that person . 
same word cause different memories . 
why is it ? 
because 人名 baker no special meaning 
couldn &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any . 
but as a baker normally nouns that we all know baker &apos;s ? 
baker with funny white cap . 
they hand and flour . 
they came home from work with a 扑鼻 toast . 
maybe some people have a friend &apos;s baker 
we first hear this word , immediately generates all kinds of ways that we can make in after a while , can still remember . 
this precise memory 两千五百年 skills in front of the ancient greeks had it . 
and call it palace memory . 
this invention skills , there &apos;s a process called simonides following the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party 
and he was being asked to do the performing guest because in the &apos; cool fancy party standards isn &apos;t please d. j. to beat reduction , but please poet ode to come . 
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died . 
not all death all of them were to come down on 面目全非 
nobody said to them what are some people who don &apos;t like to tell who sat where 
that causes the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬 
and then reinforce the whole thing tragedy colors . 
simonides as standing outside the rubble only survivors close your eyes thrust upon realizing in his mind his eyes appeared all 宾客 are sitting . 
he would hold hands are relative to the site to bring their loved ones around . 
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 thing about all of you have probably guessed . it &apos;s no matter how much we don &apos;t remember to name phone number or colleagues every instructions that we all have very keen visual or spatial memory capacity . 
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap me just tell the story of the top 10 words simonides should not many people will remember . 
but i bet , if i show you now back down in the foyer . sat will speak brown on 骏马 who is that you see , i just saying . 
this advice from 两千多年 ago latin earliest scholars memory . 
so this phrase principles of what is this ? 
suppose you were invited to stand on the ted stage speech center , and you want to finish 脱稿 as 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome tedx talk on average , he would do 霸气 step one and you want . 
you want to do is to imagine yourself standing in front home 
and imagine working out with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster ed mr. sitting on the back . 
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook 
and then you head comes 小甜甜 britney looks like , you &apos;ll remember to talk about britney that little story . 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is you spent a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association 
this is presenting rome home talk reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just going to just reciting flat 添麻烦 but remember , one by one topic . 
it &apos;s the theme &quot; phrases &quot; quote from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is 古时候 people talk about rhetorical , or will use into space . 
&quot; phrases first &quot; means your memory 第一层 palace . 
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that up a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started a 萌发 more detailed it that my memory rodeo culture . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is memory process is very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there . 
the most exciting moment don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source . 
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing ! 
i know those guys head is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t be seen as 外人 
i realized that if i really think about these things have to have to experience . 
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes and try something memory . 
behind each little poem . 
back in my back 跳蚤市场 bought 年鉴 old people in the names . 
i was surprised to find it very 带劲 
don &apos;t want to try and fundamental surprise 
interesting is actually goal is not going to train improve memory 
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working build those completely comical myth is better 胡乱 unforgettable images . 
and it became my joy . 
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit . 
it &apos;s a whole 镜面 护目镜 耳塞 a hot black left two little holes memory , because the biggest enemies are dispersed attention . 
and i &apos;m reporting back again a year ago 竞 赛场 on that . 
i also want to urge is signed up for that as engagement properties news experiment . 
when i thought to be in the 前言 调侃 it yourself . 
the problem is experiment finally got unexpected consequences 
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or shopping alone is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles . 
don &apos;t have to really build palace or laying down memories of cards 几副 order you can also totally from understanding brains gain some benefits of principles . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 facts is not . 
powerful memory is can acquire . 
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember 
engaged , can remember 
memory palace or that memory skills are just 捷径 . 
and they really are deemed 捷径 
this method works is because it forces you thinking . 
it forces you to go deeper , to want more you focus most people don &apos;t normally painless to this training . 
actually 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist . 
this is what we have to remember things . 
by having experiences that i found that our bodies 潜藏 with an amazing memory capacity . 
but if you want to live memorable do is to remember that often memory . 
thank you . 
who la lee duke 沃斯 : success willpower keys ? 
on my 27th , i resigned as a very challenging career -- business management , counseling and turned into a more challenging professional : education . 
i came to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math . 
and as other teachers , i &apos;ll give students do little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
when these 试卷 homework and open up , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq of ups , is not my best and the worst students , the only difference between . 
some in the 课业 performance good students don &apos;t have very high iq score on . 
some pretty smart kid , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 . 
and this triggered my thinking . 
of course , students in seven grade need to learn that there is hard , like rates , small number of 四边形 area , parallel computation . 
but the concept is completely can be controlled , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , and they would spend time and effort . 
after a few years later , i got a lesson that in terms of education , we need to learn from the dynamic perspective and psychological angle to student learning behavior , and have a more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we all know , evaluating students high standard is iq , but if in schools and the good life do not much depend on your ability to learn more efficient easy ? 
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids and adults are , in various very challenging circumstances , and in studies of treaties , my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they succeeding ? 
i and my research group to point out 西点 research . 
we try to predict what tolerance fellow to be elected to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out . 
before we went to see the national together words , race also try to predict what kids can level-up at the end game . 
our research , working in hostile environment work , just go in teacher , ask them to decide what a teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 them , and those who can really quickly increased student learning grades . 
we work with 私企 , to ask them what they could sell to work . 
what can earn most ? 
in all these different context , a character , no one out of this feature in a very large extent predicted success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
it &apos;s not nice appearance , robust , . it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and persist . 
tenacity is have perpetual 恒 something happened . 
tenacity is you about the future , with every day is not just for a week or a month , but a few decades effort and struggle for their dream a reality . 
tenacity is put life as a marathon and it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower . 
i was on 千名 初中生 conducted about willpower survey of waiting for a year , and more , to see what ultimately graduate students can . 
everything is not just in 西点 point or in the competition to build the words that willpower . in schools is also true , especially for those 徘徊 dropout on the edge of the kids . 
for my own self , about willpower me the most astonishing thing is heading for willpower , we develop willpower , cognitive science , in the understanding that was how poor . 
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and what they move the long-term is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t allow you to gritty heart . 
our data suggests that very clearly , there are many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , according to our data rates , usually willpower with other factors , and off , even with the brilliance measures run counter . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard nurture in kids qualities tough most effective called &quot; exponential growth mindset . &quot; 
stanford 卡洛杜 william chris suggested , he had an idea that people &apos;s ability to learn , it can change alongside your level and to change . 
professor 杜威克 means , when kids learn reading and knowledge about brains and its facing challenges , what was happening and growing situation , after they fail more easily keep going , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure . 
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower . 
but we need more . 
i decided to close my comments on this , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is the elephant in the face of work . 
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas , and most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to make their practice . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in again and again . 
in other words , we only have their own to become more productive willpower make our kids to become more productive willpower . 
thank you . 
steve titus : 泽维尔 dimension into that local culture . 
as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , will also think about architecture , with their environment , and with the buildings , around the environment , which is the relationship between tradition . 
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples based on this idea . 
these two examples are emerging in a country , in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
this one , two cases have in common is that design solutions final shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping malls . 
this was my team and i get the same example , we were asked to design this way . 
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do . 
looking at the same kind of style of architecture -- after the city has a lot of this kind of building -- we discovered these buildings , the most important three questions . 
first , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , people are not the big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because the roads are built outside of glass , this design would be trapped inside heat in architecture , it causes we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this city climate is quite 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. . 
the third problem is the building looks like a relationship between africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t . 
for a culture and abundance 底蕴 cities , it &apos;s called people disappointed . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , when i was a local 集贸市场 deeply . mesmerized . every day , hundreds of people gathered also in open-air architectural environments , from 小商贩 hands and buy all want goods . 
this is consistent with my ideas , is in outdoor public setting create campaigns ideas . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the question is , how can we in such a contemporary architecture 多层 贯彻 of these ideas ? 
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , are we designing doesn &apos;t exist . 
and this building back and forth on the streets , two years ago in parallel 几百米 are no little can connected . 
so we need to do is we use all of this very building a portal , put those two road linked it up . 
we then through a gradient of 庭 design , created an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 . 
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little idea marketplace . each layer of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same . 
i think another problem is , how buildings outside walls patterns ? 
and i really wanted to find a design for decoration , to local environment . 
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole , made out of cement to use a controlled by the way , get outside of light and air to go into the building . 
we went from ethiopia women beautiful patterns in traditional dress got inspiration . 
these forms that contains a geometry of texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls . 
we were outside walls &apos;s using these small 预制 material , these windows to let light and air to control our way into the building . 
in order to do this point , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use inside , light source in the entire building up at night . 
these ideas , but we don &apos;t start building touch people , they react to things like , &quot; this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all recognize , this design solutions than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop . 
and this outer wall design , a ton of lowering cost , not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use the air handling so much to control the temperature . 
and eventually , we also save a part of the budget . 
builds stage of the first question is , how do we ensure that building to electricity on the question , because cities are almost every day to pull pushing 闸 electricity . 
so we were on the roof of the solar panels . 
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 used to break , to be here in cities , oasis 小憩 for people . 
on the roof of these 游廊 concentrated , by using to collect rainwater , for building clean inside . 
now we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , beginning as well . 
the second example is a city planners tunisia for over a 2000套 apartment buildings and collateral infrastructure . 
do such a large scale project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i only need was really understand the tunisian city , and she also need to understand all kinds of tradition and culture . 
and in the process of my attention to be a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a structure , over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure , there are 12 , the doors through 相互之间 is almost straight path connected . 
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets , will large areas divide 12 primary small region in size and all the characteristics we kind of in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning . 
in these blocks planning basis , referenced mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , shifted started model . 
the last step is to consider a specific areas in the design of the building , apartment these kind of a cubicle , is that this poses a fundamental planning components . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is the best towards ? 
the answer is , can use to 南北朝 house on either 南北 temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we achieve this pattern , and all the apartments have perfect facing . 
this is our design effect , as an arab town , combined with style , european style residential together . 
some of the building areas with a garden , and walk around on the ground sidewalks to connect intact . 
and she &apos;s satisfying local management agency needs , 上层建筑 population density of the population density and higher than high . 
and she would satisfy us right out even between entry 通性 demand . 
this is the roof of the project i 得意 part , which is like these will be building up space and back to the community . 
the community can climb roof , each type poke somebody talk about god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , jump back and forth between or in architecture . 
these two examples of some common , in the design process took the same way . 
again , they are emerging in cities , you can see the little 拔地而起 intuitive buildings . 
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building at the same speed . 
for this reason , i think about the design of buildings in between , the more important , which , find enough cheap and simple solution , to increase and promote the local people and urban environments relationship , and can make people good close to nature . 
thank you very much . 
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i want to tell you about trust , people said about the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in reality society has become a cliche . 
i think that there are three things . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus . 
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 . 
and the third is task : we should rebuild 信任感 . 
i think people to this proposition , purpose and missions that are wrong . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , mission purpose and a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is proposition : why people believe in 信任感 down ? 
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think that &apos;s really 信任感 down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways maybe is increasing . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls , poll should be thought 信任感 in decline come in . 
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this view . 
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe it &apos;s mostly journalists and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted . 
and 20 years ago is been highly trust people like judges , and the nurse , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in social 居中 on these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
polls records and of course , is that some people view . 
or you can record polls ? 
but that &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;ll say anything . 
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ? 
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot; 
you trust sell fish ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart against asked . 
when you understand that question , what would you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
a very rational answer . 
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways to seek trust . 
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the official administration , etc . , people will be types . 
for example , i would say i certainly believe in an elementary school teacher i know how to teach students reading . but i don &apos;t believe that she can prescribe bus . 
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers . 
i might believe that i love drinking friend &apos;s friends chatting . but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them , he &apos;s a secret to living people . 
it &apos;s that simple . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , say there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 , so why polls , we all want 信任感 糊涂 , put more conceptual ? 
i think poll was a very bad measure 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to consider 信任感 poor judgment . 
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ? 
its purpose is we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think that it was ridiculous . 
this is not i thought that purpose . 
i would say , for people should be trusted to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people . 
in fact , i said it was trying not to trust not trusted people . 
for example , who put themselves to earn that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money to roll out 麦道 夫 sir , i think people who say that , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s too easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
wise to trust and wise trust to choose not to be true purpose . 
so somebody says , well , ok , this is not the most important not to trust , but reliability credibility ? 
that means to determine whether someone in some ways trustworthy . 
i think the need to make decisions about 3 . 
they want to see whether or not ? allows you to do ? honest whether reliable ? 
if we think someone &apos;s allows you to , in his own area is . it allows you to be honest reliable . we have reason to believe they , because they &apos;re reliable . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not they were trying to help me to send messages , because they forget it . 
i got some very confident friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident . 
of course , i &apos;m glad that allows you to my friends were reliable , and not is not very honest . 
perhaps there , i haven &apos;t discovered . 
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation reliability . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions in accountability needs institutions , whether they achieve professional standards or official demand on these making it easier for us to determine whether there &apos;s credibility . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that . 
i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 chat , she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a than 手续 接生 a children &apos;s hard to ! &quot; 
in our lives , our public institutions lives , we found a lot of questions . the institution in accountability for these rules to protect his reputation as can be trusted by institutions have implemented it &apos;s the opposite . 
it allows people to focus their jobs , like they 助产士 , let them take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned . 
you actually had this experience . 
about purpose to talk a lot . 
it &apos;s not easy thing . this is the judgment , is rapidly response , an attitude , here are not talking about it . 
and thirdly , about the task . 
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got a tail . 
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust . 
okay , we can do for ourselves . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but what roots closed , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from others . 
you can &apos;t rebuild them for your ideas . 
you need to make people trying to get you any 家信 . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful , according to let them know that you are trustworthy . 
should do ? 
actually , day in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , often very effective . 
i give you just a simple family business marketing examples . 
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions . 
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me change color is my favorite socks . 
it &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me feel like they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very well be trusted . according to say to yourself , you have confidence . 
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell . 
people are trustworthy and people who is a relationship . we could determine when people &apos;s worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
john 科林 托克斯 : the movies manhood . 
as the father that makes me happy , is able to see themselves loved the movie . 
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
the next few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
and she put themselves dressed like as 仙女 still holding 魔杖 . 
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll find this film is so special . 
now , we live , raising kids , kids are getting immersed in a fantastic complexity of the world . 
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot; 
it &apos;s not like that . 
this trend is 40 years later today &apos;s popular . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 毛绒绒 and a guy to mimic the enemy to safeguard save a girl . 
you think about this is what movie ? ... 
right . 
this film well there are many different , &quot; with &quot; tracking 仙 绿野 recent years we see the film in all aspects 两三 there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients . 
the monkey &apos;s inside of violence , and this apple . 
but i think if we are tracking 仙 绿野 film , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re prophecy save oz in people . 
use your magic slippers to beat bad 巫婆 military . &quot; 
but that &apos;s not like that . 
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; sex and unique enshrined in most image of heroic role , intelligence , even bad are women . 
i was in a few years later , along with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized that point , when that happens there are different . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
and three . 
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him at together . 
but as home for a second child , his care suddenly sort of a lot . 
and he would run into in , and then the mystery is like a little duck were seen as duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , but he clearly i became obsessed with this . 
i &apos;m curious he liked this film reasons . 
a subject that film out of courage , tenacity and faithful ? 
and also 卢克 joins the army facts about overthrowing a government ? 
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
dorothy is how to win ? 
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders . 
i hope to their children in this environment -- oz world -- up , and not to beat up to the world , the world -- this was a very very close to reality . 
why do we show kids movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ? 
about men &apos;s violence against women on film , there are many brilliant article analysis , you should go . good writing . 
a lot to affect boy , i read the article , not so much . 
and my own experience for me , the princess 从莱娅 surrounds environment guide me not getting experience in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; men and women of 混居 . &quot; 
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the movie , it has to be 演员表 emergence , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
i finished mission , winning 芳 heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t know what to do . 
these films focus on the beat the bad guys get rewarded , not so much time dealing with other relationships and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you ought to be wearing 战袍 . 
of course , as an example of , and i &apos;ll in front of you for disney princess were defense . 
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not expect these films audience . 
these films had a big all because that &apos;s how we teach girls rebel 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society . 
kids don &apos;t idol can 寻 . 
we also have some amazing women start for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i tell you all recommend this film . now are being shown in . 
you remember the brave legends criticism , &quot; just project ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe it 皮克斯 started doing princess movies . &quot; 
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , these films almost nothing , &quot; by 贝克德 test . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
this test for not known , but today , maybe we can do about them . 
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , and she remembers recorded her and a friend in assessment they saw the movie about content . 
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
consider the standard . 
if you are , female characters in movies are talking about ? 
if there &apos;s no conversation , with their common 心上人 talk about content ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
women have to speak , two , a conversation . 
there was this film . i saw , but we &apos;ve seen in and enjoy movies is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a good quality movie 阿尔戈 . &quot; 
oscar the film , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i think it should not movies . because most plot don &apos;t know you &apos;ve seen , no movies plot of what &apos;s happening in the event has been hijacked 人质 big 使馆 period , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see several scene , the men in place to be profound and full of anxiety conversation . and one girl movie actor , the nice story is the next door said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot; 
this is the hollywood . 
look at statistics . 
the most popular front 2011 100部 movies , how many film has heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
just universal picked congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , this is a good ratio . 
and the percentage of just higher and the percentage of you will get shock . 
last year , new york times published a paper done by government . 
here &apos;s the content . 
in the united states every five women who &apos;s ever met 性骚扰 . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s popular entertainment had wrong . 
i don &apos;t think this is due to film children . 
i even think porn music and movie with this direct doesn &apos;t matter , but certainly where wrong . when i hear the statistics , i was thinking about 性骚扰 , population is so much . 
who were they ? how they were teaching them ? 
they learned leaks ? 
they had no understanding of a movie plot men , a hero beat 残暴 反派 and get the glory and reward -- is not a friend and not speak woman ? 
we have no story to extract from them in ? 
you know , as a father and daughter raising obligation , let me tell you all the parents , people were in the world and statistics that exist 危机感 , we &apos;re going to prevent them right . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be a very important way , i was mainly about my father said . 
i think we should for our boys showing a new manhood . 
now manhood already definition of putting the cart before the horse . 
you already know new economic environmental changing women his family home men 胡口 role . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters , you know , she said , who ? 
wangari than 欧 ... 
than 欧 -- wangari steve , sensing than the and 葛琳 
what they have in common ? 
perhaps like beautiful dress , no matter . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their own movies than others have more knowledge , and willing to share their knowledge with others to help others digging potential . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i want my daughter has this pursuit , but also hope your son has this pursuit . 
i hope that the pursuit of more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment and terrorism connection between 
i want to tell you a story about a little kid . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i knew his story . 
he lived in somalia in a small village 
it &apos;s very 加迪休 village from the capital . 
this little village , because it &apos;s been so drought 食不果腹 poor people . 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the somali capital &apos;s 加迪休 , is the largest cities . 
he just arrived , no , no , no prospects opportunities . 
and only lived in a tent that &apos;s 加迪休 town in the country . 
and last year , and there &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch . 
he discovered a bunch of people have vitality and he &apos;s got rest . 
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes can give their own native to send money . 
somebody gives he introduced a young girl . 
and they did . 
he started new life . 
he lives have goals . 
&apos;s 加迪休 in one day in the sky 碧蓝 happened a car bombing . 
this cities with dreams town boy is the suicide bombers , and it did help dynamic people are &quot; for youth &quot; party , an al qaeda connected with a terrorist organization . 
this little boy just wanted to go through the city why through his story was a suicide attack for the end ? 
he actually wait . 
he was an opportunity for waiting his turn on a waiting for the future can move road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road . 
this is going to be like him waiting 成年期 from the first encounter . 
and he &apos;s stories are repeated in the world with different downtown . 
this is a story about being taken power , urban youth unemployment story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots , they started to get 成年期 outside . 
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means job opportunities , wealth , but people didn &apos;t enjoy where they live in cities . 
more , are in youth unemployment stand on top . 
by 2030 , five people living in cities , which has three under 18 belong to the crowd . 
if we in urban development , not to young people think , of course , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and the gang 雷池 will be the future of cities . 
i was born in cities , more 加迪休 70 percent of people in unemployment . 
70 percent no job , no reading books . 
basically do nothing 
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital home that i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing that are full of play eye hospital in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it be ? 
if i have to get at the same waiting 成年期 ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
so i did say no answers . 
i came last month &apos;s 加迪休 reason is actually to try an obsession with business leadership learn summit 
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership 
we sat down to working together to solve the problem facing the largest cities . 
one in the room called aden young people . 
he &apos;s 加迪休 at the university and graduated . 
there was no job nothing . 
i remember i told him because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , &quot; it was very frustrated youth party &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want recruiting people . 
those people that look like this . 
but his story , there &apos;s another version 
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and the biggest obstacle was roads 
23 years of civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , it actually became the easy-to-use tools . 
aden found opportunities and grab on it . 
he drove a motorcycle company . 
started cab motorcycle rent for local people who buy motorcycle 
in 亲朋好友 help , he bought 10辆 he eventually dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆 
he &apos;s story about how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i believe is his and find opportunities to grasp opportunity ability . 
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is waiting 成年期 with the most effective tool . 
he drove young people become they kept 60-minute searching for economic opportunity makers 
you can train young them into entrepreneurs . 
i want to tell you about a man who had to me that i have a meeting he called doctor-heroes mohamoud is a 名花 businesses . 
he helped me during training in business summit part of the young people how to grow them how to create a cultural entrepreneurial innovation . 
if you ask people , &quot; you see the flowers , what is it ? &quot; born in civil wars period for many people they answer would be , &quot; never seen before . &quot; 
so , from found opportunities in doctor-heroes 
he created an 园林 greening and design and the company . 
he &apos;s 加迪休 go out on a piece of agriculture , and he started planting tulip 百合花 and he said that can have a flower &apos;s hostile 加迪休 climate . 
and he started to build 家庭式 wedding send the flower garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s busy trying to build 加迪休 22年 for the first park citizens . 
in today &apos;s 加迪休 is no park citizens . 
he wanted to create a space for family , young people together to be here as he said , to feel rose 花香 and enlightenment . 
by the way down , he can &apos;t grow rose and the reason is because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire the young so in that room , the doctor-heroes attend to this very deeply affected young people . 
they don &apos;t want to be entrepreneurial . 
they thought for civil society organizations work for government work , but in this case , he innovation for those people very big impact . 
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city . 
he makes them believe they can also be entrepreneurs can be changing the world . 
and the day before , they came up with novel solutions to solve this cities now some of the most intractable problems . 
they came up with a business solution to local problems . 
so inspired to create young corporate culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas . 
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business . 
they provide for young people need for resources they need to provide support and helping them from idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for urban development . 
for me , entrepreneurship is not only commercial pressing 
it involves creating social impact . 
not sells flowers on doctor-heroes 
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling . 
his name is peace park , he took when it , it will create a truly change people in this city . 
side street aden hire him for a cab also help strengthen the motorcycle 
he gave them the opportunity to escape from waiting to escape from 成年期 unfortunate . 
these young entrepreneurs for all of them have a profound impact cities . 
so my suggestion is that move more young people become entrepreneurs inward development nurturing their creative spirit that will have more flowers and peace park story begins , rather than the car bomb and wait 成年期 story . 
thank you . 
薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read the chinese word for ! 
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , my most precious memory is one of my mom for shows the chinese word for the beauty of form of care . 
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language . 
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to china as 高不可攀 wall . 
the last few years , i kept thinking about how we can tackle this wall , for those who want to understand and enjoy it complicated language elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new and fast , to help the chinese word for learning . 
from five up , i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book . 
fifteen years time , i &apos;m learning new the chinese word for every day . 
because we are only five minutes , preferably something more time with a simple faster way of learning . 
a chinese scholar , the chinese word for 二万个 recognize . 
you just need to recognize the chinese word for a thousand , can read simple literature . 
that top 二百个 , the chinese word for you to understand the basic 40 literature -- enough to read and sign to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
today i use the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
put your mouth is getting bigger , the better , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words . 
this is a man was walking . 
&quot; one &quot; words . 
this is a tree . 
&quot; carpenter . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; signs like wild about comfort pair of cars on the door . 
i call this eight words for basic words . 
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
&quot; a man . &quot; 
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
a phrase , two , three people from artifacts for public . 
if somebody open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; the world , people were stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about getting stuck in the whale belly . 
tree . &quot; is &quot; carpenter &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot; 
three trees together , is &quot; forests . &quot; 
take a piece of wood on trees , and we have &quot; basic . &quot; 
take a 张嘴 under a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot; 
remember to very easy , because a will speak trees are very 呆傻 things . 
remember &quot; fire ? &quot; 
&quot; 两团 fire &quot; together , it becomes very &quot; hot . &quot; 
&quot; 三团 fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much . 
to put the fire &apos;s two trees , will &quot; burn &quot; . 
for us , everything from the sun &apos;s life . 
two together , the sun is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around . 
the sun three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot; 
when the sun shines together and the moon , which is &quot; light . &quot; 
one day after a night was , &quot; tomorrow . &quot; 
from the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; &quot; 旦 . 
&quot; a door . &quot; in the door put in a piece of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot; 
take a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot; 
&quot; bang &quot; -- boom , someone at home ? 
this man was even outside , &quot; &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; escape . 
the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , maybe have debate . 
three women together , be careful , is &quot; and &quot; 姦 . 
we &apos;ve learned about the chinese word for 30 . 
and through this way , this basic eight words can secondary up into 32 the chinese word for . 
the next eight of the chinese word for it will secondary out the chinese word for another 32 . 
so , you can really easy to learn , that the chinese word for hundreds of equivalent of china was eight children of chinese language . 
learning over those words later , we started learning how to build a phrase . 
like , &quot; the mountain . &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcano . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot; 
we know that japan is the sun rises place . 
and here the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china . 
so the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot; 
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; man , we get ? 
&quot; the japanese . &quot; 
the words are stacking up and down the mountain , those two together . 
in the ancient chinese , which means 流亡 , because chinese clothes 政敌 to put in the mountain . 
nowadays , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go away . &quot; 
&quot; and &quot; a word tell you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot; 
this slide reminds me , to finish up , and walking down the table . thank you .
