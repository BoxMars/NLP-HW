jay meg : why is not the new 20 to 30 
when i was in my 20s s , i saw my very first client psychotherapy . 
i was a ph . d. student in clinical psychology at berkeley . 
she was a -- -- 26 year old woman named alex . 
now alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems . 
now when i heard this , i was so relieved . 
my classmate got an arsonist for her first client . 
and i got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about who . 
i thought i could handle this . 
but i didn't handle it . 
with the funny stories that alex would bring to session , it was easy for me to my head just nod while we kicked the can down the road . 
&quot; the thirty's new 20th , &quot; alex would say , and as far as i could tell , she was right . 
work happened marriage happened later , later , kids happened later , evan death happened later . 
twentysomethings like alex and i had nothing but time . 
but before long , my supervisor pushed me to push alex about love her life . 
i pushed back . 
i said , &quot; sure , she's dating down , she's sleeping with a knucklehead , but not like she's &apos;s going to marry the guy . &quot; 
and then my supervisor said , &quot; not yet , but she might marry the next one . 
besides , the best time to work on alex's marriage is before she has one . &quot; 
that's what psychologists call an &quot; aha ! &quot; moment . 
that was the moment i realized , 30 is not the new 20. 
yes , people settle down later than they used to , but that didn't make 20 alex's s a developmental downtime . 
that made 20 alex's s a developmental sweet spot watch , and we were sitting there blowing it . 
that was when i realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real call , and it had real consequences , not just for alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere . 
there are 50 million twentysomethings in the united states right now . 
we're talking about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you consider that no one's adulthood without getting through their s going through the first . 
raise your hand if you're in your 20 s. 
i really want to see some twentysomethings here . 
oh , yay ! y'all's awesome . 
if you work with twentysomethings , you love a twentysomething , you're losing sleep twentysomethings over , i want to see -- okay . awesome , twentysomethings really matter . 
this is not my opinion . these are the facts . 
we know it that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35. 
that means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and &quot; aha ! &quot; moments that make your life is what it will have happened by your mid -- 30 s. 
people who are over 40 , don't panic . 
this crowd is going to be fine , i think . 
we know it that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn . 
we know it that more than half of americans are married or are living with or dating partner 30. by their future 
we know it that the brain caps off its last second growth + spurt in your s as 20 or rewires itself for adulthood , which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself , now is the time to change it . 
we know it that changes your personality during the 20 more than at any other time in life , and we know it that female fertility peaks at age 28 , and things get tricky after age 35. 
so 20 your s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options . 
so when we think about child development , we all know it that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain . 
&apos;s a time when your ordinary , day to day -- -- inordinate life has an impact on who you will become . 
but what we hear about is that less there's such a thing as adult development , and our 20 s that are critical period of adult development . 
but what this isn't twentysomethings are hearing . 
newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood . 
20 researchers call the s an extended adolescence . 
journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like &quot; twixters &quot; and &quot; kidults . &quot; 
&apos;s true . 
as a culture , we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood . 
leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time . 
isn't that true ? 
so what do you think happens when a twentysomething you pat on the head and you say , &quot; have you 10 extra years to start your life ? &quot; 
nothing happens . 
you have robbed that person of his urgency + ambition , + absolutely nothing happens . 
or they say , &quot; everybody says as long as i get started on a career by the time , 30 i'm i'll be fine . &quot; 
but then it starts to sound like this : &quot; s are almost 20 my over , and i have nothing to show for myself . 
i had a better r é sum é the day after i graduated from college . &quot; 
and then it starts to sound like this : &quot; dating in my 20s s was like musical chairs . 
everybody was running around and having fun , but then sometime around 30 it was like the music started turned off and everybody sitting down . 
i want to be the only didn't one left standing up , so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30. . &quot; 
where are the twentysomethings here ? 
do not do that . 
okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high . 
when a lot has been pushed to your 30 s , there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump -- start a career , pick a city , partner up , and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time . 
many of these things are incompatible , and as research is just starting to show , simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30 s. 
the post -- millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car . 
realizing you have can't &apos;s career now that you want . 
you have can't &apos;s realizing that child now you want , or you can't give your child a sibling . 
too many thirtysomethings + fortysomethings look at themselves , and at me , sitting across the room , and say about 20 their s , &quot; what was i doing ? what was i thinking ? &quot; 
i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking . 
here's a story about how that can go . 
&apos;s a story about a woman named emma . 
at 25,000 emma came to my office because she was , in her words , having an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment , but she decided hadn't yet , so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead . 
because it was cheaper , she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition . 
and as hard as 20 her s , were her early life had been evan harder . 
she cried often in our sessions , but then would collect herself by saying , &quot; you can't pick your family , but you can pick your friends . &quot; 
well , one day emma comes in and she hangs her head in her us , and she sobbed for most of the hour . 
she'd just bought a new address book , and spent she'd filling in the morning , but then her contacts many she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words &quot; in case of emergency , please ... call . &quot; 
she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said , &quot; who's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck ? 
who's going to take care of me if i have cancer ? &quot; 
now in that moment , it took everything i had not to say , &quot; i will . &quot; 
but what emma needed some wasn't therapist who really , really cared . 
emma needed a better life , and i knew this was her chance . 
i had learned too much since i first worked with alex to just sit there while emma's defining decade parading went by . 
so over the next weeks and months , i told emma three things that every male and female , twentysomething or deserves to hear . 
first , i told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital . 
by get identity capital , i mean do something that adds to value who you are . 
do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next . 
i know it didn't the future of emma's career , and no one knows the future of work , but i do know it : this identity capital begets identity capital . 
so now is the time for that job , that cross -- country internship startup , that you want to try . 
not i'm discounting twentysomething exploration here , but i am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration . 
that's procrastination . 
i told emma to explore and make it work count . 
second , i told emma that the urban tribe is overrated . 
best friends are great for giving rides to the airport , but who twentysomethings huddle together with -- like minded limit peers who they know it , what they know it , how they think , how they speak , and where they work . 
that new piece of capital , that the person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle . 
new things come from what are called our weak ties , our friends of friends of friends . 
so yes , half of twentysomethings are un -- or under -- employed . 
but half aren't ties are weak , and how you get yourself into that group . 
half of new jobs are never posted , so reaching out to your boss neighbor's is how you get that -- un posted job . 
&apos;s not cheating . &apos;s the science of how information spreads . 
last but not least , emma can't believed that you pick your family , but you can pick your friends . 
now this was true for for her up , but as a twentysomething , soon emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own . 
i told the emma time to start picking your family is now . 
now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down , evan than 20 or 25 , and i agree with you . 
but whoever grabbing you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress . 
the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one , and that means being with love as intentional as you are with work . 
picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you . 
so what happened to emma ? 
well , we went through that address book , and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state . 
weak tie that helped her get a job there . 
her job offer that it &apos;s the reason to leave that global live -- in boyfriend . 
now , five years later , a special she's events planner for museums . 
she's married to a man mindfully she chose . 
she loves her new career , she loves her new family , and she sent me a card that said , &quot; now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough . &quot; 
now emma's story made that sound that's easy , but what i love about working with twentysomethings . 
they are so easy to help . 
twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving for somewhere , lax bound west . 
right after takeoff , a slight change in course is the difference between landing in alaska or fiji . 
likewise , at 21 or 25 or evan 29 , one good conversation , break one good , good ted talk , one can have an enormous effect years and evan across generations to come . 
so here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know it . 
&apos;s as simple as what i learned to say to alex . 
&apos;s what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma every single day : thirty is not the new 20 , so claim your adulthood , get some identity capital , use your weak ties , pick your family . 
don't be defined by what didn't didn't or do you know it . 
your life you're deciding right now . 
thank you . 
jinha lee : reach into the computer and grab a pixel 
throughout the history of computers we &apos;ve been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild . 
and this gap has become shorter , shorter , and evan shorter , and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter , the thickness of a touch screen -- the glass , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone . 
but i wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ? 
i started to imagine what this would look like . 
first , i created this tool which penetrates the digital into space , so when you press it hard on the screen , or transfers its physical body into pixels . 
designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3d , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen . 
so with this tool -- this boundary has been broken . 
but our two hands still remain outside the screen . 
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full of dexterity our hands ? 
at microsoft applied sciences , along with my mentor cati boulanger , i redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace . 
by combining a transparent and display depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face , now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3d space and grab pixels with your bare hands . 
because files windows and have a position in the real selecting them , space is as easy as a grabbing book off your shelf . 
then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines , words on the virtual touch tool the tedpad . below each floating windows . 
architects can stretch or rotate the models with their hands two directly . 
so in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world . 
but how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ? 
i'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online . 
but now don't you have to worry about it . 
what i got here is an online augmented fitting room . 
this is a view that you get from head -- mounted or see through display -- when the system understands the geometry of your body . 
taking this idea further , i started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ? 
what would such a future look like ? 
the media lab because at mit , along with my advisor hiroshi ishii and my collaborator rehmi post , we created this one physical pixel . 
well , in this case , this spherical magnet acts like a 3d pixel in our space , which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3d space . 
what we did was essentially canceling &apos;s gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation + mechanical actuation + sensing technologies . 
and by the programming digitally object , we are liberating object from the constraints of time and space , which means that now , human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world . 
so choreography can be taught physically over distance and michael jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality . 
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex motion as such planetary concepts , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and &apos;s very powerful . 
and what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the physical computer programming is to start imagining how the world will alter our physical evan daily activities . 
as you can see , the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world . 
today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination . 
thank you . 
lisa bu : how books can open your mind 
so i was trained to become a gymnast for two years in hunan , china in the 1970 s. 
when i was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid . 
but tiger my mother said , &quot; no . &quot; 
my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them . 
after surviving the cultural revolution , they believed firmly there's only one sure way to happiness : a safe and -- well paid job . 
it is not important if i like the job or not . 
but my dream was to become a chinese opera singer . 
that is me playing my imaginary piano . 
an opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so i tried everything i could opera to go to school . 
evan , i wrote to the school principal and the host of a line at radio show . 
but no adults liked the idea . 
no adults believed i was serious . 
my only friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as i was . 
so at age 15 , i knew i was too old to be trained . 
my dream would never come true . 
i was afraid that for the rest of my life -- some second class happiness would be the best i could hope for . 
but so that's unfair . 
so i was determined to find another calling . 
nobody around to teach me ? fine . 
i turned to books . 
&#91; &quot; complete works of sanmao &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; lessons from &quot; history by nan huaijin &#93; i came to the u . s. in 1995 , which so did i first read books here ? 
books banned in china , of course . 
&quot; the good earth &quot; is about peasant chinese life . 
not just that's convenient for propaganda . got it . 
the bible is interesting , but strange . 
that's a different topic for a day . 
but it &apos;s the fifth commandment me an epiphany : &quot; you shall honor your father and mother . &quot; 
&quot; honor , &quot; i said , &quot; that's so different , and , better than obey . &quot; 
so it becomes my tool to climb out of this guilt confucian trap + to restart my relationship with my parents . 
encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading . 
it offers many insights . 
for example , i found this map out of place at first because this is what chinese students grew up with . 
it had never occurred to me , china doesn't have to be at the center of the world . 
a map actually carries somebody's view . 
comparative reading is actually nothing new . 
&apos;s a standard practice in the academic world . 
there are evan research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature . 
compare and contrast scholars gives a more complete understanding of a topic . 
so i thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ? 
so i started reading books in pairs . 
so they can be about people -- &#91; &quot; benjamin franklin &quot; by walter isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; john adams &quot; by david mccullough &#93; -- who are involved in the same event , or shared experiences with friends . 
for the christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual . 
for the buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty -- interesting . 
so if you know it &apos;s also a foreign language , fun to read your favorite books in two languages . 
&#91; &quot; the way of chuang tzu &quot; thomas merton &#93; &#91; &quot; tao : the watercourse way &quot; alan watts &#93; instead of lost in translation , i found there is much to gain . 
for example , that &apos;s through translation , i realized &quot; happiness &quot; in chinese literally means &quot; huh ! &quot; joy fast . 
&quot; bride , &quot; in chinese literally means &quot; new mother . &quot; uh -- oh . 
books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present . 
i know it , i shall never lonely or feel powerless again . 
having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered . 
i have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream . 
most important its purpose is to get in touch with us where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from . 
evan a shattered dream can do that for you . 
so because of books , i'm here today , again , happy living with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time . 
so may books always be with you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
parul sehgal : an ode to envy 
so when i was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be . 
she had vast quantities of shiny hair and a very cute little pencil case , super strong on state capitals , just a great speller . 
and i just curdled with jealousy that year , until i plan my hatched devious . 
so one day i stayed late after a little school , a little too late , and i girls' lurked in the bathroom . 
when the coast , i was clear , emerged crept into the classroom , and took from my desk teacher's the grade book . 
and then i did it . 
i fiddled with my rival's grades , just a little demoted , just some of those a &apos;s . 
all of those a &apos;s . 
and i got the ready to return to the book , drawer when hang on , some of my classmates appallingly other had good grades too . 
so , in a frenzy , i corrected everybody's marks , not imaginatively . 
everybody : it &apos;s a row of d's + myself : it &apos;s a row of a &apos;s , just because i was there , you know it , might as well . 
and i am still baffled by my behavior . 
i understand don't where the idea came from . 
i don't understand why i felt so great doing it . 
i felt great . 
i don't understand why i was never caught . 
i mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious . 
i was never caught . 
but most of all , i am baffled by , why did it bother me so much that this little girl , this tiny , little girl was so good at spelling ? 
jealousy baffles me . 
so , that &apos;s mysterious + &apos;s so pervasive . 
we know it babies suffer from jealousy . 
we know it primates . do bluebirds are actually very prone . 
we know it that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states . 
and yet , i have never read a study that can its loneliness to parse me or its longevity or its grim thrill . 
for that , we have to go to fiction , because the novel is the ; that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration . 
in fact , if i don't know it &apos;s an exaggeration to say that if we have didn't jealousy , would we have eg literature ? 
well no faithless helen , &quot; no odyssey . &quot; 
no , no &quot; king jealous arabian nights . &quot; 
no shakespeare . 
there goes high school reading lists , because we're losing &quot; sound and the fury , &quot; &quot; losing we're gatsby , &quot; &quot; also sun rises , &quot; we're losing &quot; madame bovary , &quot; &quot; anna king . &quot; 
no , no proust jealousy . and now , i mean , i know it &apos;s fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything , but in the case of jealousy , he kind of does . 
this year is the centennial of his masterpiece , &quot; in search of lost time , &quot; + &apos;s the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness , my brand , that we can hope to have . 
and we think about proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ? 
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep . 
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea . 
we forget how harsh his vision was . 
we forget how pitiless he is . 
i mean , these are books that virginia woolf said were tough as cat gut . 
i know it don't what cat gut is , but let's assume &apos;s formidable . 
look at let's why they go so well together , the novel + jealousy , jealousy + proust . 
is it something as obvious that as jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ? 
i know it don't . i think it cuts very close to the bone , because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous . 
when we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story . 
we tell ourselves a story about other people's lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible . 
as the teller of the tale and the audience , we know it just what details to include , to dig in that knife . right ? 
jealousy makes us all amateur novelists , and this is something proust understood . 
everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure , maybe right about now . &quot; 
and this is the story he starts to tell himself , and from then on , proust writes that every fresh charm swann detects in his mistress , he adds to &quot; his collection of instruments in his private torture chamber . &quot; 
now swann + proust , we have to admit , were notoriously jealous . 
you know it , proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him . 
but you have to be that don't jealous to concede that &apos;s hard work . right ? 
jealousy is exhausting . 
it &apos;s a hungry . emotion must be fed . 
and what does jealousy like ? 
jealousy likes information . 
jealousy likes details . 
jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case . 
jealousy likes photos . 
why that's instagram is such a hit . 
proust actually links the language of scholarship + jealousy . 
when swann is in his jealous throes , and suddenly he's listening at bribing doorways and his mistress' servants , he defends these behaviors . 
he says , &quot; you know it , look , you know it , i think this is repugnant , but it is no different from an ancient interpreting text or looking at a monument . &quot; 
he says , &quot; they are scientific investigations with real intellectual value . &quot; 
grief , loss : humiliation , these were the avenues to proust for wisdom . 
he says , &quot; whom we need a woman , makes us who suffer from us , elicits a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . &quot; 
he is telling us to just go and find cruel women ? 
no . i think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals to us ourselves . 
and does any other emotion crack open us in this particular way ? 
does any other emotion to reveal us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ? 
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ? 
freud would write about this later . 
one day , freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him . 
and freud , says something &apos;s strange about this guy , because he's not looking at what his wife is doing . 
because she's blameless ; everybody knows it . 
the poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause . 
but he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing , unintentional behaviors . 
is she too smiling brightly here , or did she accidentally brush up against a man there ? 
&#91; the &#93; freud says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious . 
the novel is very good on this point . 
the novel is very good at how describing jealousy trains with us to look intensity but not accuracy . 
in fact , the more we are intensely jealous , the more we become residents of fantasy . 
and this is why , i think , jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do things or violent illegal things . 
jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive . 
now i'm thinking of myself at eight , i , but i'm concede also thinking of this story i heard on the news . 
a 52 -- -- year old woman michigan was caught creating a fake facebook account from which she sent vile , hideous messages to herself for a year . 
for a year , a year . 
and she was trying to frame her -- ex boyfriend's new girlfriend , and i have to confess when i heard this , i just reacted with admiration . 
because , i mean , let's be real . 
what if , creativity , immense misplaced . right ? 
this is something from a novel . 
this is something from a patricia highsmith novel . 
now highsmith is a particular favorite of mine . 
she is the very bizarre and brilliant woman of american letters . 
take tom ripley , her most famous character . 
now , tom ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you had once , and you're under the floorboards , he's answering to your name , he's wearing your rings , emptying your bank account . 
that's one way to go . 
but what do we do ? we can't go the tom ripley route . 
i give the can't world d's , as much as i would really like to , some days . 
and &apos;s a pity , because we in global live envious times . 
we in global live jealous times . 
i mean , we're all good citizens of the media and social aren't we , where the currency is envy ? 
does the novel show us a way out ? i'm not sure . 
so what do let's characters always do when they're not sure , when they are in possession of a mystery . 
b 221 let's go to baker street and ask for sherlock holmes . 
when people think of holmes , they think of his nemesis being michael moriarty professor , right , this criminal mastermind . 
but always i've preferred &#91; the &#93; inspector lestrade , who is the rat -- faced head of scotland yard who needs holmes , desperately needs holmes' genius , but resents him . 
oh , that &apos;s so familiar to me . 
so his lestrade needs help , resents him , and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries . 
we're proud of you . &quot; 
and he says that there's not a man at scotland yard wouldn't who want to shake sherlock holmes' hand . 
&apos;s one of the few times we see holmes moved in the mysteries , and i find it very moving , this little scene , but also &apos;s mysterious , right ? 
it seems to treat jealousy as a call of geometry , not emotion . 
you know it , one minute holmes is on the other side from lestrade . 
the next minute they're on the same side . 
suddenly , lestrade is letting himself admire he's resented this mind that . 
it could be so simple though ? 
what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ? 
well , maybe then we have to wouldn't resent somebody's excellence . 
we could align ourselves with it . 
but i like contingency plans . 
so while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for consolation . 
fiction alone demystifies jealousy . 
it invites domesticates fiction alone , it to the table . 
and it gathers : look who sweet , lestrade terrifying tom ripley , crazy , marcel proust swann himself . 
we are in excellent company . 
thank you . 
robin nagle : what i discovered in new york city trash 
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state . 
it was a beautiful day . 
the forest was sparkling . 
the sun made the leaves glow like stained glass , and if it weren't for the path we were following , we could almost we pretend were the first human beings to ever walk that land . 
we got to our campsite . 
it was a -- to lean on a bluff looking over a crystal , beautiful lake , when i discovered a horror . 
behind the lean -- to was a dump , maybe 40 square feet with rotting apple cores and balled aluminum foil -- up , and a dead sneaker . 
and i was astonished , i was very angry , and i was deeply confused . 
the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in , who did they think would clean up after them ? 
stayed with me that question , and it a little simplified . 
who cleans up after us ? 
however you configure or wherever you place the us , who cleans up after us in istanbul ? 
who cleans up after us in rio or in paris or in london ? 
here in new york , the department of sanitation cleans up after us , to the tune of 11 , 7,000 tons of garbage + 2 10,000 tons of recyclables every day . 
i wanted to get to know it them as individuals . 
i wanted to understand who takes the job . 
what's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ? 
so i started a research project with them . 
i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still an outsider . 
i needed to go deeper . 
so i took the job as a sanitation worker . 
i just didn't ride in the trucks . now , i drove the trucks . 
and i operated the mechanical brooms + i. plowed the snow . 
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education . 
everyone asks about the smell . 
but there &apos;s , that &apos;s not as prevalent as you think , and on days when it is really bad , you get used to it rather quickly . 
the weight takes a long time to get used to . 
i knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week . 
then the there's danger . 
according to the bureau of labor statistics , sanitation work is one of the most dangerous 10 occupations in the country , and i learned why . 
you're in and out of traffic all day , and &apos;s zooming around you . 
it just wants to get past you , that &apos;s so often the motorist is not paying attention . 
that's really bad for the worker . 
and then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm . 
i also learned about the relentlessness of trash . 
when you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck , you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself . 
it never stops coming . 
&apos;s also like a form of respiration or circulation . 
it must always be in motion . 
and then there's the stigma . 
i find the stigma especially ironic , because i believe strongly that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city , for three reasons . 
they are the first use guardians of health . 
if not taking away they're effectively and efficiently trash every day , it starts to spill out of its containments , and the dangers inherent i.t. threaten to us in very real ways . 
we &apos;ve had in diseases check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us . 
the economy needs them . 
if we can't throw out the old stuff , we have no room for the new stuff , so then the engines of the economy to start sputter when consumption is compromised . 
i'm not advocating capitalism , i'm just pointing out their relationship . 
and then there's what i call our quotidian velocity , average necessary . 
i mean by that simply how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age . 
we usually don't care for , repair , clean , carry around our coffee cup , our shopping bag , our bottle of water . 
we use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know it a there's workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away . 
so i want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about perhaps sanitation that will help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane . 
their work , i think , is kind of liturgical . 
they're on the streets every day , rhythmically . 
they wear a uniform in many cities . 
you know it when to expect them . 
and their work lets us do our work . 
they are almost a form of reassurance . 
they maintain the flow that keeps us safe , from ourselves from our own dross , our -- cast offs , and that flow must always be maintained no matter what . 
on the day after september 11th in 2001 , i heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street , and i grabbed my son and infant , i ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper route recycling like he did every wednesday . 
and i tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days , but i started to cry . 
and he looked at me , and he just nodded , and he said , &quot; we're going to be okay . 
we're going to be okay . &quot; 
it was a little while later that i started my research with sanitation , and i met that man again . 
his name is paulie , and we worked together many times , and we became good friends . 
i want to believe that paulie was right . 
we are going to be okay . 
but in our effort to how we reconfigure as a species exist on this planet , we must include and take account of all the costs , including the very real human cost of the labor . 
municipal waste , what we think of when we talk about , garbage accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream . 
&apos;s a remarkable statistic . 
so in the flow of your days , in the flow of your lives , next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after , you take a moment to acknowledge them . 
take a moment to say thank you . 
joshua foer : feats of memory anyone can do 
i'd like to invite you to close your eyes . 
imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your running . 
i'd like you to notice the color of the door , the material that &apos;s made out of . 
now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles . 
they are competing in a naked bicycle race , and they are headed straight for your front door . 
i need you to actually see this . 
they are really hard , pedaling they're , sweaty they're bouncing around a lot . 
and they crash straight into the front door of your running . 
bicycles fly everywhere , roll past spokes wheels , you end up in places awkward . 
step over the threshold of your door into your foyer , your hallway , whatever's on the other side , and appreciate the quality of the light . 
the light is shining down on cookie monster . 
cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan le horse . 
&apos;s talking a horse . 
you can feel practically his blue fur tickling your nose . 
you can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth . 
walk past . him walk past him into your living room . 
in your living room , in full imaginative broadband , britney spears picture . 
she is scantily clad , she's dancing on your coffee table , and she's singing &quot; baby hit me one more time . &quot; 
and then follow me into your kitchen . 
okay . open your eyes . 
i want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in new york city . 
&apos;s called the united states championship memory . 
and i had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist expecting , i guess , that this was going to be like the superbowl of savants . 
this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies , widely varying in both age + upkeep hygienic . 
they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once . 
they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers . 
they were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes . 
they were competing to see who could memorize the order of a pack of shuffled playing cards the fastest . 
i was like , this is unbelievable . 
these people must be freaks of nature . 
and i started talking to a few of the competitors . 
this is a guy called ed cook who had come over from england where he had one of the best trained memories . 
and i said to him , &quot; ed , when did you realize that you were a savant ? &quot; 
ed + was like , &quot; i'm not a savant . 
in fact , i just have an average memory . 
everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory . 
and i was like , &quot; whoa . how come i never heard of this before ? &quot; 
and we were standing outside the hall competition , and ed , who is a wonderful , brilliant guy , but somewhat eccentric english , says to me , &quot; an american , josh you're journalist . 
do you know it britney spears ? &quot; 
i'm like , &quot; what ? no . why ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really want to teach britney spears how to memorize the order of a pack of shuffled playing cards on u . s. national television . 
it will prove to the world that anybody can do this . &quot; 
i was like , &quot; well i'm not britney spears , but maybe you could teach me . 
i mean , you've got to start somewhere , right ? &quot; 
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me . 
i ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory , but it also investigating , trying to understand how it works , why it sometimes doesn't work and its potential what might be . 
i met a host of really interesting people . 
this is a guy called e. p . 
an he's amnesic who had , very , very possibly the worst memory in the world . 
his memory was so bad that he didn't evan remember he had a call memory , which is amazing . 
and he was this incredibly tragic figure , but he was a windows into the extent to which our memories make us who we are . 
the other end of the spectrum : i met this guy . 
this is kim peek . 
he was the basis for dustin hoffman's character in the movie &quot; rain man . &quot; 
we spent an afternoon together in the salt lake city library memorizing use phone books , which was scintillating . 
and i went back and i read a whole host of memory , treatises treatises written two plus -- 10,000 years ago in latin in antiquity and then later in the middle ages . 
and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff . 
one of the really interesting things that i learned is that once upon a time , this idea of having a trained , disciplined cultivated memory , so alien was not nearly as it would seem to us to be today . 
once upon a time , people invested in their memories , in laboriously furnishing their minds . 
these technologies have made our modern world possible , but also they've changed us . 
they've changed us culturally , and i would argue that they've cognitively changed us . 
having little need to remember anymore , it seems like sometimes we &apos;ve forgotten how . 
one of the last places on earth where you find people still passionate about this idea of a trained , memory , disciplined cultivated is at this totally singular memory contest . 
that &apos;s actually not singular , there are contests held all over the world . 
and i was fascinated , i wanted to know it , how do these guys do it . 
a few years back a group of researchers at university college london brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab because . 
they wanted to know it : do these guys have brains that are somehow , structurally anatomically different from the rest of ours ? 
the answer was no . 
they are smarter than the rest of us ? 
it &apos;s they them a bunch of cognitive tests , and the answer was not really . 
there was one however really interesting and telling the difference between the brains of memory control champions and the subjects that they were comparing to them . 
when they put these guys in an fmri machine , scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes , they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else . 
the note , they were using , or they seemed to be using , a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation . 
why ? and is there something the rest of us can learn from this ? 
the sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly , and then the rest of the field has to play catchup . 
this is my friend ben pridmore , three -- time world champion memory . 
on his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour , using a technique that he invented and he has mastered alone . 
he used a similar technique to memorize the order of four , precise 140 random binary digits in half an hour . 
yeah . 
and while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions , everything , all of the techniques that are being used , ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding . 
and &apos;s well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker / baker paradox , which goes like this : if i tell two people to remember the same word , if i say to you , &quot; remember that there is a guy named baker . &quot; 
that's his name . 
and i say to you , &quot; remember that there is a guy who is a baker . &quot; 
and i come back to you at some point later on , and i say , &quot; do you remember that word that i told you a while back ? 
do you remember what it was ? &quot; 
the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker . 
same amount of different word , remembering ; that's weird . 
what's going on here ? 
well the name baker doesn't actually mean anything to you . 
it is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull . 
but the common noun bakers baker , we know it . 
bakers wear funny white hats . 
have bakers flour on their hands . 
bakers smell good running when they come from work . 
maybe we know it evan a baker . 
and when we first hear that word , we start putting these associational it hooks into that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date . 
one of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2 , 500 years to ancient greece . 
it came to be known as the memory palace . 
the story behind its creation goes like this : there was a poet called simonides who was attending a banquet . 
he was actually the hired entertainment , because back then if you wanted to throw a party , you really slamming didn't hire a d. j. , you hired a poet . 
and he stands up , his delivers poem from memory , walks out the door , and at the moment he does , the banquet hall collapses , kills everybody inside . 
it just doesn't collaborators at kill everybody , or the mangles bodies beyond all recognition . 
nobody can say who was inside , nobody can say where they were sitting . 
the bodies can't properly be buried . 
another one &apos;s compounding tragedy . 
simonides , standing outside , the sole survivor amid the wreckage closes his eyes , and has this realization , which is that in his eye mind's , he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting . 
and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage . 
if i asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story that i just told you about simonides , chances are you would have a tough time with it . 
but i would wager that if i asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a tan le talking horse foyer in your right now , you would be able to see that . 
this is advice that goes back 10,000 years -- two plus to the earliest latin treatises memory . 
so how does this work ? 
let's say that you've been invited to ted center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory , and you want to do it the way that cicero would have done it if he had been invited to tedxrome 2 10,000 years ago . 
what you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house . 
and you'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy , ridiculous , unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this bizarre totally contest . 
and then you'd go inside your house , and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed . 
and that would remind you that you would want to introduce your friend then ed cook . 
and then you'd see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell . 
and you go into your kitchen , and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange you journey that went on for a year , and you have some friends to help you remember that . 
this is how roman orators memorized their speeches -- not -- -- word for word , which is just going to screw you up , but -- -- for topic topic . 
in fact , the phrase &quot; topic sentence , &quot; that comes from the greek word &quot; topos , &quot; which means &quot; place . &quot; 
a that's vestige of when people used to think about oratory + rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms . 
the phrase &quot; in the first place , &quot; that's like in the first place of your memory palace . 
i thought this was just fascinating , and i really got into it . 
and i went to a few more of these memory contests . 
and i had this notion that i might write something about this longer subculture of competitive memorizers . 
but there was a call . 
the call that was a memory is a contest pathologically boring event . 
truly , it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the sats . 
i mean , the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples . 
and i'm a journalist , i need something to write about . 
i know it that there's this incredible stuff happening in these people's don't minds , but i have access to it . 
and i realized , if i was going to tell this story , i needed to walk in their shoes , a little bit . 
and so i started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times just trying to remember something . 
maybe it was a poem . 
maybe it was names from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market . 
and i found that this was shockingly fun . 
i never would have expected that . 
it was fun because this is actually not about training your memory . 
what is doing you're you're trying to get better and better and better at creating , at dreaming , up these utterly ludicrous , hopefully , raunchy hilarious and unforgettable images in your mind's eye . 
and i got pretty into it . 
this is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit . 
&apos;s a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over two , except for small pinholes because distraction is the greatest competitive memorizer's enemy . 
i ended up coming back to that same contest that i had covered a year earlier . 
and i had this notion that i might enter it sort of , as an experiment in participatory journalism . 
it'd make , i thought , maybe a nice epilogue to all my research . 
call was the experiment went haywire . 
i won the contest , which really wasn't supposed to happen . 
now it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists , but &apos;s actually kind of beside the point . 
these are just tricks . 
they are tricks that work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work . 
and you have to be don't building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works . 
we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift , but that is not the case . 
great memories are learned . 
at the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention . 
we remember when we are deeply engaged . 
the memory palace , these techniques memory , just they're shortcuts . 
in fact , not they're evan really shortcuts . 
they work because they make you work . 
they force , a kind of depth of processing , a kind of mindfulness , that most of us don't normally exercising walk around . 
but actually there are no shortcuts . 
how is this stuff is made memorable . 
i learned that there are incredible firsthand memory capacities latent in all of us . 
but if you want to memorable global live a life , you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember . 
thank you . 
angela lee duckworth : the grit key to success ? 
when i was 27 years old , i left a very demanding management consulting job in for a job that was more demanding eg : teaching . 
i went to teach math seventh graders use in the new york city schools . 
and like any teacher , i made quizzes + tests . 
it &apos;s i. out homework assignments . 
when the work came back , i calculated grades . 
what struck me was that i.q. is was not the only difference between my best and my worst students . 
some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric i.q. is scores . 
some of my kids smartest weren't doing so well . 
and that got me thinking . 
the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math , sure , they're hard : ratios , decimals , the area of a parallelogram . 
but these concepts are not impossible , and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough . 
after several more years of teaching , i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational , perspective from a psychological perspective . 
in education , the one thing we know it to measure how best is i.q. is , but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ? 
so i left the classroom , and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist . 
i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings , and in every study my question is , who was successful here and why ? 
my research team and i went to west point military academy . 
we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out . 
we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would farthest in advance competition . 
we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students ? 
we partnered with private companies , asking , which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs ? 
and the most who's going to earn money ? 
in all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success . 
and it wasn't social intelligence . 
it looks good wasn't , physical health , and it wasn't i.q. is 
it was grit . 
passion is grit and perseverance for very long term -- goals . 
grit is having stamina . 
grit is sticking with your future , day in and day out , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make a future that reality . 
grit is living life &apos;s like a marathon , not a sprint . 
a few years ago , i started studying grit in the chicago use schools . 
i asked thousands of high school juniors to take questionnaires grit waited around , and then more than a year to see who would graduate . 
turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate , evan when i matched them on every characteristic i could measure , things like income family , standardized achievement test scores , evan how felt safe kids when they were at school . 
so &apos;s not just at west point or the national spelling bee grit matters . that &apos;s also in school , especially for kids at risk for dropping out . 
to me , the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know it , how little knows science , about building it . 
every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; how do i build grit in kids ? 
what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic ? 
how do i keep them motivated for the long run ? &quot; 
the honest answer is , i know it don't . 
what i do know it is that you make gritty doesn't talent . 
our data very clearly show that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments . 
in fact , in our data , grit is usually evan inversely related or unrelated to measures of talent . 
so far , the best idea i've heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; growth mindset . &quot; 
this is an idea developed by carol dweck at stanford university , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change your with effort . 
dr : dweck has shown that when kids learn and read about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge , they're much more likely to persevere when they fail , because they believe that don't failure is a permanent condition . 
so growth mindset is a great idea for building grit . 
but we need more . 
and where that's i'm going to end , because my remarks that's where we are . 
that's the work that stands before us . 
we need to take our best ideas , our intuitions strongest , and we need to test them . 
we need to measure whether we &apos;ve been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start over again with lessons learned . 
in other words , we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier . 
thank you . 
xavier vilalta : running at its community in architecture 
my work focuses on the connection of both our community life thinking about being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions . 
today i brought two recent projects as an example of this . 
both projects are in emerging countries , one in ethiopia and another one in tunisia . 
and they also have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture . 
the first example started with an invitation to design a shopping mall in multistory ethiopia's capital city addis ababa . 
and this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design . 
at first , the first thing i thought was , i want to run away . 
after seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points . 
first , these buildings , they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things . 
second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling . 
in a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year . 
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa + with ethiopia . 
it is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions . 
also during our first visit to ethiopia , i was really captivated by the old merkato is that this structure -- open air where thousands of people , they go and buy things from small vendors every day . 
and it has also use this idea of the space that uses the outdoors to create activity . 
so i thought , this is what i really want to design , not a shopping mall . 
but the question was how we could do a multistory , contemporary building with these principles . 
the next challenge was when we looked at the site , that is , in a really for area of the city , where most of these buildings that you see in the image , they were not there . 
and also &apos;s between two parallel don't streets that have any connection for hundreds of meters . 
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building . 
and this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open -- air space in the building itself -- self that protects with its own shape from the sun and the rain . 
and around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops , that change in each floor because of the shape of the void . 
i also thought , how to close the building ? 
and i really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local conditions climate . 
and i started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a filtered way . 
and then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the ethiopian women's dresses . 
that they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade . 
and we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a way controlled inside the building . 
and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night . 
with these ideas first it was not easy to convince the developers because they were like , &quot; this is not a shopping mall . we didn't ask for that . &quot; 
but then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall basically because they had to sell more shops . 
and also that the idea of the facade was much , much cheaper , not only because of the material compared with the glass , but also because we need to have air conditioning didn't anymore . 
so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project . 
and the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building -- self sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day . 
so we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof . 
and then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new use gathering space with bars and areas that would create this urban oasis . 
and these porches on the roof , all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside . 
hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction . 
the second example is a master plan of two 10,000 apartments and facilities in the city of tunis . 
and for doing such a big project , the biggest project i've ever designed , i really needed to understand the city of tunis , but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture . 
during that analysis i paid attention to the special medina is that this 1,000 -- -- year old structure that used to be closed by a wall , twelve by different gates opened , connected by almost straight lines . 
when i went to the site , the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets , creating 12 initial blocks in size and characteristics similar to the ones we have in + with other cities with these courtyards in europe . 
on top of that , we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines , and this initial modified this pattern . 
and the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan . 
and for that i thought , what would be the best orientation in the mediterranean climate for an apartment ? 
and &apos;s north -- south , because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation . 
so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction . 
and this is the result that is almost like a combination of the european block and the arab city . 
it has these blocks with courtyards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connexions for the pedestrians . 
and it also responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor . 
and it reinforces also this idea of the gates . 
the roof , which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community and the space taken by the construction . 
and &apos;s where all the neighbors , they can go up and socialize , and do activities such as having a -- two kilometer run in the morning , from jumping building to one another . 
these two examples , they have a common approach in the design process . 
and also , they are emerging in countries where you can see the cities for literally . 
in these cities , the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow . 
for this reason , i see evan more importance to look at the architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect people and nature . 
thank you very much . 
onora o &apos;neill : what we understand about trust don't 
so i'm going to talk about trust , and i'm going to start by reminding you views of the standard that people have about trust . 
i think these are so commonplace , they've become clich é s of our society . 
and i think there are three . 
a one's claim : there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed . 
the second is an aim : we should have more trust . 
and the third is a task : we should rebuild trust . 
i think that the claim , the aim and the task are all misconceived . 
so what i'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which i think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter . 
the first claim : why do people think trust has declined ? 
and if i really think about it on the basis of my own evidence , i know it don't the answer . 
i'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others . 
i have an don't overview . 
but , of course , i can look at the opinion polls , and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined . 
when you actually look at opinion polls across time , not much there's evidence for that . 
that's to say , the people who were mistrusted 20 years ago , principally + journalists , politicians are still mistrusted . 
and the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted : judges , nurses . 
the rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly midway . 
but is that good evidence ? 
what opinion polls record is , of course , opinions . 
what else can they record ? 
so they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report certain when you ask them questions . 
do you trust politicians ? do you trust teachers ? 
now if somebody said to you , &quot; do you trust greengrocers ? 
do you trust fishmongers ? 
do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot; 
you would probably begin by saying , &quot; what to do ? &quot; 
and that would be a perfectly sensible response . 
and you might say , when you understood the answer to that , &quot; well , i trust some of them , but not others . &quot; 
that's a perfectly rational thing . 
in short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a way differentiated . 
we don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office -- or holder type of person is going to be uniform . 
i might say , for example , that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know it to teach the reception class to read , but in no way to drive the minibus school . 
i know it might , after all , that she wasn't a good driver . 
i might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret . 
simple . 
so if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we drop all that sort of intelligence when we think more abstractly about trust ? 
i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists , because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust . 
secondly , what about the aim ? 
the aim is to have more trust . 
well , frankly , i think a that's aim stupid . 
&apos;s not what i would aim at . 
i would have more aim to trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy . 
in fact , i aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy . 
and i think , of those people who , for example , placed their savings with the mr . very aptly named . madoff , who then made off with them , and i think of them , and i think , well , yes , too much trust . 
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life . 
intelligently placed + intelligently refused trust is the proper aim . 
well , that one once says one says , yeah , okay , that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness . 
&apos;s judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects . 
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things . 
they are honest competent ? are they ? are they reliable ? 
and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable + we'll honest , have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they'll be trustworthy . 
but if , on the other hand , they're unreliable , we might not . 
i have friends who are competent + honest , but i would not trust them to post a letter , because they're forgetful . 
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but i realize that they overestimate their own competence . 
and i'm very glad to say , i think i have many don't friends who are extremely reliable but competent + dishonest . 
so , if i haven't spotted it yet . 
but what that's we're looking for : trustworthiness before trust . 
trust is the response . 
trustworthiness is what we have to judge . and , of course , that &apos;s difficult . 
across the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals + officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness . 
a lot of these systems have the converse effect . 
they don't as they're supposed to work . 
i remember i was talking with a midwife who said , &quot; well , you see , the call to do is it takes longer than the paperwork to deliver the baby . &quot; 
and all over our life , institutional use our life , we find that call , that the system of accountability that is meant to secure and trustworthiness evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite . 
it is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks , like midwives , from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes , as we say . 
you can all examples give your own there . 
so so much for the aim . 
&apos;s not easy . it is judgment , and simple reaction , attitudes , don't do adequately here . 
now thirdly , the task . 
calling the task rebuilding trust , i think , also gets things backwards . 
it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust . 
well , we can do that for ourselves . 
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness . 
we can do it together two people trying to improve trust . 
but trust , in the end , is because distinctive &apos;s given by other people . 
you can't rebuild what other people give you . 
you have to give them the basis for giving you their trust . 
so you have to , i think , be trustworthy . 
and that , of course , is because you can't fool all of the people of all the time , usually . 
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy . 
how to do it ? 
well every day , all over the place , that &apos;s being done by ordinary people , by officials , by institutions , quite effectively . 
let me give you a simple commercial example . 
the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back , and they don't ask any questions . 
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color , i wanted . 
that's super . i trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me . 
i think there's a big lesson in that . 
if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying . 
so in the end , i think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern . 
it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy . 
thanks . 
colin stokes : how movies teach manhood 
you know it , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies , i get to watch . 
i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; the wizard of oz &quot; together . 
it her imagination totally dominated for months . 
her favorite character was glinda , of course . 
it &apos;s a great i.t. her excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand . 
but you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is . 
now we global live today , and are raising our children , in a kind of -- children's fantasy -- -- spectacular industrial complex . 
but , &quot; the wizard of oz &quot; stood alone . 
it did not start that trend . 
forty years later when the trend was really caught on , with , interestingly , another movie that featured a metal guy and a girl by a guy furry rescuing dressing up as the enemy's guards . 
what do you know it i'm talking about ? 
yeah . 
now , there's a big difference between these two movies , a couple of really big differences between &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; and all the movies we watch today . 
one is very little there's violence in &quot; the wizard of oz . &quot; 
the monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees . 
but i think , &quot; if the wizard of oz , &quot; were made today , the wizard would say , &quot; dorothy , you are the savior of oz that the prophecy foretold . 
use your magic slippers to defeat the computer -- generated armies of the wicked witch . &quot; 
but that's not how it happens . 
another thing that's really unique about &quot; the wizard of oz , &quot; to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and evan villainous characters are female . 
now i started to notice when i showed this actually &quot; star wars &quot; to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different . 
at that point , i also had a son . 
he was only three at the time . 
he was not invited to the screening . he was too young for that . 
but he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted . 
so he wandered in , and it imprinted on him like a duck mommy does to its duckling , and i think he understands don't what's going on , but he is sure soaking in it . 
and i wonder what he's soaking in . 
he is picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty ? 
he is picking up on the fact that luke an joins the army to overthrow government ? 
compare this to 1939 with &quot; the wizard of oz . &quot; 
how does dorothy win her movie ? 
by making friends with everybody and being a leader . 
that's kind of the world i'd rather raise my kids in -- oz , right ? -- and not the world of dudes fighting , which is where we kind of have to be . 
why is there so much force -- capital f , force -- in the movies we have for our kids , and so little yellow brick road ? 
there is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy -- violent movie has on girls , and you should do reading . that &apos;s very good . 
i read haven't as much on how who are picking up on this vibe . 
i know it from my own experience that princess leia did not provide the adequate context that i could have used in the navigating adult world that is co -- ed . 
i think there was a moment -- first kiss when i really expected to start the credits rolling that's because the end of the movie , right ? 
i finished my quest , i got the girl . 
why are you still standing there ? 
i know it don't what i'm supposed to do . 
the movies are very , very focused on the defeating villain and getting your there's reward , and not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys . 
&apos;s almost as though you're a boy , if you are a dopey animal , and if you are a girl , you should bring your warrior costume . 
there are plenty of exceptions , and i will defend the disney any princesses in front of you . 
but they do send a message to who , that they are not , the who are not really the target audience . 
they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy , but they are not necessarily who showing how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy . 
no there's models for them . 
and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as -- three dimensional + delightful as hermione + katniss are , these are still war movies . 
until , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; brave . &quot; 
i recommend it to all of you , that &apos;s now on demand . 
do you remember what the critics said , &quot; when brave &quot; came out ? 
&quot; aw , i believe can't pixar princess made a movie . &quot; 
very good . let &apos;s don't that stop you . 
now , almost none of these movies bechdel pass the test . 
i know it don't if you've heard of this . 
it has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement . 
alison bechdel is a comic book artist , and back in the mid 1980s -- &apos; s , she had she'd recorded this conversation with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw . 
and &apos;s very simple . there's just three questions you should ask : is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ? 
so try to meet that bar . 
and these women do talk to each other at any point in the movie ? 
and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ? 
right ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff . 
it does happen . i've seen it , and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know it and love . 
in fact , this week , i went to see a very high quality -- the movie , &quot; argo . &quot; 
right ? oscar buzz , doing great at the box office , a consensus idea of what a quality hollywood film is . 
it pretty much the flunks bechdel test . 
and i think don't it should , because a lot of the movie , i know it don't you've if seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis . 
we &apos;ve got quite a few scenes of the men having deep search , angst ridden conversations hideout -- in this , and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , &quot; you are coming to bed , honey ? &quot; 
that's hollywood for you . 
so let's look at the numbers . 
2011 , one of the most popular movies , how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists ? 
eleven , that &apos;s not bad . 
&apos;s not as many percent as the number of women we &apos;ve just elected to congress , that's so good . 
but there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring down this room . 
last year , the new york times published a study that the government had done . 
here's what it said . 
one out of five women in america say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life . 
now , i think don't that's the fault of popular entertainment . 
i think don't kids' movies have anything to do with that . 
i think that evan don't pornography or music videos are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when i hear that statistic , one of the things i think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants . 
these guys who are learning ? what are they ? 
what are they failing to learn ? 
are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak ? 
are we soaking up that story ? 
you know it , as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them . 
i mean , i think the netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important , and mainly i'm talking to the dads here . 
i think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood . 
the definition of manhood is already turning upside down . 
you've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver + wage earner . 
they're throwing it up in the air . 
when i asked my daughter who was her favorite character in &quot; star wars , &quot; do you know it what she said ? 
obi -- wan . 
obi -- wan kenobi + glinda . 
what do these two have in common ? 
maybe &apos;s not just the sparkly dress . 
i think these people are experts . 
i think these are the two people in the movie who know it more than anybody else , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential . 
now , they are leaders . 
i like that kind of quest for my daughter , and i like that kind of quest for my son . 
i want more quests like that . 
thank you . 
mohamed ali : the link between unemployment and terrorism 
i would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid . 
i know it don't his name , but i do know it his story . 
he lives in a small village in southern somalia . 
his village is near mogadishu . 
drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation . 
with nothing left there for him , he leaves for the big city , in this case , mogadishu , the capital of somalia . 
when he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward . 
he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of mogadishu . 
maybe a year passes , nothing . 
one day , he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast . 
he meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break . 
he's given a bit of money to buy some himself new clothes , money to send running back to his family . 
he is introduced to this young woman . 
he eventually gets married . 
he starts this new life . 
he has a purpose in life . 
one day in mogadishu , beautiful under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off . 
that small town kid with the big city was the suicide bomber dreams , and that dynamic group of people were al shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al qaeda . 
so how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big city in the end up with him blowing himself up ? 
he was waiting . 
he was waiting for an opportunity , his future begin to waiting , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along . 
this was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood . 
and his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world . 
it is the story of the unemployed disenfranchised and urban youth who sparks riots in johannesburg , sparks riots in london , who reaches out for something other than waithood . 
for young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities . 
often &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates . 
by 2030s happen , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. 
if we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0. 
and in my city of birth , mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment . 
70 percent , work don't don't go to school . 
they pretty much do nothing . 
i went back to mogadishu last month , and i went to visit madina hospital , i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing in front of that hospital -- bullet ridden thinking , what if i had never left ? 
what if i had been forced into that same state of waithood ? 
i would have become a terrorist ? 
i'm not really sure about the answer . 
my reason for being in mogadishu that was actually a month to host youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit . 
i brought together about 90 young somali leaders . 
we sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city . 
one of the young men in the room was aden . 
he went to university in mogadishu , graduated . 
there were no jobs , no opportunities . 
i remember him telling me , because he was a college , graduate unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited . 
they sought people like him out . 
but his story takes a different route . 
in mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point a to point b are the roads . 
twenty years of civil war -- three have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around . 
aden saw an opportunity and seized it . 
he started a motorbike company . 
he began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them . 
he bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually to expand several hundred within the next three years . 
how is this story different ? 
what makes his story different ? 
i believe it is his ability to identify + seize a new opportunity . 
&apos;s entrepreneurship , and i believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood . 
it empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic so they are seeking desperately opportunities . 
and you can train young people to be entrepreneurs . 
i want to talk to you about a young man who attended meetings , one of my doctor-heroes mohamoud , a florist . 
he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship . 
actually the first he's florist mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until doctor-heroes came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad . 
if someone asked you , &quot; when was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot; for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; never . &quot; 
so doctor-heroes saw an opportunity . 
he started a landscaping + design floral company . 
he created a farm right outside of mogadishu , and started for tulips + lilies , which he said could survive the harsh mogadishu climate . 
and he began to flowers delivering weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he's now working on creating mogadishu's use first park in 22 years . 
there's use no park in mogadishu . 
he wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the roses proverbial . 
and he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water , by the way . 
so the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , mohamed's presence really had a profound impact on the youth in that room . 
they had never really thought about starting up a business . 
they've thought about working for an ngo , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them . 
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity . 
he empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers . 
by the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city . 
they came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems . 
so inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital their ideas to make a reality . 
they need to mentorship expertise and guide them in developing + launching their businesses . 
connect young people with the resources they need them , provide the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth . 
for me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business . 
&apos;s about creating a social impact . 
mohamed is not simply selling flowers . 
i believe he is selling hope . 
his peace that's park , and what he calls , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city . 
aden street hired kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him . 
it &apos;s he them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood . 
these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities . 
so my suggestion is youth , turn into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and peace parks than the car and waithood bombs . 
thank you . 
shaolan : learn to read chinese ... with ease ! 
for up in taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of chinese characters . 
ever since then , i was fascinated by this incredible language . 
but to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china . 
over the past few years , i've been wondering if i can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so . 
i started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning chinese might be useful . 
since the age of five , i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence . 
i learned the characters every day during the course of the next 15 years . 
since we only have five minutes , that &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way . 
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters . 
you only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy . 
the top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road , signs restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers . 
today i'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works . 
are you ready ? 
open your mouth as wide as possible until &apos;s square . 
you get a mouth . 
this is a person going for a walk . 
person . 
this is a tree . 
tree . 
this is a mountain . 
the sun . 
the purple moon which . 
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west . 
i call these characters radicals eight . 
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters . 
a person . 
if someone walks , behind that is &quot; to follow . &quot; 
as the old saying goes , two , three is company is a crowd . 
if a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; it was this big . &quot; 
the person inside the mouth , the person is trapped . 
he's a prisoner , just like jonah inside the whale . 
one tree is a tree . two trees together , we have the woods . 
three trees together , we create the forest . 
put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation . 
put a mouth on the top of the tree , that's &quot; idiot . &quot; 
easy to remember , a since talking tree is pretty idiotic . 
remember fire ? 
two fires together , i get really hot . 
three fires that's together , a lot of flames . 
the set fire underneath the two trees , &apos;s burning . 
for us , the sun is the source of prosperity . 
two suns together , prosperous . 
three together , that's sparkles . 
and the purple moon which put the sun shining &apos;s brightness , together . 
it also means tomorrow , after a day and a night . 
the sun is coming up above the horizon . sunrise . 
a door ; put a plank inside the door , door &apos;s a bolt . 
put a mouth inside the door , asking questions . 
knock knock . is running anyone ? 
this person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading . 
on the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , they have an argument . 
three women together , be careful , &apos;s adultery . 
so we have gone through almost 30 characters . 
by using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. 
the next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. 
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese -- -- eight year old . 
so after we know it the characters , we start building phrases . 
for example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire . mountain &apos;s a volcano . 
we know it japan is the land of the rising sun . 
this is a sun placed with the origin , because japan lies to the east of china . 
so again , sun origin together , we build japan . 
a person behind japan , what do we get ? 
a japanese person . 
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other . 
in ancient china , that means in exile , because chinese emperors , they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains . 
nowadays , exile has turned into getting out . 
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit . 
this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage . thank you .
