jay meg : why 30 is not new 20 .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need psychiatric patient treatments .  (2)
when i was a college in berkeley read clinical psychologist . they 3d students .  (3)
she was a woman named alex 26 .  (4)
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the directly into my office , sit in on the couch , kick off her shoes , and she said to me , is to tell me about men &apos;s question .  (5)
when i heard this , i disengaged .  (6)
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk about my boys .  (8)
i thought i could manage this thing .  (9)
but i can &apos;t do that .  (10)
alex in every meeting , will bring funny story , so to me 点点 head out on , and the result of the time is a very relaxing things .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is a new 20th , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
in order to have to work , marry later , to have to have children later , even after death is to have .  (13)
and i was just like alex 二十几岁 people outside , except for nothing .  (14)
but not too long , i started to push it on my 催 alex love life .  (15)
i refuse .  (16)
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time in the best is before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists call &quot; and so ! &quot; moment .  (20)
in that moment , i learned 30 is not new 二十岁 .  (21)
yeah , people more than ever late 安顿 down , but it doesn &apos;t mean that this is alex 二十几岁 between her development 低谷 .  (22)
this makes alex 二十几岁 development of a good time , and we sat spoil it .  (23)
and then i understood that &quot; kindness &quot; oversight is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love for life around 二十几岁 people with the family .  (24)
now , america had about 5千万 二十几岁 people .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think about nobody can &apos;t experience 二十几岁 stage in this case after adults period .  (26)
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand .  (27)
i really want to see here 一些二十几岁 people .  (28)
excellent ! you &apos;re awesome .  (29)
if you work with 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people and lost o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people , very important .  (30)
this is not my point . it &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human lifetime 80 percent of the most important moment occurred in 35 years old .  (32)
that means every 10 determines your life would be the kind of experience with &quot; and it turns out that there are eight of ! &quot; moment occurred in 30 中旬 .  (33)
over 40 years , who don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money you will make a very big impact .  (36)
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 before and mate 终生 married , 同居 , or on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain when 二十几岁 adults to adapt to the second issue is the last time into a long-term peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change yourself , what is now change its time .  (38)
we know life than other stages when 二十岁 personality of the biggest change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , get to the summit , 35 years old and that &apos;s a little hard to do .  (39)
so you this 二十几岁 between is tell your own body situation and the choice of the time .  (40)
so when we talk about children &apos;s development , we all know about five years before language and admiration brain development is the critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life will produce for your future impact time period .  (42)
but we hear a few is have something called adults development , and our 二十岁 this stage is adult development of the critical period .  (43)
but this is not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
researchers have called 二十几岁 extending adolescence .  (46)
journalist for 二十几岁 stupid people additional names , like , &quot; the guardian &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , we get is actually adults 期中 known as the most important decades doesn &apos;t matter .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , you need a plan and not enough time .  (50)
this is not right ?  (51)
so , when you take a 二十几岁 people heads and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start lifestyle , &quot; what happens when you think ?  (52)
nothing happens .  (53)
you take that guy and urgency worked , but nothing happened .  (54)
or &quot; everybody says to me at 30 just before i started my career , no problem . &quot; this kind of thing .  (55)
but then they start : &quot; my 二十岁 quickly ended , but nothing i can show .  (56)
i graduated day best 写写 my résumé . &quot;  (57)
and then they start : &quot; when 二十几岁 date like playing games in seats .  (58)
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but to about 30 music is cut off a after another , you start to sit down .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &apos; &apos; chair . &quot;  (60)
here are 二十几岁 where ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
okay , that just might sound like a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , in this very high currency .  (63)
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure .  (64)
there are many of these things are not compatible , and started studying like that , in this phase 三十几岁 and do so many things harder pressure and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
on a millennium after middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy .  (66)
that is our profession doesn &apos;t want to .  (67)
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or cannot give their kids a sibling .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people do and what we think .  (69)
let me tell you a story about how to do .  (70)
this is a story about a woman called emma story .  (71)
25 , emma because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at .  (73)
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she showed that worked 脾气 more and more than my boyfriend live together .  (74)
and whether she 二十几岁 how hard it is , her life was much more difficult .  (75)
she was meeting , crying , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walks in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she bought a new address thin , and she took one morning fill her connect people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this string of words -- &quot; the blank behind .  (78)
she almost 歇斯底里 of looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who would take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
now , i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot;  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her treatment architect .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex stuff , right after i learned a lot , so i &apos;m not going to make a decision that emma role decade that flow off .  (84)
so in the next weeks and months , i taught in every three emma 二十几岁 people , both men and women are supposed to hear things .  (85)
first , i told emma forget her identity crisis and started accumulate identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value .  (87)
do you think about this , and what it was like investment .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma profession future , and nobody knows their work future , but i know those : identity capital would come to employ more identity capital .  (89)
this is a professional accept that multinational , internships that job and you want to step up to the time .  (90)
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to speak , cannot called exploration .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count .  (93)
secondly , i told emma cities tribes overestimate .  (94)
the new capital , the new can get almost always about people from inside the external communities .  (95)
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends .  (96)
yes , about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment .  (97)
but half is not that connection is weak , and put yourself in a group that way .  (98)
half the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connecting to your neighbor boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 working methods .  (99)
this is not cheating . this is information about how to communicate science .  (100)
and finally , emma believe that people don &apos;t choose a family , but we can choose friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people &apos;s emma , soon to pass and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family .  (102)
i tell emma choice family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a 30 than 20 , 25 is even better off of the time , and i agreed .  (104)
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your or 同居 sleep people don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
and in the best &apos;s marriage kung fu time is married before , which means to treat love is treated as rich work like that .  (106)
choice family is conscious choices that you want people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose your person waste of time .  (107)
and then emma how ?  (108)
well , we went back into the address thin , and she found her an old roommate a family in another state of an art museum work .  (109)
the weak connection to help her where you find a job .  (110)
and that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons .  (111)
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners .  (112)
she and her doctor consciously chose people get married .  (113)
she loved her new career , she loved his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 fence seems a big enough . &quot; 的卡 pieces .  (114)
emma stories make this thing that sounds very simple , but this is my favorite and 二十几岁 people work reasons .  (115)
it &apos;s too easy to help them .  (116)
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport destination somewhere in the west flights .  (117)
after the launch , vector adjust is a little further and further in alaska in fiji difference .  (118)
likewise , at 21 or even 25 29岁 , it &apos;s a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 down is that even a few generations have very big impact .  (119)
this gives a worth spreading give each of you know who 二十几岁 ideas .  (120)
it and i learned to follow alex saying as simple .  (121)
are you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition .  (122)
now , you &apos;re in determines your life .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
李镇河 : 李镇河 into computer : &quot; real world , you play &quot; infinite imagination  (125)
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , we still have a reality and virtual worlds . gap between the virtual world , our imagination is infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in shortens and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap to shorten less than one millimeter , is a touchscreen glass that thin , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there .  (127)
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between how much better ?  (128)
so i started to try this crazy idea .  (129)
i first built out of this tool , it can number into space , if you compare this with a pen that force on the screen , and a pen pen and goes into a little pixels of virtual worlds .  (130)
designers directly in three-dimensional space to achieve their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery .  (131)
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of borders between .  (132)
but we still &apos;s hands on the screen .  (133)
how can we reach into to communicate with digital information interaction , and use our flexible hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 re-engineered this computer put keyboard on top of a small space move into the number of jobs .  (135)
because in reality window and file space with a particular location , they pick become like from the shelves take book so easily .  (136)
and you can read this book and floating in every window and virtual touch board out across words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands or stretched rotate all kinds of models .  (138)
in these examples have shown that we &apos;re now entering the digital world .  (139)
but how we can change its position to make digital information into our world ?  (140)
that many people here have online shopping and 退货 experience .  (141)
but now than you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 in line .  (143)
this is the system we analyzed body geometric features later , driving through the first football or a way to look at that show us situations .  (144)
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make our space these visible pixels points into actually can touch it , to feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve 雷米 persian , common to make it a &quot; matter pixels points . &quot;  (147)
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 like we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and people will move the object into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place .  (148)
we make the basic principles are , to eliminate gravity pellets role magnetically levitated , and through mechanical sense , technology and drive it together to control pellets movement .  (149)
right through this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to liberate time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , people could movement in the physical world , can be recorded , back and forever , keep .  (150)
so , dance 编排 can be remote and real to teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 movement , and you can actually being repeated itself .  (151)
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , is this learning process is real , you can touch it , it felt , was to force .  (152)
more exciting is that this is not the computer put things into a real stuff , but to imagine , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity .  (153)
and as you can see , digital information will just make things that give us , but will start acts as we become part of our physical environment , not cut our relationship with the real world .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; border &quot; from the beginning , if we could remove the border , the rest is our enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)

to a new culture and environment , as i read habits , compared to a new culture and environment , as i read a habit .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , when i first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from small to large use world map .  (189)
never before i realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily need to map , central in the world .  (190)
this map with some perspective .  (191)
compare reading is not new .  (192)
it &apos;s in academia standard approach .  (193)
比较文学 , even more religious become specialized . field 比较文学 , even more religious become specialized research .  (194)
compare and contrast scholars for a project has a full understanding . contrast to control scholars for a project has a full understanding .  (195)

there is no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ?  (285)
other emotion would allow us to see their hostility , your intentions ugly heart and what they deserve ?  (286)
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ?  (287)
freud shortly after that wrote that .  (288)
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think his wife disobedience . he &apos;s so 憔悴 ours  (289)
freud think this guy kind of weird because he doesn &apos;t really concerned with his wife do anything .  (290)
because his wife was innocent , you all know .  (291)
this poor guys just 缘由 to have any doubts  (292)
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move .  (293)
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she was really mindlessly meet the man ?  (294)
freud said this man was into his wife unconscious behaviors guard .  (295)
fiction writing about this very well .  (296)
it should be able to describe envy novel training pitch is how we see , it &apos;s not gets it right .  (297)
well , we get jealous more intense , we will be more frequently fantasy .  (298)
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do violence or anything illegal .  (299)
envy causes us behavior becomes extreme .  (300)
i admit that i got myself when i was eight , but also in the news came to see a story .  (301)
michigan 一个52岁 women were discovered register a facebook account phony-baloney and used to account for their year sending out the malicious news .  (302)
a year . for one year .  (303)
she &apos;s trying to her 陷害 before the aisles now girlfriend i must admit , when i heard this , and my reaction is for she admired  (304)
because , i want to say , you face reality .  (305)
ah ! just how creative in the wrong place , isn &apos;t it ?  (306)
this is from a novel .  (307)
a pie 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 novel .  (308)
海史密斯 is my favorite writers and  (309)
she is american 文学史 on brilliant and 诡 one page .  (310)
for example , tom universal interest in her case , the most famous character .  (311)
you want to start 里普利 or want what you have to be , then you , and you have you ever have locked in his basement 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account .  (312)
this is a road .  (313)
but we do ? we cannot repeat 里普利 road .  (314)
i cannot tell the world has dramatically , even if i would one day be able to do this .  (315)
and unfortunately , because we live in admire era .  (316)
we live in envy era .  (317)
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , isn &apos;t it ?  (318)
we can give novel solutions , i &apos;m not sure ?  (319)
so we &apos;ll 学学 fictional characters , they look at the met puzzles , when things don &apos;t know how to do .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to ask the 贝克街 221 夏洛克 de 福尔摩斯 b .  (321)
when people think 福尔摩斯 would want to his adversaries mo 里亚蒂 professor this crime genius  (322)
but i &apos;ve been more like an epidemic 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face a scottish 头子 he really needed to 福尔摩斯 his intelligence , but hate him .  (323)
oh , i had not familiar with this again .  (324)
雷斯 垂 de he needs help , and he hated the mystery of the cases 侦破 always 苦闷 story again .  (325)
we proud of you . &quot;  (326)
it said in the field , nobody would not want to hold hands 福尔摩斯  (327)
this is what we saw 少数几次 福尔摩斯 in the human being moved , and when i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it seems to envy as a geometric problem , instead of emotions .  (329)
this minute , standing 福尔摩斯 雷斯 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand on one side .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he used to hate .  (332)
but what &apos;s so simple ?  (333)
if it was really jealous of a geometric problem to do , a story about how we choose your relationship with other questions ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate somebody talent .  (335)
we &apos;ll chase effort .  (336)
but i love contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when we come to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
fiction is already going on with envy  (339)
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it , please .  (340)
look at it and who are called came : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy shree millions , still has 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there myself .  (341)
we have excellent partners .  (342)
thank you .  (343)
ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash .  (344)
i was 10 or so , once and dad went up to 阿第伦 chris camp . that &apos;s a mountain in the new york northern wild zone .  (345)
it was really good weather .  (346)
the forest searched twinkling lights .  (347)
next shine sunlight , like leaves , when from the 晶莹 stained glass -- little feet , if there &apos;s no way , we can actually is at first we pretend that this piece of the human .  (348)
we eventually arrived at our camp .  (349)
that &apos;s on a cliff camp , overlooking a 水晶 next to a beautiful 晶莹 lakes . then i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
and in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 the largest garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apples nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing .  (352)
people to camp was too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would clean 善后 for them ?  (353)
this question bedeviled at all . i became a longer sound bite .  (354)
who cleaned the trash to leave us ?  (355)
but you can take this issue on any place you live in cloth 伊斯坦 . we leave out the garbage ?  (356)
in rio cleaned we leave the garbage ? in paris and london ?  (357)
in new york , here , is sanitation trucks were parked department cleaned up to 11 , we leave 000吨 trash every day , and the 2000吨 recycled garbage .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know who are doing this work .  (360)
wear sanitation trucks were parked on this up in a sense of responsibility for what ?  (361)
so i started a about sanitation trucks were parked workers research project .  (362)
i was sitting in the car , and along the track , interview in new york all the sanitation trucks were parked office workers live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now i &apos;m not sitting in 垃圾车 , i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 .  (366)
my own manipulate the electric 扫帚 scanners street , in the snow 铲 .  (367)
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process .  (368)
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell .  (369)
there is smell , but it &apos;s not what you think that bad . sometimes odor really bad . but you &apos;ll soon will adapt .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even a few years of working experience skilled worker , their bodies have adapted to try and weekly megatons of garbage .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
according to labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked jobs in america is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then slowly learned why .  (374)
you all day on the road , which are of traffic .  (375)
out of the car just trying to drive more than you , people often not enough to be careful .  (376)
for the sanitation trucks were parked workers , it was terrible .  (377)
and yet , garbage itself is full of poisons , these 毒物 often from 垃圾车 comes out , in a terrible harm .  (378)
i also learned the brutal and frightening .  (379)
when you go down , 路沿 sanitation trucks were parked car in the city , you &apos;ll see a slowly recognize garbage really like the power of nature itself .  (380)
it &apos;s never 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like breath , or a circular form .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , sanitation trucks were parked by workers called oriental into .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important labor . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient day landfill . landfill , from the container itself , bring it to poison in a very real way threats to our lives .  (387)
we attacked several century after decade 和数 diseases will again , we started threaten our health .  (388)
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw old stuff , we have no space something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less .  (390)
i &apos;m not suggesting that capitalism , here i just pointed out their relationship .  (391)
and the third reason -- is what i call our average and necessary , 经常性 activity speed .  (392)
i mean , in today &apos;s &apos; and days , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , repairing and clean and carried it around our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and they throw away , and forget about them , because we know that there will be a work in teams were sitting over there put these things is densest .  (395)
so today i want to urge you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked workers situation , maybe help that they &apos;re called . please bring them to participate in about how to build a sustainable city thousands of people .  (396)
i think their work is very noble .  (397)
every time they , in the street to individual hard work .  (398)
in many cities , they &apos;re wearing sanitation trucks were parked continues to work .  (399)
you know , they have to clean garbage on time .  (400)
they are allowing us to secure in their work .  (401)
they almost became secure work promise .  (402)
what they keep working for traffic safety ourselves without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and junk . this work traffic anyway -- to keep stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks and 咆哮 , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 week doing .  (404)
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just cry up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name was 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends .  (409)
i want to believe 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
cities junk , because we know of garbage actually only about three percent of all domestic garbage .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the garbage , please find a time , 致意 to them .  (415)
find a time to say thank you .  (416)

okay , open your eyes .  (438)
i &apos;ll give you an annual spring in new york are going to do a weird competition .  (439)
it &apos;s called america 冠军赛 memory .  (440)
a few years ago i as a journalist 科技类 this race to the part about trying to get there , like &quot; geeks who super bowl 冠军赛 as bustling . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of men and women 屈指可数 grew up in some old boy is still not aware of personal health  (442)
just look at some 奋力 in a situation laying down hundreds of any list of numbers .  (443)
some are trying to remember the names of populations strangers .  (444)
some think in the next few minutes trying to put the poetry  (445)
and in the game , who is the fastest way down to remember 一整副 打乱 card sequence .  (446)
i thought it was amazing .  (447)
these people surely talents unlike 禀  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this guy named ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to accept the best training memory .  (450)
i asked him , &quot; ed is when you start to realize their memories is genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; i &apos;m not experts ?  (452)
i actually very memory .  (453)
to participate for each one of them will tell you just average memory .  (454)
i &apos;m surprised when &quot; whoa , what i &apos;ve never heard ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall smart 过人 amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really want to teach in the u.s. national radio britney remember how 一整副 打乱 card sequence .  (459)
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; even though i &apos;m not britney , but you can also teach taught me !  (461)
we had to find an open to teach people why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 unfold in front of me .  (463)
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called e. p .  (466)
he suffers amnesia his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse amnesia themselves don &apos;t remember there really was amazing .  (468)
while he was a tragedy through his character , but we can understand memory in to what extent shape our personality .  (469)
this is another extreme i met somebody like this .  (470)
his name is kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the movie &quot; rain man &quot; characters in prototype .  (472)
and he took one afternoon in salt lake city public library , back to phone books , i think is just fascinating  (473)
i went home to read a lot to write essays about memory 两千多年 ago in latin wrote papers from ancient until then medieval time  (474)
i learned a lot of interesting things .  (475)
one is used to train illegal beam nurturing memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people to send in your memories could 不遗余力 to paint your mind .  (477)
these technologies allow modern life possible , but also we changed .  (478)
not only in the culture and i think in cognition  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to memory sometimes think how we already forgot to memory .  (480)
in this piece of the earth has very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam nurturing memory . it &apos;s an extraordinary memory .  (481)
it &apos;s not so extraordinary around the world are starting to do this .  (482)
i want to be obsessed with these people know how to do .  (483)
a few years ago london school of the university of researchers asked to a contest champion accept study memory .  (484)
they want to understand the human brain if we follow each other in structure anatomically different ?  (485)
the answer is no .  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny conclusion .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the brain memory contest champion brain were indeed there &apos;s an interesting question that very different .  (489)
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory number or or 人脸 kind pattern , researchers discovered memory champion challenges of our brain areas activated with no ordinary too .  (490)
notice that they use it in the brain in space and memory , it would take to navigate part .  (491)
why ? what can we figure out what the conclusion ?  (492)
竞争性 memory 较量 by a similar way toward the military competition 白热化 every year , someone with more effective way of memory show 赛场 and other people have to catch up  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore won three international competition champion memory .  (494)
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 sequence card to him for an hour down to remember all using a kind of his inventions , and he would only have the skills .  (495)
and it &apos;s similar to the way he had a word , not bad back off binary numbers 4140个 arbitrary folding only half an hour .  (496)
very impressive .  (497)
in these 参赛者 competition of using a lot of different memories of different ways of being applied to all these skills will end up going into a concept psychologists call a delicate code . &quot;  (498)
this idea can humor with a paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox simple to say is that i have two people to remember one word i told you say , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
a famous baker .  (500)
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot;  (501)
and over time , i found back you ask , &quot; remember what i call before you remember that term ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what word ? &quot;  (503)
being told is 人名 baker people remember that term potential as far as not being told a baker that person .  (504)
same word cause different memories .  (505)
why is it ?  (506)
because 人名 baker no special meaning  (507)
couldn &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any .  (508)
but as a baker normally nouns that we all know baker &apos;s ?  (509)
baker with funny white cap .  (510)
they hand and flour .  (511)
they came home from work with a 扑鼻 toast .  (512)
maybe some people have a friend &apos;s baker  (513)
we first hear this word , immediately generates all kinds of ways that we can make in after a while , can still remember .  (514)
this precise memory 两千五百年 skills in front of the ancient greeks had it .  (515)
and call it palace memory .  (516)
this invention skills , there &apos;s a process called simonides following the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he was being asked to do the performing guest because in the &apos; cool fancy party standards isn &apos;t please d. j. to beat reduction , but please poet ode to come .  (518)
he stood up and put out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died .  (519)
not all death all of them were to come down on 面目全非  (520)
nobody said to them what are some people who don &apos;t like to tell who sat where  (521)
that causes the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬  (522)
and then reinforce the whole thing tragedy colors .  (523)
simonides as standing outside the rubble only survivors close your eyes thrust upon realizing in his mind his eyes appeared all 宾客 are sitting .  (524)
he would hold hands are relative to the site to bring their loved ones around .  (525)
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 thing about all of you have probably guessed . it &apos;s no matter how much we don &apos;t remember to name phone number or colleagues every instructions that we all have very keen visual or spatial memory capacity .  (526)
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap me just tell the story of the top 10 words simonides should not many people will remember .  (527)
but i bet , if i show you now back down in the foyer . sat will speak brown on 骏马 who is that you see , i just saying .  (528)
this advice from 两千多年 ago latin earliest scholars memory .  (529)
so this phrase principles of what is this ?  (530)
suppose you were invited to stand on the ted stage speech center , and you want to finish 脱稿 as 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome tedx talk on average , he would do 霸气 step one and you want .  (531)
you want to do is to imagine yourself standing in front home  (532)
and imagine working out with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster ed mr. sitting on the back .  (534)
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook  (535)
and then you head comes 小甜甜 britney looks like , you &apos;ll remember to talk about britney that little story .  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is you spent a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association  (537)
this is presenting rome home talk reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just going to just reciting flat 添麻烦 but remember , one by one topic .  (538)
it &apos;s the theme &quot; phrases &quot; quote from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is 古时候 people talk about rhetorical , or will use into space .  (540)
&quot; phrases first &quot; means your memory 第一层 palace .  (541)
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that up a lot of interest .  (542)
and then i went to more memory .  (543)
i started a 萌发 more detailed it that my memory rodeo culture .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory process is very boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there .  (547)
the most exciting moment don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing !  (549)
i know those guys head is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t be seen as 外人  (550)
i realized that if i really think about these things have to have to experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes and try something memory .  (552)
behind each little poem .  (553)
back in my back 跳蚤市场 bought 年鉴 old people in the names .  (554)
i was surprised to find it very 带劲  (555)
don &apos;t want to try and fundamental surprise  (556)
interesting is actually goal is not going to train improve memory  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working build those completely comical myth is better 胡乱 unforgettable images .  (558)
and it became my joy .  (559)
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a whole 镜面 护目镜 耳塞 a hot black left two little holes memory , because the biggest enemies are dispersed attention .  (561)
and i &apos;m reporting back again a year ago 竞 赛场 on that .  (562)
i also want to urge is signed up for that as engagement properties news experiment .  (563)
when i thought to be in the 前言 调侃 it yourself .  (564)
the problem is experiment finally got unexpected consequences  (565)
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or shopping alone is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important .  (567)
these are little usual tricks  (568)
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles .  (569)
don &apos;t have to really build palace or laying down memories of cards 几副 order you can also totally from understanding brains gain some benefits of principles .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 facts is not .  (571)
powerful memory is can acquire .  (572)
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember  (573)
engaged , can remember  (574)
memory palace or that memory skills are just 捷径 .  (575)
and they really are deemed 捷径  (576)
this method works is because it forces you thinking .  (577)
it forces you to go deeper , to want more you focus most people don &apos;t normally painless to this training .  (578)
actually 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist .  (579)
this is what we have to remember things .  (580)
by having experiences that i found that our bodies 潜藏 with an amazing memory capacity .  (581)
but if you want to live memorable do is to remember that often memory .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
who la lee duke 沃斯 : success willpower keys ?  (584)
on my 27th , i resigned as a very challenging career -- business management , counseling and turned into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i came to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math .  (586)
and as other teachers , i &apos;ll give students do little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
when these 试卷 homework and open up , and then i calculate their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq of ups , is not my best and the worst students , the only difference between .  (590)
some in the 课业 performance good students don &apos;t have very high iq score on .  (591)
some pretty smart kid , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 .  (592)
and this triggered my thinking .  (593)
of course , students in seven grade need to learn that there is hard , like rates , small number of 四边形 area , parallel computation .  (594)
but the concept is completely can be controlled , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , and they would spend time and effort .  (595)
after a few years later , i got a lesson that in terms of education , we need to learn from the dynamic perspective and psychological angle to student learning behavior , and have a more profound understanding .  (596)
in education systems , we all know , evaluating students high standard is iq , but if in schools and the good life do not much depend on your ability to learn more efficient easy ?  (597)
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids and adults are , in various very challenging circumstances , and in studies of treaties , my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they succeeding ?  (599)
i and my research group to point out 西点 research .  (600)
we try to predict what tolerance fellow to be elected to live military training , which will be tolerated zone out .  (601)
before we went to see the national together words , race also try to predict what kids can level-up at the end game .  (602)
our research , working in hostile environment work , just go in teacher , ask them to decide what a teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 them , and those who can really quickly increased student learning grades .  (603)
we work with 私企 , to ask them what they could sell to work .  (604)
what can earn most ?  (605)
in all these different context , a character , no one out of this feature in a very large extent predicted success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
it &apos;s not nice appearance , robust , . it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and persist .  (610)
tenacity is have perpetual 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is you about the future , with every day is not just for a week or a month , but a few decades effort and struggle for their dream a reality .  (612)
tenacity is put life as a marathon and it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower .  (614)
i was on 千名 初中生 conducted about willpower survey of waiting for a year , and more , to see what ultimately graduate students can .  (615)
everything is not just in 西点 point or in the competition to build the words that willpower . in schools is also true , especially for those 徘徊 dropout on the edge of the kids .  (616)
for my own self , about willpower me the most astonishing thing is heading for willpower , we develop willpower , cognitive science , in the understanding that was how poor .  (617)
every single parents and teachers have to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do to teach kids to really work ethic ?  (619)
and what they move the long-term is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t allow you to gritty heart .  (622)
our data suggests that very clearly , there are many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , according to our data rates , usually willpower with other factors , and off , even with the brilliance measures run counter .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard nurture in kids qualities tough most effective called &quot; exponential growth mindset . &quot;  (625)
stanford 卡洛杜 william chris suggested , he had an idea that people &apos;s ability to learn , it can change alongside your level and to change .  (626)
professor 杜威克 means , when kids learn reading and knowledge about brains and its facing challenges , what was happening and growing situation , after they fail more easily keep going , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure .  (627)
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
i decided to close my comments on this , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
this is the elephant in the face of work .  (631)
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas , and most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to make their practice .  (632)
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in again and again .  (633)
in other words , we only have their own to become more productive willpower make our kids to become more productive willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
steve titus : 泽维尔 dimension into that local culture .  (636)
as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , will also think about architecture , with their environment , and with the buildings , around the environment , which is the relationship between tradition .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples based on this idea .  (638)
these two examples are emerging in a country , in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
this one , two cases have in common is that design solutions final shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping malls .  (641)
this was my team and i get the same example , we were asked to design this way .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
looking at the same kind of style of architecture -- after the city has a lot of this kind of building -- we discovered these buildings , the most important three questions .  (644)
first , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , people are not the big brands .  (645)
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because the roads are built outside of glass , this design would be trapped inside heat in architecture , it causes we need a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this city climate is quite 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. .  (647)
the third problem is the building looks like a relationship between africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t .  (648)
for a culture and abundance 底蕴 cities , it &apos;s called people disappointed .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , when i was a local 集贸市场 deeply . mesmerized . every day , hundreds of people gathered also in open-air architectural environments , from 小商贩 hands and buy all want goods .  (650)
this is consistent with my ideas , is in outdoor public setting create campaigns ideas .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the question is , how can we in such a contemporary architecture 多层 贯彻 of these ideas ?  (653)
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , are we designing doesn &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building back and forth on the streets , two years ago in parallel 几百米 are no little can connected .  (655)
so we need to do is we use all of this very building a portal , put those two road linked it up .  (656)
we then through a gradient of 庭 design , created an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 .  (657)
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little idea marketplace . each layer of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same .  (658)
i think another problem is , how buildings outside walls patterns ?  (659)
and i really wanted to find a design for decoration , to local environment .  (660)
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole , made out of cement to use a controlled by the way , get outside of light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we went from ethiopia women beautiful patterns in traditional dress got inspiration .  (662)
these forms that contains a geometry of texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls .  (663)
we were outside walls &apos;s using these small 预制 material , these windows to let light and air to control our way into the building .  (664)
in order to do this point , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use inside , light source in the entire building up at night .  (665)
these ideas , but we don &apos;t start building touch people , they react to things like , &quot; this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all recognize , this design solutions than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop .  (667)
and this outer wall design , a ton of lowering cost , not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use the air handling so much to control the temperature .  (668)
and eventually , we also save a part of the budget .  (669)
builds stage of the first question is , how do we ensure that building to electricity on the question , because cities are almost every day to pull pushing 闸 electricity .  (670)
so we were on the roof of the solar panels .  (671)
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 used to break , to be here in cities , oasis 小憩 for people .  (672)
on the roof of these 游廊 concentrated , by using to collect rainwater , for building clean inside .  (673)
now we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , beginning as well .  (674)
the second example is a city planners tunisia for over a 2000套 apartment buildings and collateral infrastructure .  (675)
do such a large scale project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i only need was really understand the tunisian city , and she also need to understand all kinds of tradition and culture .  (676)
and in the process of my attention to be a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a structure , over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure , there are 12 , the doors through 相互之间 is almost straight path connected .  (677)
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets , will large areas divide 12 primary small region in size and all the characteristics we kind of in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning .  (678)
in these blocks planning basis , referenced mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , shifted started model .  (679)
the last step is to consider a specific areas in the design of the building , apartment these kind of a cubicle , is that this poses a fundamental planning components .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is the best towards ?  (681)
the answer is , can use to 南北朝 house on either 南北 temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we achieve this pattern , and all the apartments have perfect facing .  (683)
this is our design effect , as an arab town , combined with style , european style residential together .  (684)
some of the building areas with a garden , and walk around on the ground sidewalks to connect intact .  (685)
and she &apos;s satisfying local management agency needs , 上层建筑 population density of the population density and higher than high .  (686)
and she would satisfy us right out even between entry 通性 demand .  (687)
this is the roof of the project i 得意 part , which is like these will be building up space and back to the community .  (688)
the community can climb roof , each type poke somebody talk about god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , jump back and forth between or in architecture .  (689)
these two examples of some common , in the design process took the same way .  (690)
again , they are emerging in cities , you can see the little 拔地而起 intuitive buildings .  (691)
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building at the same speed .  (692)
for this reason , i think about the design of buildings in between , the more important , which , find enough cheap and simple solution , to increase and promote the local people and urban environments relationship , and can make people good close to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i want to tell you about trust , people said about the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in reality society has become a cliche .  (697)
i think that there are three things .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus .  (699)
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is task : we should rebuild 信任感 .  (701)
i think people to this proposition , purpose and missions that are wrong .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , mission purpose and a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is proposition : why people believe in 信任感 down ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think that &apos;s really 信任感 down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways maybe is increasing .  (706)
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls , poll should be thought 信任感 in decline come in .  (708)
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this view .  (709)
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe it &apos;s mostly journalists and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and 20 years ago is been highly trust people like judges , and the nurse , still get altitude of trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in social 居中 on these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
polls records and of course , is that some people view .  (714)
or you can record polls ?  (715)
but that &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;ll say anything .  (716)
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ?  (717)
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
you trust sell fish ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart against asked .  (722)
when you understand that question , what would you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot;  (723)
a very rational answer .  (724)
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways to seek trust .  (725)
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the official administration , etc . , people will be types .  (726)
for example , i would say i certainly believe in an elementary school teacher i know how to teach students reading . but i don &apos;t believe that she can prescribe bus .  (727)
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers .  (728)
i might believe that i love drinking friend &apos;s friends chatting . but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them , he &apos;s a secret to living people .  (729)
it &apos;s that simple .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , say there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 , so why polls , we all want 信任感 糊涂 , put more conceptual ?  (731)
i think poll was a very bad measure 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to consider 信任感 poor judgment .  (732)
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ?  (733)
its purpose is we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think that it was ridiculous .  (735)
this is not i thought that purpose .  (736)
i would say , for people should be trusted to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people .  (737)
in fact , i said it was trying not to trust not trusted people .  (738)
for example , who put themselves to earn that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money to roll out 麦道 夫 sir , i think people who say that , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s too easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
wise to trust and wise trust to choose not to be true purpose .  (741)
so somebody says , well , ok , this is not the most important not to trust , but reliability credibility ?  (742)
that means to determine whether someone in some ways trustworthy .  (743)
i think the need to make decisions about 3 .  (744)
they want to see whether or not ? allows you to do ? honest whether reliable ?  (745)
if we think someone &apos;s allows you to , in his own area is . it allows you to be honest reliable . we have reason to believe they , because they &apos;re reliable .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not they were trying to help me to send messages , because they forget it .  (748)
i got some very confident friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident .  (749)
of course , i &apos;m glad that allows you to my friends were reliable , and not is not very honest .  (750)
perhaps there , i haven &apos;t discovered .  (751)
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation reliability .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do .  (754)
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions in accountability needs institutions , whether they achieve professional standards or official demand on these making it easier for us to determine whether there &apos;s credibility .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that .  (757)
i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 chat , she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a than 手续 接生 a children &apos;s hard to ! &quot;  (758)
in our lives , our public institutions lives , we found a lot of questions . the institution in accountability for these rules to protect his reputation as can be trusted by institutions have implemented it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
it allows people to focus their jobs , like they 助产士 , let them take time to waste in 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually had this experience .  (761)
about purpose to talk a lot .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy thing . this is the judgment , is rapidly response , an attitude , here are not talking about it .  (763)
and thirdly , about the task .  (764)
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got a tail .  (765)
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust .  (766)
okay , we can do for ourselves .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but what roots closed , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from others .  (770)
you can &apos;t rebuild them for your ideas .  (771)
you need to make people trying to get you any 家信 .  (772)
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people .  (773)
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful , according to let them know that you are trustworthy .  (775)
should do ?  (776)
actually , day in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , often very effective .  (777)
i give you just a simple family business marketing examples .  (778)
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions .  (779)
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me change color is my favorite socks .  (780)
it &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me feel like they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very well be trusted . according to say to yourself , you have confidence .  (783)
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell .  (784)
people are trustworthy and people who is a relationship . we could determine when people &apos;s worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
john 科林 托克斯 : the movies manhood .  (787)
as the father that makes me happy , is able to see themselves loved the movie .  (788)
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (789)
the next few months , she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 .  (791)
and she put themselves dressed like as 仙女 still holding 魔杖 .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll find this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , raising kids , kids are getting immersed in a fantastic complexity of the world .  (794)
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot;  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
this trend is 40 years later today &apos;s popular . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 毛绒绒 and a guy to mimic the enemy to safeguard save a girl .  (797)
you think about this is what movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
this film well there are many different , &quot; with &quot; tracking 仙 绿野 recent years we see the film in all aspects 两三 there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients .  (801)
the monkey &apos;s inside of violence , and this apple .  (802)
but i think if we are tracking 仙 绿野 film , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re prophecy save oz in people .  (803)
use your magic slippers to beat bad 巫婆 military . &quot;  (804)
but that &apos;s not like that .  (805)
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; sex and unique enshrined in most image of heroic role , intelligence , even bad are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , along with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized that point , when that happens there are different .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
and three .  (809)
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him at together .  (810)
but as home for a second child , his care suddenly sort of a lot .  (811)
and he would run into in , and then the mystery is like a little duck were seen as duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , but he clearly i became obsessed with this .  (812)
i &apos;m curious he liked this film reasons .  (813)
a subject that film out of courage , tenacity and faithful ?  (814)
and also 卢克 joins the army facts about overthrowing a government ?  (815)
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is how to win ?  (817)
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders .  (818)
i hope to their children in this environment -- oz world -- up , and not to beat up to the world , the world -- this was a very very close to reality .  (819)
why do we show kids movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ?  (820)
about men &apos;s violence against women on film , there are many brilliant article analysis , you should go . good writing .  (821)
a lot to affect boy , i read the article , not so much .  (822)
and my own experience for me , the princess 从莱娅 surrounds environment guide me not getting experience in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; men and women of 混居 . &quot;  (823)
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the movie , it has to be 演员表 emergence , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i finished mission , winning 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be standing here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
these films focus on the beat the bad guys get rewarded , not so much time dealing with other relationships and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you ought to be wearing 战袍 .  (829)
of course , as an example of , and i &apos;ll in front of you for disney princess were defense .  (830)
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not expect these films audience .  (831)
these films had a big all because that &apos;s how we teach girls rebel 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society .  (832)
kids don &apos;t idol can 寻 .  (833)
we also have some amazing women start for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i tell you all recommend this film . now are being shown in .  (836)
you remember the brave legends criticism , &quot; just project ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe it 皮克斯 started doing princess movies . &quot;  (838)
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , these films almost nothing , &quot; by 贝克德 test . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
this test for not known , but today , maybe we can do about them .  (842)
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , and she remembers recorded her and a friend in assessment they saw the movie about content .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)
consider the standard .  (845)
if you are , female characters in movies are talking about ?  (846)
if there &apos;s no conversation , with their common 心上人 talk about content ?  (847)
okay ? thank you .  (848)
thank you very much .  (849)
women have to speak , two , a conversation .  (850)
there was this film . i saw , but we &apos;ve seen in and enjoy movies is very rare .  (851)
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a good quality movie 阿尔戈 . &quot;  (852)
oscar the film , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality .  (853)
but bell doerr test f .  (854)
i think it should not movies . because most plot don &apos;t know you &apos;ve seen , no movies plot of what &apos;s happening in the event has been hijacked 人质 big 使馆 period , men and women are hidden inside .  (855)
we see several scene , the men in place to be profound and full of anxiety conversation . and one girl movie actor , the nice story is the next door said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot;  (856)
this is the hollywood .  (857)
look at statistics .  (858)
the most popular front 2011 100部 movies , how many film has heroine ?  (859)
11部 . not too bad .  (860)
just universal picked congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , this is a good ratio .  (861)
and the percentage of just higher and the percentage of you will get shock .  (862)
last year , new york times published a paper done by government .  (863)
here &apos;s the content .  (864)
in the united states every five women who &apos;s ever met 性骚扰 .  (865)
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s popular entertainment had wrong .  (866)
i don &apos;t think this is due to film children .  (867)
i even think porn music and movie with this direct doesn &apos;t matter , but certainly where wrong . when i hear the statistics , i was thinking about 性骚扰 , population is so much .  (868)
who were they ? how they were teaching them ?  (869)
they learned leaks ?  (870)

i don &apos;t know his name , but i knew his story .  (892)
he lived in somalia in a small village  (893)
it &apos;s very 加迪休 village from the capital .  (894)
this little village , because it &apos;s been so drought 食不果腹 poor people .  (895)
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the somali capital &apos;s 加迪休 , is the largest cities .  (896)
he just arrived , no , no , no prospects opportunities .  (897)
and only lived in a tent that &apos;s 加迪休 town in the country .  (898)
and last year , and there &apos;s nothing .  (899)
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch .  (900)
he discovered a bunch of people have vitality and he &apos;s got rest .  (901)
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes can give their own native to send money .  (902)
somebody gives he introduced a young girl .  (903)
and they did .  (904)
he started new life .  (905)
he lives have goals .  (906)
&apos;s 加迪休 in one day in the sky 碧蓝 happened a car bombing .  (907)
this cities with dreams town boy is the suicide bombers , and it did help dynamic people are &quot; for youth &quot; party , an al qaeda connected with a terrorist organization .  (908)
this little boy just wanted to go through the city why through his story was a suicide attack for the end ?  (909)
he actually wait .  (910)
he was an opportunity for waiting his turn on a waiting for the future can move road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road .  (911)
this is going to be like him waiting 成年期 from the first encounter .  (912)
and he &apos;s stories are repeated in the world with different downtown .  (913)
this is a story about being taken power , urban youth unemployment story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots , they started to get 成年期 outside .  (914)
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means job opportunities , wealth , but people didn &apos;t enjoy where they live in cities .  (915)
more , are in youth unemployment stand on top .  (916)
by 2030 , five people living in cities , which has three under 18 belong to the crowd .  (917)
if we in urban development , not to young people think , of course , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and the gang 雷池 will be the future of cities .  (918)
i was born in cities , more 加迪休 70 percent of people in unemployment .  (919)
70 percent no job , no reading books .  (920)
basically do nothing  (921)
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital home that i was born in the hospital .  (922)
i remember standing that are full of play eye hospital in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it be ?  (923)
if i have to get at the same waiting 成年期 ?  (924)
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ?  (925)
so i did say no answers .  (926)
i came last month &apos;s 加迪休 reason is actually to try an obsession with business leadership learn summit  (927)
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership  (928)
we sat down to working together to solve the problem facing the largest cities .  (929)
one in the room called aden young people .  (930)
he &apos;s 加迪休 at the university and graduated .  (931)
there was no job nothing .  (932)
i remember i told him because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , &quot; it was very frustrated youth party &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want recruiting people .  (933)
those people that look like this .  (934)
but his story , there &apos;s another version  (935)
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and the biggest obstacle was roads  (936)
23 years of civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , it actually became the easy-to-use tools .  (937)
aden found opportunities and grab on it .  (938)
he drove a motorcycle company .  (939)
started cab motorcycle rent for local people who buy motorcycle  (940)
in 亲朋好友 help , he bought 10辆 he eventually dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆  (941)
he &apos;s story about how different ?  (942)
what makes the difference ?  (943)
i believe is his and find opportunities to grasp opportunity ability .  (944)
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is waiting 成年期 with the most effective tool .  (945)
he drove young people become they kept 60-minute searching for economic opportunity makers  (946)
you can train young them into entrepreneurs .  (947)
i want to tell you about a man who had to me that i have a meeting he called doctor-heroes mohamoud is a 名花 businesses .  (948)
he helped me during training in business summit part of the young people how to grow them how to create a cultural entrepreneurial innovation .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; you see the flowers , what is it ? &quot; born in civil wars period for many people they answer would be , &quot; never seen before . &quot;  (950)
so , from found opportunities in doctor-heroes  (951)
he created an 园林 greening and design and the company .  (952)
he &apos;s 加迪休 go out on a piece of agriculture , and he started planting tulip 百合花 and he said that can have a flower &apos;s hostile 加迪休 climate .  (953)
and he started to build 家庭式 wedding send the flower garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s busy trying to build 加迪休 22年 for the first park citizens .  (954)
in today &apos;s 加迪休 is no park citizens .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for family , young people together to be here as he said , to feel rose 花香 and enlightenment .  (956)
by the way down , he can &apos;t grow rose and the reason is because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire the young so in that room , the doctor-heroes attend to this very deeply affected young people .  (958)
they don &apos;t want to be entrepreneurial .  (959)
they thought for civil society organizations work for government work , but in this case , he innovation for those people very big impact .  (960)
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city .  (961)
he makes them believe they can also be entrepreneurs can be changing the world .  (962)
and the day before , they came up with novel solutions to solve this cities now some of the most intractable problems .  (963)
they came up with a business solution to local problems .  (964)
so inspired to create young corporate culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business .  (966)
they provide for young people need for resources they need to provide support and helping them from idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for urban development .  (967)
for me , entrepreneurship is not only commercial pressing  (968)
it involves creating social impact .  (969)
not sells flowers on doctor-heroes  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took when it , it will create a truly change people in this city .  (972)
side street aden hire him for a cab also help strengthen the motorcycle  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to escape from waiting to escape from 成年期 unfortunate .  (974)
these young entrepreneurs for all of them have a profound impact cities .  (975)
so my suggestion is that move more young people become entrepreneurs inward development nurturing their creative spirit that will have more flowers and peace park story begins , rather than the car bomb and wait 成年期 story .  (976)
thank you .  (977)
薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read the chinese word for !  (978)
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , my most precious memory is one of my mom for shows the chinese word for the beauty of form of care .  (979)
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language .  (980)
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to china as 高不可攀 wall .  (981)
the last few years , i kept thinking about how we can tackle this wall , for those who want to understand and enjoy it complicated language elegant , where people can do this .  (982)
i started thinking , how to create a new and fast , to help the chinese word for learning .  (983)
from five up , i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book .  (984)
fifteen years time , i &apos;m learning new the chinese word for every day .  (985)
because we are only five minutes , preferably something more time with a simple faster way of learning .  (986)
a chinese scholar , the chinese word for 二万个 recognize .  (987)
you just need to recognize the chinese word for a thousand , can read simple literature .  (988)

this is a tree .  (996)
&quot; carpenter . &quot;  (997)
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot;  (998)
&quot; day . &quot;  (999)
&quot; months . &quot;  (1000)
&quot; 門 &quot; signs like wild about comfort pair of cars on the door .  (1001)
i call this eight words for basic words .  (1002)
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words .  (1003)
&quot; a man . &quot;  (1004)
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot;  (1005)
a phrase , two , three people from artifacts for public .  (1006)
if somebody open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot;  (1007)
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; the world , people were stuck .  (1008)
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about getting stuck in the whale belly .  (1009)
tree . &quot; is &quot; carpenter &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot;  (1010)
three trees together , is &quot; forests . &quot;  (1011)
take a piece of wood on trees , and we have &quot; basic . &quot;  (1012)
take a 张嘴 under a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot;  (1013)
remember to very easy , because a will speak trees are very 呆傻 things .  (1014)
remember &quot; fire ? &quot;  (1015)
&quot; 两团 fire &quot; together , it becomes very &quot; hot . &quot;  (1016)
&quot; 三团 fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much .  (1017)
to put the fire &apos;s two trees , will &quot; burn &quot; .  (1018)
for us , everything from the sun &apos;s life .  (1019)
two together , the sun is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around .  (1020)
the sun three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot;  (1021)
when the sun shines together and the moon , which is &quot; light . &quot;  (1022)
one day after a night was , &quot; tomorrow . &quot;  (1023)
from the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; &quot; 旦 .  (1024)
&quot; a door . &quot; in the door put in a piece of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot;  (1025)
take a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot;  (1026)
&quot; bang &quot; -- boom , someone at home ?  (1027)
this man was even outside , &quot; &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; escape .  (1028)
the left , we have a woman .  (1029)
two women together , maybe have debate .  (1030)
three women together , be careful , is &quot; and &quot; 姦 .  (1031)
we &apos;ve learned about the chinese word for 30 .  (1032)
and through this way , this basic eight words can secondary up into 32 the chinese word for .  (1033)
the next eight of the chinese word for it will secondary out the chinese word for another 32 .  (1034)
so , you can really easy to learn , that the chinese word for hundreds of equivalent of china was eight children of chinese language .  (1035)
learning over those words later , we started learning how to build a phrase .  (1036)
like , &quot; the mountain . &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcano . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot;  (1037)
we know that japan is the sun rises place .  (1038)
and here the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china .  (1039)
so the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot;  (1040)
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; man , we get ?  (1041)
&quot; the japanese . &quot;  (1042)
the words are stacking up and down the mountain , those two together .  (1043)
in the ancient chinese , which means 流亡 , because chinese clothes 政敌 to put in the mountain .  (1044)
nowadays , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go away . &quot;  (1045)
&quot; and &quot; a word tell you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot;  (1046)
this slide reminds me , to finish up , and walking down the table . thank you .  (1047)
