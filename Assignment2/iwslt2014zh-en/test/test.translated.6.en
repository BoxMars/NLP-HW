meg jay : why was 20 , 30 is not new . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first patient to mental therapy . 
when i was a clinical psychologist in berkeley university read the ph . d students . 
she &apos;s a called alex 26 women . 
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the back of my office to just sit on the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she came to me about men problem . 
when i heard this , and i disengaged . 
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to tell me about boys . 
i think i can deal with this thing . 
but i can &apos;t do that . 
alex in every meeting , all that funny story 点点 so to me , and on the head of the time is a very , very easy thing . 
alex would say , &quot; this is a new the , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later , we have to have children later , even after death is to have . 
and i like alex 二十几岁 like except time out of nothing . 
but not too long , i started to push me on that 催 alex love life . 
i refuse . 
i said , &quot; yes , she &apos;s now on a date , and she &apos;s the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend energy is in the best time before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists said , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment . 
and in that moment , i learned the 30 二十岁 is not new . 
yes , more people than ever 安顿 later on , but it doesn &apos;t mean that 二十几岁 alex between , this is her 低谷 development . 
this 二十几岁 alex to develop a good time , and we sat spoil it . 
and i realized that this oversight &quot; kindness &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for love , alex and her life 二十几岁 around for people with the family . 
now , the united states have 二十几岁 5千万 about people . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or if you think about 100 percent said that nobody can 二十几岁 experience this stage in case after adults period . 
if you &apos;re a 二十几岁 , raise your hand . 
i really wanted to see here , 一些二十几岁 people . 
that &apos;s great ! you are awesome . 
if you 二十几岁 and the people who work , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you lost 二十几岁 because people and o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome 二十几岁 , who is very important . 
it &apos;s not my point of view . that &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime 80 percent of the most important moment happened in 35 years old . 
that means every 10 to your life would be the kind of experience with , &quot; it ! &quot; moment that happened in one of eight 中旬 30 . 
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money , you will make a very big impact . 
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 终生 and before that , or partner 同居 married , on a date . 
we know in your brain 二十几岁 adults period when to fit to the second is the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own , what is now change its time . 
we know , other than life 二十岁 stage personality the biggest change , and we also know that women have reproduction in the summit 28 years old , after 35 years old , and that &apos;s kind of hard to do . 
so this between 二十几岁 your is tell your own body has the choice , and the future . 
so when we say children development , five years ago , we all know the language and admiration brain development is the critical period . 
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact time period . 
but we hear a few is have something called adults , and we developed this stage is 二十岁 adults development critical period . 
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard . 
时间表 adult newspaper in describing the change . 
researchers have 二十几岁 called extend adolescence . 
journalist 二十几岁 for people to stupid , like , &quot; names , &quot; and &quot; the adult children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , we &apos;ve actually is the most important decades 期中 adults a doesn &apos;t matter . 
伯恩斯 伦纳德 -- i said , if you want to do a thing , you need a plan and not enough time . 
this is not right ? 
so , when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ? 
nothing happens . 
you take that guy urgency , and worked , but nothing happened . 
and everybody says , &quot; in 30 just before i started my career , no problem . &quot; this one . 
but then they said , &quot; i start the 二十岁 fast , but i didn &apos;t have to . 
i graduated day best 写写 my résumé . &quot; 
and they start 二十几岁 : &quot; when date as seat in play games . 
you &apos;re running around , and , in one , but music is about 30 to stop a off for a start , you sit down . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i married my husband and i think the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently &quot; chair &quot; . &quot; 
二十几岁 here where people ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
well , that sounds that may seem a little bit 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , very high currency here . 
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short period of time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
there &apos;s a lot of these things are not compatible , and as research suggests that started 三十几岁 on this stage and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big . 
in a thousand years later , middle-aged crisis is not could buy a red open buggy . 
is that our profession doesn &apos;t want to . 
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or can &apos;t give their kids a people . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people what to do best . 
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do . 
this is a story about a name &apos;s emma women story . 
25 emma , she came to my office with her , because , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art , or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent do at the . 
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she worked 脾气 show it more and more than my boyfriend live together . 
and no matter how difficult 二十几岁 her , she used lives more difficult . 
and when she was meeting , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walks in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took a morning fill her to people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this graph ... &quot; &quot; the blank behind . 
she 歇斯底里 close to the looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot; 
now , i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i &apos;ll . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment . 
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , and i &apos;m not going to have decided to emma that 10 years that we do it . 
so in the next weeks and months , i told the emma in three 二十几岁 each person , both men and women , should have heard about things . 
first of all , i told emma forget her identity crisis and started to accumulate identity capital . 
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value . 
what you do this for what it was like to think of investment . 
i didn &apos;t know emma career , the future , and nobody knows the future of my own work , but i know that these : identity capital would get to more identity capital . 
this is take that one multinational career , that one in and you want to step up to the time . 
i &apos;m not 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the idea that you can &apos;t name to explore . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trial all work and get them to count . 
secondly , i told emma city tribes overestimate . 
the new capital , the new can almost always about out from the inside of the people at the community . 
new things from what we call the connection to the weak , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friend . 
yes , about half the people who never 二十几岁 jobs , or not full employment . 
but it &apos;s not about half the connection is weak , and put yourself in the way that a group . 
half of the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connect to your neighbor boss is you get that one never 张贴 work by the way . 
it &apos;s not about cheating . this is how information out of science . 
and finally , emma people don &apos;t believe that a family , but we can choose to friends . 
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as people , very quickly 一个二十几岁 emma with 结伴 somebody &apos;s going to create a family , selected for her family . 
i told emma choice family time is now . 
you might think 30 is an even more than 20 , 25 better security , the next time , and i agreed . 
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , manage your 同居 and your sleep , or people don &apos;t call progress . 
in the best and kung fu &apos;s marriage is married time before , which means to be treated with love as rich work like that . 
choice family is conscious choices you want to people , and that &apos;s not just make things like success or and choose the person you waste your time . 
that emma and how ? 
well , we made it into the address thin , and she found her an old roommate , a family in another art museum in a job . 
that faint in there to help her a job . 
that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons . 
now , the past five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and her consciously chose a people get married . 
she loved her new career , she in love with his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now 联系人 emergence , not to be a big fence 的卡 . &quot; pieces . 
emma story to this thing sounds very simple , but this is my favorite 二十几岁 and the reason why people work . 
it &apos;s so easy to help them . 
people like 二十几岁 just leave los angeles international airport destination somewhere flights in the west . 
take off , and the change is a little further and further in alaska in fiji difference . 
likewise , even at 21 or 29岁 is 25 , a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can even 对接 down a few generations is a very big impact . 
and to give a every worth spreading 二十几岁 people you know the idea . 
and it &apos;s what i learned to say to alex as simple . 
you don &apos;t know they don &apos;t do or don &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re going to your life . 
thank you . 
computer : into 李镇河 李镇河 : &quot; real world , &quot; infinite imagination to you . 
look at the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , we still have a virtual world with the real world . the gap between the virtual world , in our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap in them , and will continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is less than one millimeter , is to touchscreen glass so thin , and it &apos;s a computer all the people . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual and the boundaries between reality to great ? 
so i started to try this crazy idea . 
i first build this tool , it can go digital space , if you take a pen that using force on the screen , and this is a pen pen by going into a little pixels of virtual worlds . 
designers directly in three-dimensional space to their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery . 
so , the tools to break between the virtual and real world of boundaries . 
but we are in the hands out . 
how can we reach into and digital information to interactions , and use our flexible hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to the top of a small space move into the work of numbers . 
because in reality space window and file in a particular location , pick they become like shelves from a book , and so easily . 
and you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands stretched or by various model . 
in this example that we &apos;re now entering the digital world . 
but how can transform it to make the role of the digital information into our world ? 
in the room that many people have online shopping 退货 and experience . 
but now than you don &apos;t worry about . 
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 online . 
this is the system , and our body geometry , after we drive through a head of or look at that show us how the situation . 
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how to make the space that we see a transformation pixels to actually get to touch , feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i had my mentor 石井裕 雷米 my partner , steve , the common make it a &quot; matter a little pixels . &quot; 
in this case , this is our 磁体 spherical shape , like in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer , this object and people will move into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place . 
so how do we eliminate gravity , is about the role of a ball , and driven by magnetically levitated , mechanical sense , technology and on a ball together to control movement . 
and for this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , the movement of the people in the world of matter that can be recorded , back and forever , keep . 
so , it can be remote 编排 dance , and actually teach , michael jordan , 扣篮 famous over and over again , if you can actually being repeated itself . 
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , is this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force . 
more exciting , it &apos;s not something that is to the computer into a real stuff , but programming world to imagine , even to change our everyday physical activity . 
and as you can see , digital information will not put things that give us , but to start working on us directly to become part of our physical environment , not cut our connection with the real world . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; border &quot; from the beginning , if we can get the rest of the border , this is our enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
&apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned over two years in china 湖南 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned that in china 湖南 体操 two years . 
when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 体校 转学 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 体校 转学 , all free . 
my mother said , &quot; no , the tiger . &quot; 
my parents , and i hope they grow elephants as parents and engineers . i hope i , as they grow elephants and engineers . 
文革 as survivors , they only get -- think happiness is a reliable way 高薪 security . 
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter . 
but i dream is to be 黄梅戏 actor . 
that &apos;s my premise playing the piano . 
to start from little 戏曲 actor to actor 身段 kung fu 戏曲 , started to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i want to do everything 黄梅戏 to go to school . 
even write 戏校 principal and a radio host . 
but don &apos;t have a big people love that idea . 
not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious . 
they only 小伙伴 my for me , but they also a child , and i like powerless . 
was 15 , i know that i &apos;m going to learn how to play has age too big . 
my dream is no longer going to do . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ah ! my god . 
i decided to dark for another mission for themselves . 
no one around 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learned from the book . 
so the 三毛 全集 南怀瑾 &quot; and &quot; the history of the experience -- i 1995 , to the united states in the united states , what i first read a book ? 
of course , is 禁书 china . 
the earth , &quot; tell the story of farmers is china . 
real to be propaganda . okay . 
bible interesting , but also very strange . 
他日 and talk about the topic . 
the ten commandments , but the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my mind a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; not equal and more than &quot; submission . &quot; 
it &apos;s become my climb 负罪感 儒家 out of the tools i climb up , it becomes 儒家 负罪感 tools , and i rebuild the relationship with their parents . 
to a new culture and environment for reading habits , i compared to a new culture and environment for me to read a habit . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from small to large use world map . 
i had never realized , it doesn &apos;t necessarily need to china in the middle of a world map . 
this map , with a view . 
compare reading is not new . 
it &apos;s academia , the standard approach . 
even 比较文学 , compare that to be religious . 比较文学 field of religion , even become specialized research . 
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding of the comparison . let academics control for a project has a full understanding . 
i read about the , if you have to work with , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ? 
so i started putting a book about to read . 
they can be about the same events different parties , they can be about the same event , two different parties , or a shared experience friends . 
jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : social responsibility and desire , fear -- interesting . 
if you know , the book , and you like to compare the two language . it &apos;s very interesting . 
so thomas 默 . the translator , &quot; &quot; 庄子 阿伦 , the moral approaching the watts . people often say , &quot; we always have lost , i was one that we can bring to it . 
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning , but it &apos;s called &quot; fast joy , &quot; well ... 
chinese bride , &quot; the literal meaning word for &quot; it &apos;s new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
books have become 今人 lack of communication , and an amazing portal , books , and has become 今人 lack of communication , an amazing . 
and let me don &apos;t think alone helpless . 
compared to other people &apos;s suffering 破灭 dream , not what other people &apos;s suffering . than , not what 破灭 dreams . 
i started to realize that it &apos;s not the only purpose dream , i started to realize that dream come true , not the only purpose . 
it &apos;s the most important purpose to touch , let &apos;s dream sources of places where the source , passion , happiness , the source . 
even a broken 灭 dreams can also make your experiencing that touch . 
because the book , i &apos;m happy to this , to live life of purpose and meaning , to become clear , in most of the time . 
and always wish to you at any age . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
帕鲁尔 de 颂歌 塞加尔 : envy . 
i was eight , class in new to a woman . she &apos;s compelling , like all new girls to that . 
she &apos;s a lot of 秀发 光泽 put a cute little 文具盒 specialize in a name that week , the capital that no one can than spell . 
that year , i was the people were envy until i want to make the evil . 
one day after from school , i actually 逗留 and leave it to the second night , i &apos;ve been silently sit on the toilet 
and it &apos;s a 出动 , i was to go from a classroom teachers table scores for it . 
and i -- a win by stopping . 
and i change my opponents scores only is it a little bit , take some a 降级 wait . 
well , it &apos;s all a 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 抽屉 册子 , etc . , but some other students and high score to awfully ! 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all the way , but not and creativity 
i gave everyone in the line of a 等分 and myself in this because i &apos;ve got to be completely some more . 
i still didn &apos;t understand my behavior . 
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out . 
i don &apos;t know why they tasted really good to do that . 
i was feeling great . 
i don &apos;t understand why i had never been found 
i mean , this thing to do so . 
i hasn &apos;t been found . 
but it &apos;s important , why i care about this girl , so in this tiny little girls so at this point in time to spell ? i baffled . 
envy threw me 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that babies are jealous of torture 
also know primate envy , very to envy 知更鸟 blue . 
we know that &apos;s the murder agents mate is the united states . 
but i never read an article research could explain , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; lonely , or are they brutal it . 
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study &quot; envy , &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
actually , i don &apos;t know this is not hyperbole to say , if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;ll have a literary ? 
if not 忠 ocean &apos;s , &quot; there is no odyssey . &quot; 
king , 妒忌 where there is no &quot; 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we have 书单 reading high school , because we &apos;re losing a 喧嚣 &quot; with &quot; are losing &quot; remarkable &quot; is the gates than the sun rises , &quot; are losing 包法利 &quot; lady , &quot; &quot; anna 卡列琳 her . &quot; 
no , no 普鲁斯 jealous . now , i mean , i know people always love 普鲁斯 said all know what , but there &apos;s this thing to say he did it . 
this is his 巨著 年华 water 追忆 &quot; with &quot; 一百周年 this work is to sex envy , including the research and well , we can think of common 竞争性 , which is that i was . 
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we will think about the emotional details , right ? 
we want to 入梦 was a little boys . 
think about a 玛德琳 衣草茶 薰 on the cake . 
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye . 
he &apos;s not how cool compassion 
these books in virginia , the gut 伍尔夫 seems like a cat . 
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it 坚 顽石 as . 
we look at these things together , so why would go on with envy 合拍 . fiction 普鲁斯 and there &apos;s . 
妒忌 desire , up to people , from a firm foundation narrative that is not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s a sensitive nerve to me , because we just think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we get jealous , we &apos;ll make a story . 
tell a story about his people live these stories make us feel bad because they have to make the is we &apos;d suffered . 
the stories we tell ourselves as people to join with the audience know exactly where in the details where 一刀 lethal . right ? 
envy let us all to amateurs 普鲁斯 novelist , and it can understand this . 
all she did make me happy thing will give people happy , maybe it &apos;s happening now . &quot; 
this is he began to their stories and crochet 普鲁斯 , the close-up of every said that he &apos;s a new glamour lover him , &quot; sexual 虐 密室 together in a series of . &quot; 
now we have to admit , 斯万 普鲁斯 and there &apos;s heart infamous two people . 
you know , the 普鲁斯 , if they want to talk to my boyfriend 分手 he &apos;s had to escape from this country . 
but you don &apos;t need so jealous will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
and you &apos;re body 疲 jealous 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , to get . 
envy like ? 
envy love information . 
like detail . 
like a big 光泽 put 秀发 文具盒 cute . 
envy like . 
this is the reason that instagram . 
普鲁斯 academic language , it will 相联 language with envy . 
when the millions of struggling to his envy , and he started standing in front of him to bribe 偷听 lover for these he defend servants &apos; quarters . 
he said , &quot; hey , i know you think this annoying , but it and interpret a 古文 , or watching a monument no two . &quot; 
he said , &quot; this is a real study , scientific knowledge of value . &quot; 
shame , grief , loss : these are the wisdom to 普林斯 there . 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a woman to our pain that we all emotions than a genius , and we &apos;re interested in what could be more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel woman ? 
no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what &apos;s . 
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotion would allow us to see their own hostility ugly trying to heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that wrote that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 visit freud this youth who thought he and his wife disobedience 憔悴 ours so . 
freud think this guy kind of weird because he doesn &apos;t really do focus on what his wife . 
because with his wife &apos;s , you know . 
this is the only guy to have any doubts 缘由 
but he was looking for his wife in some of the unconscious , is utter intend move . 
she &apos;s not funny . or 灿烂 too , she &apos;s mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man is into his wife unconscious behaviors guards . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it &apos;s able to describe this novel training is to look at how we extreme , but it &apos;s not a gets it right . 
well , we get jealous more intense , we &apos;re more often . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something illegal or violence . 
it &apos;s going to become very extreme . 
i thought about eight years old , i admit , but i also think of myself in the news see a story . 
the women 一个52岁 michigan discovered register a false facebook account and used to account for a year sending their malicious news . 
a year . for a year . 
she &apos;s trying to the now 陷害 her before he girlfriend i must admit , i heard it when i was in response she admired 
because , i want to say , you face reality . 
just how creative ! in the wrong place , isn &apos;t it ? 
this comes from fiction . 
a novel , 海史密斯 翠西亚 . 
i was especially loved 海史密斯 writers . 
she &apos;s the brilliant u.s. 文学史 诡 curiosity and a 
for example , tom , universal , her in the most famous character . 
里普利 started to you , or what you want to have , and then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in a basement 应答 his name , and you wear your ring spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but how do we do ? we cannot 里普利 repeat . 
i couldn &apos;t give a huge change the world , one day , even if i want to be able to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in the age of admire 
we live in envy . 
i mean , we are social media good citizens , there &apos;s a trend , isn &apos;t it ? 
we can novel solutions to i don &apos;t know ? 
so we &apos;re going to 学学 novel characters , see where they met puzzles , the thing and don &apos;t know how to do . 
let &apos;s go back to the b 贝克街 221 夏洛克 ask 福尔摩斯 leonardo 
when people think that he would 福尔摩斯 opponent 里亚蒂 professor -- this crime genius 
but i &apos;ve been more like a 阴险 探雷 epidemic 斯垂德 face scottish 福尔摩斯 头子 . he really need to his intelligence , but hate him . 
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this . 
he &apos;s 雷斯 垂 to help , and to hate him in the case of mysterious 侦破 苦闷 again , always story 
we proud of you . &quot; 
in the field and say , no 福尔摩斯 with people who don &apos;t want to hold hands . 
this is the way we see 福尔摩斯 少数几次 when they moved in , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it &apos;s like to envy as a geometry , instead of emotions . 
this minute 雷斯 standing 垂 福尔摩斯 , opposite de 
the next minute they stand in the same . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he was hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if envy is really a geometry , a problem to do with other people about how we choose to do with your question ? 
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent 
we &apos;ll chase . 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when we come to remember , we have novel 慰藉 as 
it has been going on with envy fiction 
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it , please . 
look at it and who are called to : cute , awful 雷斯 垂 de 里普利 tom of the crazy , 普鲁斯 马塞尔 there , there . 
we have so good . 
thank you . 
so , i was in new york 内格尔 : the discovery of garbage . 
i was 10 or so , once and dad went up to camp 阿第伦 that mountain . that &apos;s a place in the new york in the wild . 
it was really good weather . 
the forest searched twinkling lights . 
the sun to shine down , when from 晶莹 like leaves the stained glass . if you don &apos;t feet small way , we think we can completely to this place is the first human . 
we eventually got to our camp . 
it &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes , and i actually found a bad thing . 
in a camp behind , that &apos;s a big , 40 feet 见方 garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , very , very confusing . 
people to camp was too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would 善后 clean for them ? 
and i have this question bedeviled into a more sound bite . the problem . 
who to clean we leave the ? 
but you can put this problem on any place you live in a clean 伊斯坦 . we leave the ? 
in rio clean we leave the ? in paris and london ? 
in new york , here , is sanitation trucks were parked department cleaned up to 11 , we leave the garbage and 000吨 2000吨 day can recycling waste . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know , who are doing this work . 
i take the sanitation trucks were parked in a sense of responsibility . this is what ? 
so i started a about sanitation trucks were parked workers research project . 
i was sitting in the car , along the line , the new york at the office and interview all the sanitation trucks were parked people work here . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not 垃圾车 sitting in , i open 垃圾车 . 
and my own manipulate 扫帚 electric 铲 its street , in the snow . 
that &apos;s an extraordinary privilege 令人叹服 , which is the education process . 
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell . 
there is smell , but it &apos;s not bad . you want that sometimes odor really bad , but very soon , you will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even a few years of working side worker , their body in a week and try to adapt to megatons of garbage . 
so there is at risk . 
with the labor 统计局 report , the sanitation trucks were parked work is one of the most dangerous tasks , and then slowly . i understand why . 
you all day on the road , which are of traffic . 
just to stick with the car , drive than you people often not enough to be careful . 
the sanitation trucks were parked workers , it was too bad . 
and that &apos;s full of the junk that often poisons 毒物 垃圾车 from the comes out , a horrible harm . 
i also learned the cruel and terrible . 
when you &apos;re walking down the sanitation trucks were parked car 路沿 , in a city , you &apos;ll see you recognize the really like the power of nature itself . 
it never is 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like a breathing loop or form . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked . 
i think that it &apos;s called the oriental , funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important labor . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if they clean efficient quickly every day , not the way , the sort of from container itself , it will poison in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we attacked several 和数 century 10 years after the disease , again , there will be to threaten our health . 
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , and we have no space is something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less . 
i don &apos;t use capitalism , here i was just that their relationship . 
and the third reason -- is what i call 经常性 , on average , we need for speed of activity . 
i mean , in the days , and today , we &apos;re so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know there &apos;s a work in teams densest put these things were sitting over there . 
so today i want you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked workers that situation , maybe . they &apos;re called to help them please come to talk about how to build a sustainable people , the city . 
i think their work is very noble . 
they really very day , at the time to work . 
in many cities they wear sanitation trucks were parked suit of work . 
you know , they have to clean the on time . 
they allow us to secure in their work . 
they almost became secure work promise . 
what they keep working traffic safety 忧 without to ourselves , and we don &apos;t worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and waste . anyway , all this work is going to keep stability . 
september 11th , 2001 the day , i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and pull the young , i ran downstairs son . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his 三都 week doing . 
i want to thank him do these work in that particular day , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy . 
his name 保利 times , we have been working together , and become friends . 
i want to believe that 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we as part of this planet , we need to be hard to rebuild . we need to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
normally , we know the city of garbage actually the amount of domestic only three percent . 
this is an amazing data . 
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the garbage , please find a time 致意 to them . 
find a time to say thank you .

okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;m going to tell you about a year , spring in new york are going to do the unexpected . 
it &apos;s called the 冠军赛 memory . 
a few years ago , i reported 科技类 as a journalist to myself , thinking about this race to the geeks who was like , &quot; the bustling 冠军赛 super bowl . &quot; 
a bunch of 屈指可数 men and women and girls from the old some don &apos;t notice personal health 
just look at 奋力 some in a situation that the hundreds of any list of numbers . 
some trying to remember the names of strangers populations . 
within a few minutes , back to the next poem . 
and in the race to the fastest speed , who can remember the sequence 一整副 打乱 card . 
and i thought that &apos;s amazing . 
these people surely 禀 other talents 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
it &apos;s from england called ed to cook , where he had the best training . 
i asked him , &quot; what is ed when you start to realize that they &apos;re memory genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; what i &apos;m not . 
it &apos;s actually my memory . 
the game to every single person will tell you they memory is just generally . 
i &apos;m surprised when &quot; whoa , what i &apos;ve never heard ? &quot; 
we stood outside in the lobby 过人 smart amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
&quot; what ? of course 茫然不解 i ask , why is this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio on how britney 一整副 remember order 打乱 card . 
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
i said , &quot; and i &apos;m not britney , but you can teach taught me ! 
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot; 
and then a very strange journey unfold in front of me 序幕 . 
most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about what &apos;s hidden and other potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he suffers amnesia his memory , like the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember feel amnesia really amazing . 
and he &apos;s a tragedy role , but we can understand through his memory in any way to shape our personality . 
another is an extreme case , i met somebody like this . 
he called peek kim 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the film &quot; rain man &quot; characters in . 
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library , and i think is just fascinating back phone books . 
and i went back home and i read a lot in papers write about memory 两千多年 ago in latin wrote papers until the middle ages and from the ancient 
i learned a lot of interesting things . 
one is used to grow memory may beam training this notion that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 send it to people in your memory 不遗余力 to their heart to . 
these technologies for modern life possible , but we also change . 
not only in the culture , and i think in the cognitive 
kids don &apos;t need to memory sometimes think how we already forgot to memory . 
in this place on earth are very few places where you can aspire to train people still think may beam culture that memory of an extraordinary memory . 
it &apos;s not so extraordinary to do this all over the world . 
i was fascinated with that these people who want to know how to do . 
a few years ago london of the university of researchers asked to a memory to study there . 
they want to figure out what these people tell us whether somebody else &apos;s brain anatomically in the structure of the different ? 
the answer is no . 
and they are smarter than us ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had negative . 
but compared to the goal is to control the brain than there are brain memory . it &apos;s a very interesting is that the different . 
these people were sent to do functional mri scan the brain when they &apos;re memory number or 人脸 or kind pattern , researchers found that memory contest champion of the brain are activated , where people don &apos;t like . 
notice that they use it in the brain in space , with memory and to navigate . 
why ? what can we figure out what the conclusion ? 
竞争性 较量 memory is a game like the way toward the military 白热化 every year , someone with more effective memory show 赛场 and other ways to catch up . 
this is my friend ben pridmore win a champion three international memory . 
in his 台前 三十六副 have 打乱 sequence card he was going to be in an hour down to is that all of his own invented it , he would have the skills . 
and it &apos;s in this way , he was not a bad word back down to one of binary 4140个 any number only half an hour . 
a cow . 
in the competition 参赛者 of using a lot of different memories of different ways to be using all the skills and can to as a concept psychologists call a delicate code . &quot; 
this idea can humor with a paradox perfect interpret baker called say simple baker / paradox is that i have two people to remember one word to you and i said , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot; 
that &apos;s a baker . 
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot; 
after a while back to you and i said , &quot; remember what i call you remember before the word ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what word ? &quot; 
that was 人名 baker is that people remember the possibility of a word like that was more than a baker that person . 
the same word to different memories . 
why is what ? 
because without any particular 人名 baker . 
you don &apos;t mind with little complicated memory make any . 
but as a baker , normally nouns that we all know what &apos;s baker 
baker with funny white cap . 
they hand and ourselves . 
they came home from work with a toast 扑鼻 . 
maybe some people have a friend &apos;s bread 
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to produce all kinds of ways that we can , in this after a while , can still remember . 
this exact memory skills 两千五百年 in front of the ancient greeks have . 
and call it memory palace 
invented the process of this is a technique simonides called the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party 
in fact , he &apos;s been asked to do , because in the performing guest in the fancy cool party , which is not just d. j. to play reduction , but to please poet ode to . 
he stood up back out 全篇 诗作 潇洒 and then he died he just walk outside dinner party hall is on the come down on all sorts of people died . 
not all death all of them were 面目全非 to come down on 
nobody says that you have to have some of the people who don &apos;t like to tell who &apos;s sitting 
the body can &apos;t get to the 殉葬 place . 
this whole thing again reinforce the tragedy of color . 
as a site simonides standing outside of the survivors close your eyes thrust upon realized in his mind in front of him what 宾客 all sitting there . 
he was hold the hand through ruins relative to bring to their family around . 
simonides 醒悟 thrust upon was something that we all have probably guessed . it &apos;s no matter how much we don &apos;t name to remember every phone number or colleagues that we all have the visual or space is exquisitely sensitive memory . 
if i asked you to recap 逐字逐句 i showed you before simonides story about 10 words should not many people will remember . 
but i bet , if i show you now back down in the foyer . you &apos;re sitting in would speak 骏马 brown on who you understand what i mean . 
this advice from the latin 两千多年 ago , the first memory . 
so what is this phrase principles ? 
if you were invited to stand in the center of the ted stage 脱稿 and you want to talk to 西塞罗 like in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the talk 霸气 that he would go one , and you want . 
you have to do is to imagine yourself standing on their front 
and imagine working with a completely crazy memorable to come up with one you like to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster mr. ed sitting on the back . 
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends cook ed 
and then you have a mind 小甜甜 britney like you to think about going to talk about that little story about britney 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is you spend a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 association can 仙 spaces 
this is rome going home reciting talk 稿 secret . not bad , not just a word reciting will only 添麻烦 flat , but remember , one by one . 
and that phrase , &quot; which is &quot; from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is to talk about 古时候 rhetorical or people , would use in space . 
phrases &quot; one &quot; means your memories palace 第一层 . 
it &apos;s too much fun for me it &apos;s a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started to more detailed 萌发 . it &apos;s about the rodeo memory culture . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is memory process is very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there . 
it &apos;s not very exciting moment is a small source 揉 somebody 揉 . 
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing ! 
i know that these people in the brain 惊涛骇浪 must be , but i can &apos;t see 外人 as 
i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience . 
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 spend 20 minutes to try something . 
there &apos;s my little poem . 
back in 跳蚤市场 back and i bought a 年鉴 old people . 
i was surprised to find that it &apos;s actually very 带劲 
try not to go even surprise 
interesting is really the goal is not going to train memory . 
but you &apos;re trying to produce better creative imagination in your mind working build with that completely 胡乱 your character is memorable . 
and it became my fun . 
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit . 
it &apos;s a whole 耳塞 镜面 护目镜 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory is the biggest enemies attention distributed 
and again , i went back to a year ago 赛场 竞 the story . 
i also want to signed up for a impulse that as an experiment in the news . 
when i thought to be in 前言 调侃 yourself as well . 
the question is , experiment finally got unexpected results . 
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
back to me now talk 稿 phone number or shopping is a piece of cake . it &apos;s great , but these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks memory works is because the human brain 依仗 them some basic principles . 
don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember 几副 the order of the cards and you can actually from understanding brains work in get some benefits . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 that is not . 
powerful memory is can acquire . 
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember 
engaged , can remember 
memory palace , or that memory skills are just 捷径 . 
they &apos;re actually really 捷径 deemed 
this work is because forces you to think about it . 
it forces you to go deeper to give you more focus most people don &apos;t normally painless to the training 
actually 捷径 doesn &apos;t exist . 
this is that we have to remember things . 
i discovered by having experience in our bodies 潜藏 with an amazing memory . 
but if you want to live memorable is to do that remember often memory . 
thank you . 
who pull lee : the key to success 沃斯 duke willpower ? 
on my 27th , i resigned as a very challenging career -- business management , and to turn into a more challenging professional : education . 
i came to some new york public school taught seven grade math . 
the teachers and other students , i &apos;m going to do a little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
when these 试卷 assignment and open up , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst of the only difference between the students . 
some are good 课业 in the students don &apos;t have a very high iq points . 
some very smart kids , did not 课业 in 尽如人意 so on . 
this got me thinking . 
of course , students in seven grade need to learn that there is hard , like rates , small number , the area 四边形 parallel computation . 
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , and they would spend time and effort . 
after a few years later , i have a lesson that in education , we need to do is learn dynamic perspective and from the perspective of psychology to student learning behavior , and have a more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we all know , evaluating students standards is good , but if iq in schools and the good life depends on you . it &apos;s not just the ability to learn for efficient ? 
all i left the stage , back to school on studying psychology master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids and large people , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and in treaties study , and my question is , who &apos;s success , why are they &apos;ll succeed ? 
i and my research group 西点 research , to point out . 
we try to predict what tolerance to live fellow to be elected to the military training , which will be tolerated zone out . 
before we go to see the word competition , and also try to predict what kids can level-up at the end of the game . 
we study in hostile environment work work , just the right , the teachers would ask them what teacher decided to stay in the end of the academic year , and they 任教 of who can increase the quickly school students . 
we work with 私企 to ask , what they could sell them to work . 
what can the more money ? 
in all the different context , a character , this one look out for a very large extent predicted success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
it &apos;s not nice appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is passion and the long-term goal to carry on . 
tenacity is 恒 sustainable have something happened . 
tenacity is you on every day , for the future is not just for a week or a month , but a few decades trying to struggle to their dream and reality . 
tenacity is to life as a marathon . it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower . 
i have to 初中生 千名 on the survey , and about willpower waiting for more than a year , and look at what graduate students can . 
all is not just in the country , or 西点 point in the competition to build words that willpower . this is also in school , especially in the dropout 徘徊 for the kids . 
for my own self , about willpower me the most incredible things is heading for willpower , we develop willpower cognitive , in understanding the science that &apos;s how poor . 
every day have parents and teachers to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and how to move their long-term is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t allow you to gritty heart . 
our data that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , which we usually see data with other factors , tenacity off , even without the talent and scale run counter . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard about children grow tough qualities in the most effective , called &quot; growing mindset . &quot; 
william 卡洛杜 at stanford university , with a view , and he believed in people &apos;s ability to learn , it can change the way , and as you try to change . 
杜威克 professor means , when kids learn to read and knowledge about brains and its facing challenges , what happens is , they fail to grow up and then more susceptible to keep going , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure . 
so , growing sexual 大有裨益 mindset to develop willpower . 
but we need more . 
and so i decided to close my comments , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is facing in front of the work . 
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to them to practice . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s desire for success and failure and wrong , to benefit from the experience from these fail again and again . 
in other words , we only have their own to become more have willpower to get our children to become more have willpower . 
thank you . 
steve titus : 泽维尔 dimension into that local culture . 
as an architect , i will , in architecture and design thinking , buildings , around with the environment around , and building and the environment , which is the relationship between tradition . 
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples based on this idea . 
these two examples are in the country , a in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
one of those cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture analysis , made a design solutions important components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall . 
this was my team and i get the same example , we were asked to design , it looks like . 
i first saw this feeling is , i really don &apos;t want to do . 
looking at the same this kind of buildings -- the city , a lot of this kind of building -- we discovered these buildings , the most important three questions . 
first , the building is basically empty , because they there are some big store , people are not the big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because architecture outside the roads are glass , this design to heat trapped inside , and this has led in architecture , we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in this city , because this is the city climate 宜人 fairly stable , throughout the year in the temperature 左右. 25度 . 
the third problem is the building looks a little bit of a relationship with africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t . 
so for a city of rich 底蕴 culture , it &apos;s called people down . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was so fascinated with the local 集贸市场 . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the built environment , in the hands of 小商贩 from to buy products . 
this is the same idea to me , is in outdoor public setting the idea of creating activities . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 贯彻 this idea of building ? 
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist . 
and this building back and forth on the street in front , two parallel 几百米 , there are no little can connected . 
so we need to do is use the buildings , so we have portal , all the way to connect these two together . 
and then we have a gradient of 庭 design , create an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian 日晒雨淋 by . 
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same . 
i think one of the problem is , how decoration building outside walls ? 
and i really want to find a design for decoration , to local environment . 
and i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole in the concrete , can make a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building . 
we from ethiopia women beautiful pattern of the traditional dress got inspiration . 
these patterns of contains some geometry from the texture , and i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls . 
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and control in the way we light into the building . 
in order to do this point , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , inside the building up at night . 
one of these ideas , but we don &apos;t touch , to build their response , sort of , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all know , the design solutions to than traditional mall solution to make more money , because this design solutions to sell shop number more . 
and this outside walls design , reduced lots and lots of cost , it &apos;s not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than the glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of air conditioning to control the temperature . 
and we ultimately save part of the budget . 
builds stage of the first question is , how about building to that question , because the electricity in the city in almost every day to pull 闸 pushing electricity . 
so we were on the roof of the solar panels . 
and then we can think , on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , and here , in a city oasis 小憩 for people . 
on the roof of these 游廊 , by using to focus on for harvesting rainwater , building inside the clean . 
we &apos;ve covered in 第五层 to predict the next year , as well . 
the second example is a city plan for tunisia 2000套 than collateral infrastructure and an apartment buildings . 
do this big scale project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i need not just very profound understand tunisia the city , and she also need to understand that those tradition and culture . 
and in the process of my attention to be a 聚居区 arabs , this is the structure of history has a brick wall , over thousands of years , there are 12 structure 相互之间 , by the way to almost a straight line . 
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets , to cut the 12 primary small areas in size , and there are similar to the features we in barcelona and other european cities common blocks planning . 
in these blocks planning basis , any mentioned idea , we chose the key points , some of the key to connect with straight line , to change a model . 
the last step is to think about the design of the building in areas like the apartment , this is a cubicle , made this big planning basic components . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what is the best towards ? 
and the answer is to , you can use 南北朝 南北 house on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we do this pattern , and all of them have perfect apartment . 
this is the effect , as we design a city style combination , the house with a combination of european style . 
there &apos;s some building with the garden walking around on the ground , and the whole sidewalks to connect . 
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management service 上层建筑 , population density of the population density high , not as high . 
and she &apos;s a entry to get us to connect between 通性 . 
this is the roof of the project i 得意 part , it &apos;s like these buildings are going to be up space to gave community . 
the community can climb on the roof and poke somebody talk to each other , my god , or make some sport , like in the morning , ran a 两公里 on the roof , or on the back and forth between jump . 
these two in some cases , the design process with the same way . 
again , they were in the city , you can see buildings 拔地而起 little intuitive . 
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether it &apos;s the future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate . 
for this reason , i think about the architectural design for me , this is , how much more important , and for simple solutions , cheap enough to increase and promote the local people , and civic relationship , and the good to get people to nature . 
thank you very much . 
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;m going to tell you about trust , people said that the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in reality society has become a cliche . 
i think there are three things like this . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a broad consensus . 
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 . 
and the third is : we need to rebuild 信任感 task . 
i think people to this proposition , purpose and task that are wrong . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is a purpose and with this task , a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is : why people believe in decline 信任感 think ? 
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think it &apos;s a 信任感 down , but that is that in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls , polls should be in decline 信任感 think is out . 
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this idea . 
so , in the last 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and mainly politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted . 
and 20 years ago is highly trust people like the judge and nurse , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in the social 居中 these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
polls records , of course , is that some people . 
or polls can record ? 
but it &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , what they would say . 
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ? 
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot; 
you trust sell fish ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them what to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart the ask . 
when you understand what &apos;s the problem , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
very rational answer . 
in short , in our lives , our reality in different ways for trust . 
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types concrete analysis . the civil servant , official will be , and people type into . 
for example , i would say , i certainly believe a primary school math teacher i know how to teach students reading . but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus . 
maybe , and i know she &apos;s not really a good drivers . 
i might believe i drink that love to a friend &apos;s friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , and he &apos;s a secret . 
it &apos;s that simple . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 said , well why 糊涂 at polls , when we think more conceptual 信任感 to ? 
i think polls is a very bad 信任感 measure whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s a good 抹杀 people to consider 信任感 poor judgment . poor judgment . 
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ? 
it is we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think that it was ridiculous . 
i think this is not the purpose . 
i should say , for people to trust more trusted not to trust , and not trusted people . 
in fact , i said it was trying not to trust not trusted people . 
for example , who put their savings to that looks like it &apos;s like they were money to roll out 麦道 夫 mr. people , i think that people say , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s so easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
wise to trust and wise to choose not to trust that &apos;s the purpose . 
so some people say , well , ok , this is the most important is not going to trust , but credibility of ? 
so in some ways to judge other people are trustworthy . 
i think the need to make decisions about three . 
to see if they do ? honest allows you to do ? good ? 
if we think that allows you to a person is , in his own area is allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe in them , because they can trust . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not they send it to help me with it , because they &apos;re forget . 
i was very confident some friends , they &apos;re able to do , but i think some of them too confident . 
i &apos;m glad to say is , of course , my friends were allows you to reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest . 
maybe there is , i haven &apos;t found . 
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation of . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions accountability for the rules , is to be a professional level or official on these making it easier for us to determine whether there &apos;s credibility . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that . 
and i remember 助产士 a talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 接生 than a child and hard . &quot; 
in our lives , our public institutions lives , we found a lot of questions . the institution accountability for the institutions that can enable their reputation as can be trusted by institutions to see it &apos;s the opposite . 
it allows people to work on their own 助产士 , for example , and they put them in the time to waste 填表 . like i just mentioned . 
you actually have this experience . 
many purpose to talk about . 
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , are attitude , not all of you here . 
and thirdly , about the task . 
the task called 信任感 rebuild . it &apos;s got the . 
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust . 
well , we can do for ourselves . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but what was roots , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from each other . 
you can &apos;t fix people say to you . 
you need to make any 家信 people trying to get you . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful evidence , let them know that you are trustworthy . 
how to do that ? 
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , often very effective . 
i give you just a simple marketing , for example . 
i can say there &apos;s a store to buy me come back , they never ask any questions . 
and they will 退货 退货 , i take , or give me change is my favorite color socks . 
it &apos;s good . i trust them because they make . i think they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very good trustworthy an idea . say to yourself , you have confidence . 
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell . 
people are trustworthy people , and is a relationship between the people . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
科林 托克斯 : the film , the manhood . 
as the father made me happy , is you can see our movies like . 
i love my children to share my movie , when my daughter , four , and together we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
and then a few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
and she put their dressed like 仙女 魔杖 was holding the same . 
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you &apos;ll see this film is so special . 
now , we live , raising kids , kids are in a fantastic into a complicated world . 
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot; 
it &apos;s not like that . 
this trend is 40 years later today &apos;s popular . it &apos;s interesting is , and there &apos;s a movie 大个儿 iron 毛绒绒 and a guy to mimic the enemy of safeguard to save a girl . 
you know , that &apos;s what movie ? ... 
right . 
well this film , there are many different 仙 tracking 绿野 , &quot; we &quot; to see all the film in recent years 两三 . there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence in . 
it &apos;s the sort of violence , and this apple . 
but today , i think if we track 绿野 film &quot; 仙 巫师 , say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re prophecy of saving oz people . 
use your magic 巫婆 bad slippers to beat the army . &quot; 
but , it &apos;s not like that . 
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; unique , and it &apos;s shown in the most heroic role , intelligence , even bad are women . 
i was in a few years later , together with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized that , that it &apos;s a slightly different . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
it was three . 
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him look . 
but as a home for a second child , his care suddenly sort of a lot . 
and he also run in , and then the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck born see as a duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , but he clearly i became obsessed with this . 
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons . 
it &apos;s video theme of courage and willpower and faithful ? 
also 卢克 or joins the army remove the government ? 
&quot; 绿野 一下1939年 contrast 仙 tracking . &quot; 
dorothy is how to win ? 
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders . 
and i hope their kids can in this environment -- oz world -- beat up , and it &apos;s not going to play this world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality . 
why do we give children movies have so many violence so little yellow brick way ? 
for women &apos;s film about men &apos;s violence on , there are many brilliant analysis , you should look at articles written . very good . 
this boy . for the atmosphere , i read the article not that much . 
and my own experience , 从莱娅 , what about the environment guide me not to get to experience in real life , adult world adults to children into the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; 混居 men and women . 
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the end of the movie 演员表 , preferably something that &apos;s there , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
my mission accomplished 芳 won , heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t know what to do . 
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time with other and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re boys , you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be 战袍 wear . 
of course , as an example of in front of you and i &apos;m going to defend the princess disney . 
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not these films this audience . 
these are a lot of a movie all because it &apos;s taught girls to fight 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society . 
kids don &apos;t idol 寻 can . 
we also have some amazing women for our children to write a new story 特里斯 and kevin , including 赫敏 like this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i recommend to all of you are now in the movie . project . 
you remember the brave legends of criticism , &quot; just project ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 and started to do the movies . &quot; 
it &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , almost all of these films , not by 贝克德 &quot; test . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
this test for what people don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do about them . 
alison 德尔 贝克 , is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her and a friend in and they saw the movie about content . 
very simple , only three questions : what if there &apos;s more than a film that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
think about the standard . 
if you are , female characters in movies , to do that ? 
if you have to , with their common 心上人 talking about it ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
there are two women , to speak , there . 
it &apos;s this movie . i &apos;ve seen in , but we &apos;ve seen , and like the film is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a film good quality 阿尔戈 . &quot; 
oscar for the movie , work very well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i don &apos;t think that should be , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the movie , most of what &apos;s happening in plot 人质 使馆 big has been hijacked events in , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see several scene , men are profound and be in conversation with anxiety . and one of the movie actor is the nice story by the door said , &quot; you sleep , honey ? &quot; 
this is hollywood . 
look at statistics . 
2011 100部 ago , the most popular movies , how many film a heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
just universal picked congressman percentage of women parliamentarians in terms of scale , this is good . 
so this ratio , higher than that , and the percentage of you will get shock . 
last year , new york times published a paper done by the government . 
here &apos;s content . 
the united states every five women in a 性骚扰 met once . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s popular entertainment had wrong . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s because children that movie . 
i even think porn music and movie directly relationship with this , but don &apos;t have a problem . where , when i heard this , i was thinking about statistics 性骚扰 is the population is so much . 
who are they ? how they were teaching out ? 
they leave school ? 
they had no understanding of the movie plot , there &apos;s a male hero 残暴 beat 反派 and get the glory and reward -- is a without friends and don &apos;t speak woman ? 
we have to learn from the story of what ? 
you know , as a up with my father , my daughter to tell you all the parents , just like people to the statistics and 危机感 around the world , we &apos;re going to be prevent them . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be a very important way , i was mainly for my father said . 
i think we should for our boys showing a new manhood . 
now manhood definition had putting the cart before the horse . 
you already know the new economy environment men , women are changing the role of his family 胡口 at home . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters , you know , she said , who ? 
wangari than -- 欧 
wangari 欧 , and the than -- than 葛琳 and up to 
what they have in common ? 
maybe no relationship with beautiful clothes . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their movies than others have more knowledge with others , and to help people share their knowledge for potential . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i want my daughter &apos;s pursuit of this , we hope to my son &apos;s pursuit of this . 
i hope this for more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment and the connection between terrorism 
i want to tell you a story about a little kid . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know his story . 
he lived in a small village in somalia . 
this is from the capital &apos;s 加迪休 village . 
this little village , because it &apos;s been so poor drought 食不果腹 people . 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities . 
he had the opportunity , no , no , no prospects . 
and only lived in the town &apos;s 加迪休 &apos;s in the country . 
about a year in the past , and there &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat my breakfast and lunch and dinner . 
he &apos;s alive with a bunch of people , and he &apos;s got rest . 
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes , can give their own native to send money . 
they give him introduced a young girl . 
and they get married . 
he started a new life . 
life also has his goal . 
one day in 加迪休 &apos;s 碧蓝 in the sky happened a car bombing . 
this is the city dream town boy is that the bomb , and when that help dynamic people , &quot; is &quot; the party and al qaeda had a terrorist organization . 
this little boy just want to go through a city through the story of why he &apos;s a suicide attack for the end ? 
he actually wait . 
he &apos;s waiting for a chance to wait for the future of he can go out a way , and that &apos;s his first encounter road . 
this is going to be like him from 成年期 waiting for the first encounter . 
and his story over and over the world with different in downtown . 
this is a by their rights , about urban youth unemployment in their story . 尼斯 john 堡 started riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out . 
for young people , cities with dreams , means 大城市 to job opportunities , wealth , but not to enjoy their young people in the city . 
more , is the highest for young people in unemployment . 
in 2030 , five people living in cities , there &apos;s three is under 18 belongs to the people . 
if we in urban development , not to young people . think about , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities for you come across this story 成年期 terrorism and violence and gang 雷池 these will be the future of cities . 
i was born in the city , who &apos;s unemployed in 加迪休 70 percent . 
70 percent didn &apos;t work didn &apos;t read books . 
basically do nothing 
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing in the eye hospital was full of play in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it be ? 
if i get to in the same 成年期 waiting for ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
and i did say no . 
last month , i 加迪休 &apos;s back to the reason is to have a young leadership and entrepreneurship learned summit 
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership 
we sat down and working together to solve a city to the biggest problem . 
and in a room aden called the young people . 
he &apos;s in 加迪休 graduated from college , and on . 
there was no job , nothing . 
i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work very frustrated , &quot; is &quot; the party ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit . 
the people that look like this . 
but his story , it &apos;s another version 
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and the biggest hurdle is the 
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , actually , it became the easy-to-use tools . 
and that opportunity aden on catch it . 
he built a motorcycle company . 
started a motorcycle cab to the people who couldn &apos;t afford motorcycle 
in 亲朋好友 help he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years spread 数百辆 
he &apos;s the story of how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i believe , is he going to find opportunities and opportunity . 
this is entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is about 成年期 waiting for the most effective tool . 
he drove young people become they all crazy in search of economic opportunity makers 
you can put young training into entrepreneurs . 
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a meeting his name is a mohamoud doctor-heroes 名花 business . 
he was trained in business to help me on the summit of young people train them how to create entrepreneurial innovation . 
if you ask people , &quot; what is the last time you see ? &quot; flowers , civil war was born in time for many of them will be the answer is , &quot; never seen before . &quot; 
so from that doctor-heroes opportunities . 
he created a 园林 greening and companies and design . 
he &apos;s in agriculture 加迪休 outside , go on a tulip 百合花 and he starts to grow those flowers , and he said to a bad climate 加迪休 &apos;s . 
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in town , business and busy . now he &apos;s busy 22年 加迪休 &apos;s built the first citizens park . 
now , there &apos;s no citizens 加迪休 &apos;s in park . 
he wanted to create a space for young people , can family together here , as he said , to inspire and feel 花香 rose . 
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire people so in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep . 
they don &apos;t want to business . 
they thought for civil society organizations work for government work , but in this case , he innovation for those people very big . 
he makes those young people with the opportunity to reframe the cities . 
he makes they believe they can also be entrepreneurs can also be changing the world . 
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now . 
they came up with a business solution to local problems . 
so people creating companies that culture is big step across , but people need money to make their ideas . 
they need mentors guide expertise and development and take them on their business 
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , the transition from idea to help them make you equivalent to create a catalyst for cities 
for me , entrepreneurship is not just open business 
it also create social impact . 
it &apos;s not just in sell doctor-heroes 
i think he &apos;s in the sales of hope . 
his name is peace park , he took the building , and it will really change the meaning of this city of people . 
on the side of the street children aden hired to help him cab and help keep the motorcycle 
he gave them the opportunity to escape from to escape from the unfortunate 成年期 wait . 
these young entrepreneurs all of them have a profound impact cities . 
so my suggestion is that move more young people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more flowers and peace , and the story of the park , there &apos;s not that car bomb and 成年期 waiting for the story . 
thank you . 
薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read the chinese word for . 
i grew up in taiwan as a 书法家 . my daughter , one of the most precious memory for my mom &apos;s shows the chinese word for the beauty of the care about . 
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language . 
but for me , the chinese word for 门外汉 to china as 高不可攀 wall . 
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how to tackle this wall , and that to understand and look at this complex language elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way , to learn the chinese word for . 
from five up , i started to learn how to draw the sequence , a part of writing , and the chinese word for . 
fifteen years time , i learn new the chinese word for every day . 
because we are only five minutes time , should have a much more easy way to learn faster . 
a chinese scholar 二万个 the chinese word for that . 
you just need to know the chinese word for a thousand , can read simple literature . 
the chinese word for that top 二百个 , so you see it -- 40 percent of the basic enough to read literature sign , to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
today i &apos;m using the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
put your mouth is better get bigger , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words . 
this is a person who is in walking . 
&quot; one &quot; words . 
this is a tree . 
&quot; wood . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; signs like wild about comfort in cars on a door . 
i call this eight words for basic words . 
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
a &quot; people . &quot; 
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
a phrase from people , two , three people for the public . 
if somebody open arms , and people said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
&quot; on &quot; to &quot; and &quot; people in this , people were stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison 徒 , like , &quot; get stuck in about a whale in . 
tree is &quot; wood . &quot; &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot; 
three trees together , is &quot; forest . &quot; 
put a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 on a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot; 
remember to a very easy , because it &apos;s going to speak trees 呆傻 things . 
remember , &quot; and &quot; ? 
两团 &quot; fire &quot; together , it becomes very hot &quot; . &quot; 
三团 &quot; fire &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much . 
it &apos;s two trees in the next , will &quot; burn . &quot; 
the sun is for us , all life sources . 
the two together , is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around . 
the three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot; 
when the sun shines together , and the moon , which is &quot; light . &quot; 
one night and day one , is &quot; tomorrow . &quot; 
from the sun rises on the horizon is 旦 . &quot; . &quot; 
a &quot; in the door . &quot; and put a piece of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot; 
to put a 张嘴 on the door is , &quot; asking . &quot; 
&quot; bang ! &quot; , someone at home ? 
this was even outside 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; and &quot; escape . &quot; 
on the left , we have a woman . 
two women together , maybe have debate . 
three women together , be careful , is through &quot; 姦 . &quot; 
we &apos;ve learned about 30 the chinese word for . 
and through this way , this eight basic words can secondary up into 32 the chinese word for . 
the next eight of offspring out there , the chinese word for the chinese word for 32 . 
so , you can easy to learn hundreds of the chinese word for eight years old , china , so that &apos;s equivalent to the children of chinese language . 
these are the words in school , and we started to build a phrase . 
for example , the &quot; and &quot; to &quot; and &quot; together , we have &quot; volcano . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot; 
we know that japan is the sun rises place . 
here to the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china . 
so to the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot; 
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; people , we get what ? &quot; 
&quot; the japanese . &quot; 
the word up and down the mountain , there are those two together . 
in the ancient chinese 流亡 , which means , because china clothes 政敌 put them in the outside . 
today , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go out . &quot; 
&quot; and &quot; a word tell you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot; 
this slide , it reminds me of the talk , and walking down the table . thank you .
