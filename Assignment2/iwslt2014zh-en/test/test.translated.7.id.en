jay meg : why is not new was 20 , 30 years old .  (1)
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need psychiatric patient treatments .  (2)
when i was a university in berkeley read clinical psychologist . they 3d students .  (3)
she &apos;s a called alex 26 women .  (4)
the first meeting , alex wearing jeans and slightly 不修边幅 of 上衣 , in my office , sit directly to the couch , kick off her shoes , and she said to me , is to tell me about men &apos;s question .  (5)
when i heard this , and i disengaged .  (6)
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 .  (7)
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people i want to talk about boys .  (8)
i thought i could manage this thing .  (9)
but i can &apos;t do .  (10)
alex in every meeting , all that funny story , so to me 点点 head out on , and the result of the time is a very relaxing things .  (11)
alex would say , &quot; this is the new , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right .  (12)
in order to have to work , marry later to have , in order to have children , even after death is to have .  (13)
and i was just like alex 二十几岁 people apart from the time , nothing .  (14)
but not too long , i have just 催 i started to push alex love life .  (15)
i said no .  (16)
i said , &quot; yes , she and her on a date , and the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot;  (17)
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next that people get married .  (18)
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time is the best in before she got married . &quot;  (19)
this is what psychologists call &quot; and it turns out that ! &quot; moment .  (20)
in that moment , i learned that 30 is not new 二十岁 .  (21)
yes , people more than ever late 安顿 off , but that doesn &apos;t mean that alex 二十几岁 between , this is her development 低谷 .  (22)
this makes alex 二十几岁 development of a good time , and we &apos;re sitting there spoil it .  (23)
and then i understood that &quot; kindness oversight &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love life for people around the 二十几岁 family and the future .  (24)
now , america had about 5千万 二十几岁 people .  (25)
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think about that nobody can &apos;t experience 二十几岁 stage in this case , over a period of adults .  (26)
if you &apos;re 二十几岁 , take a hand .  (27)
i really want to see here , 一些二十几岁 people .  (28)
that &apos;s great ! you are awesome .  (29)
if you work with 二十几岁 people , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , because if you 二十几岁 people and lost o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people very important .  (30)
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true .  (31)
we know that a human lifetime 80 percent of the most important moment occurred in 35 years old .  (32)
that means every 10 to your life would be the kind of experience with &quot; ! &quot; moment of that . there are eight happened in 30 中旬 .  (33)
more than 40 years , people don &apos;t worry .  (34)
i think this audience , no problem .  (35)
we know a career in 10 years ago for how much money you will make a very big impact .  (36)
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 before and 终生 mate married , 同居 , or on a date .  (37)
we know in your brain when 二十几岁 to adapt to the second time period as adults are the last time into a peak , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own , now what is change its time .  (38)
we know life than other stages 二十岁 , some of the biggest change , and we knew that women reproduction in 28 years old , reach the summit to 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do .  (39)
so your 二十几岁 between , this is tell your own body state and the choice of the time .  (40)
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know about five years ago brain development and admiration language is the critical period .  (41)
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact period of time .  (42)
but we hear a few is have something called adult development , and our 二十岁 this stage is adult development of the critical period .  (43)
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard .  (44)
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change .  (45)
researchers have called 二十几岁 extending adolescence .  (46)
journalist for 二十几岁 people additional stupid names , like , &quot; in the middle , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot;  (47)
it &apos;s true .  (48)
as a culture , we get is actually adult 期中 not known as the most important decades that matters .  (49)
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a big thing , we need a plan and not enough time .  (50)
this , right ?  (51)
so when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; what happens when you think ?  (52)
nothing happens .  (53)
you take that guy and urgency worked , but nothing happening .  (54)
and everybody says , &quot; if i just before the 30 started my career , that &apos;s fine . &quot; that kind of thing .  (55)
but then they start : &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have the show .  (56)
i graduated from the best day 写写 my résumé . &quot;  (57)
and then they start : &quot; when 二十几岁 date as a seat in games .  (58)
you running around , and , having fun with it , but to about 30 music will stop off a after another , you start to sit down .  (59)
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he was that i recently . &apos; &apos; chair . &quot;  (60)
and the 二十几岁 people out there ?  (61)
don &apos;t do this thing .  (62)
well , that sounds that might have a little 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , and very high currency .  (63)
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you have 30 this stage in a very short time to pick a career , a city , find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure .  (64)
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and start looking like that , in this phase 三十几岁 and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big .  (65)
the middle of a thousand years after the crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy .  (66)
that is my job is not that they want .  (67)
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or unable to their children a long .  (68)
i want to change 二十几岁 people what to do best .  (69)
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do that .  (70)
this is a about a woman called emma story .  (71)
when emma 25 , because she came to my office , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis .  (72)
she said she thought she wanted to do art and entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent on doing at .  (73)
because she &apos;s relatively cheap , and she showed that worked 脾气 more and more than my boyfriend live together .  (74)
and no matter how hard it is 二十几岁 her , she had to live more difficult .  (75)
she was meeting , crying , but often say , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down .  (76)
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour .  (77)
she bought a new address thin , and she took one morning , fill her connect people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call this a word -- &quot; the blank behind .  (78)
the last 歇斯底里 she looked at me and said , &quot; if i had a car accident , who would take care of me ?  (79)
if i had cancer , who would take care of me ? &quot;  (80)
and i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot;  (81)
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her a treatment .  (82)
emma need a better life , and i know this is her opportunity .  (83)
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , and i &apos;m not going to make a decision that emma for 10 years that flow off .  (84)
so in the next weeks and months , i taught in every three emma 二十几岁 people , both men and women are , should hear things .  (85)
first , i tell emma forget her identity crisis and started to accumulate identity capital .  (86)
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value .  (87)
do you want a for what &apos;s going to be investment .  (88)
i didn &apos;t know emma professional future , and nobody knew about my job , the future , but i know that these : identity capital will to do more identity capital .  (89)
this is a professional accept that multinational , internships that one and you want to try to step up the time .  (90)
i &apos;m not in 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to speak , cannot called exploration .  (91)
it &apos;s called on time .  (92)
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of jobs and get them to count .  (93)
secondly , i tell emma city tribes overestimate .  (94)
the new capital , the new can about people out of almost always from inside the external communities .  (95)
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends .  (96)
yes , about half the people who never 二十几岁 jobs , or not full employment .  (97)
but half is not true , and the connection is weak , put yourself in a group that way .  (98)
half of the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connecting to your neighbor boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 work the way .  (99)
this is not cheating . this is information about how to deliver science .  (100)
and finally , emma that people don &apos;t choose a family , but can choose friends .  (101)
she grew up in the process that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people &apos;s emma , soon to pass and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family .  (102)
i tell emma choice family time is now .  (103)
you might think , is a 30 than 20 , 25 is even better off of the time , and i agreed .  (104)
but when you start getting married in other people into the auditorium , and you manage your 同居 or sleep people don &apos;t call progress .  (105)
in &apos;s marriage kung fu up and down the best time is married before that is , with love is going to work with as rich as consciousness .  (106)
choice family is conscious choices that you want to people , and that &apos;s not just to make that choice you succeed or and the waste of time .  (107)
and how that emma ?  (108)
well , and it turns out that address thin , and she found her an old roommate of a family in another state of an art museum work .  (109)
the weak to help her where a job .  (110)
that job . give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons .  (111)
now , the last five years , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners .  (112)
she and her a consciously chose people get married .  (113)
she loved her new job , her love of his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 row seem to be a big enough . &quot; 的卡 pieces .  (114)
emma story to this thing sounds very simple , but that &apos;s what i love and 二十几岁 people working well .  (115)
it &apos;s so easy to help them .  (116)
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport go somewhere in the west flights .  (117)
after the launch , the change is a little further and further in alaska in fiji difference .  (118)
likewise , or even in 21 25 29岁 , it &apos;s a good , good time to rest , a good tedtalks can 对接 down years is even generations have very big impact .  (119)
this gives a worth spreading to each of you who know 二十几岁 ideas .  (120)
it and i learned to follow alex saying as simple .  (121)
don &apos;t be you don &apos;t know if any do definition .  (122)
now , you &apos;re in determines your life .  (123)
thank you .  (124)
李镇河 : 李镇河 into the computer : &quot; real world , you play &quot; infinite imagination .  (125)
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge the digital information between us and 隔阂 , we have the real world and the gap between the virtual world . in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite .  (126)
it &apos;s a gap in them , would continue to fall , now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , is the touchscreen glass , and then thin computer had is that the people there .  (127)
but i was thinking , and without virtual and real world of borders between the much better ?  (128)
so i started to try this crazy idea .  (129)
i first made that tool , it can number into space , if you take this with a pen that force on the screen , and a pen pen and goes into a little pixels of virtual worlds .  (130)
designers directly in three-dimensional space for their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery .  (131)
so , the tools to break the virtual and real world of borders between .  (132)
but we still hands on the screen .  (133)
how can we reach into and digital information to have interaction , and we use flexible hands ?  (134)
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 re-engineered this computer the keyboard on top of a space to work within the least numbers .  (135)
because in reality window and file space is , pick exactly where they become like from the shelves take a book that easy .  (136)
and you can read the book , and in every floating window and virtual touch across the board of words . and sentences .  (137)
architects directly with their hands or stretched rotate all kinds of models .  (138)
in this example , that we &apos;re now entering the digital world .  (139)
but how can transform it to get the role of digital information into our world ?  (140)
believe in a number of people have online shopping and 退货 experience .  (141)
but , now than you don &apos;t worry about .  (142)
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version 试衣间 in line .  (143)
this is the system we analyzed the physical features , geometry , through the loads of or look at a way that show us the time .  (144)
but , again , i started thinking about this idea further , how can we make the space of the visible pixels little switch to actually get to touch , feel stuff ?  (145)
this is what the future might look like ?  (146)
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner , steve 雷米 persian together , make it a &quot; matter pixels points . &quot;  (147)
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 like we are in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and the objects that people will move into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space of any place .  (148)
we make the basic principles are , to eliminate gravity pellets . and it &apos;s magnetically levitated , mechanical sense , technology and drive it together to control pellets movement .  (149)
by the kinds of digital programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , people can movement in the physical world can be recorded , back and forever , keep .  (150)
so , dance 编排 can be remote and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action can over and over again , to actually be repeated itself .  (151)
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement and physics , and different from a computer screen or the textbook , this is learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force .  (152)
more exciting is that this is not the computer put things into a real stuff , but to think , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity .  (153)
and as you can see , digital information will just make things that give us , but we &apos;ll start acts to become part of our physical environment , not cut our relationship with the real world .  (154)
my talk today is talk about &quot; from &quot; the border to , if we could remove the border , the rest is our enormous imagination .  (155)
thank you .  (156)

not a big people believe that i &apos;m serious .  (169)
there &apos;s only my 小伙伴 they supported me , but they also as a child , and i powerless .  (170)
it was 15 , i know i &apos;ve learned to play much older .  (171)

&#91; &quot; 三毛 全集 &quot; and &quot; 南怀瑾 historical experience . &quot; i 1995 , to the united states in america , i first read what book ?  (178)
of course , is that the chinese 禁书 .  (179)
the earth is about &quot; the chinese farmers .  (180)
real to be propaganda . okay .  (181)
bible interesting , but also very strange .  (182)
the topic 他日 and talk about .  (183)
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot;  (184)
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; not equal and farther than &quot; submission . &quot;  (185)
it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tools , it turns out i climb 儒家 负罪感 tool to rebuild , my relationship with their parents .  (186)
to a new culture and environment , as i used to read it , to a new culture and environment , as i read a habit .  (187)
it allows people to read more profound .  (188)
for example , first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is the chinese students from big to use a world map .  (189)
never before i realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily need to in the middle of a world map .  (190)
this map , with a view .  (191)
compare reading is not new .  (192)
it &apos;s academia standards in practice .  (193)
比较文学 , even more religion being studied field of religion . 比较文学 , even become specialized research .  (194)
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding . contrast to control scholars to a project has a full understanding .  (195)
and i wonder , now that &apos;s reading on useful , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ?  (196)
so i started putting a book about to read .  (197)
they can be about the same event different parties , they can be about the same event different parties , or two friends have shared experience .  (198)
jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation .  (199)

if you understand the language , take your favorite books of two versions read versus language is very interesting .  (201)
so thomas 默 translation . &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 de watts translation of the moral approaching -- people always say , &quot; we always have lost one , i actually found that translation can lead to harvest .  (202)
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning it &apos;s called &quot; rapid joy , &quot; well ...  (203)
&quot; bride chinese word for it , and the literal meaning &quot; new &quot; mom , my god !  (204)
i had become the book and lack of communication 今人 portal , a wonderful book , i had become 今人 and lack of communication , a magic .  (205)
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless .  (206)
other people &apos;s suffering , not to dream 破灭 . what other people &apos;s suffering , not dream 破灭 than anything .  (207)
i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose .  (208)
its purpose is the most important for us to touch dream sources of places , passion sources of places , pleasure from places .  (209)
even a broken 灭 dreams can also make your experiencing that touch .  (210)
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , live happily , life of purpose and meaning to become clear , in most of the time .  (211)
and hope and never will you at any age .  (212)
thank you .  (213)

when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , etc . , but some other students also have high score awfully !  (225)
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all the way , but nothing and creativity  (226)
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line , because i &apos;ve been in it , more to do something completely  (227)
i don &apos;t understand my behavior .  (228)
i don &apos;t understand where this idea is coming out .  (229)
i don &apos;t understand why do when they &apos;re very good  (230)

i don &apos;t understand why i have never been found  (232)
i mean , this thing to do so .  (233)

it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere .  (237)
we know that babies are the envy of torture  (238)
and that primate envy , blue 知更鸟 very comfortable envy  (239)
we know the envy spouses murder agents .  (240)
but i never read an research could explain , &quot; &quot; jealous of lonely it , or it &apos;s sort of devastation .  (241)
in order to understand it , because we had to see novel fiction is a laboratory to study . &quot; &quot; jealous of all possible .  (242)

these books in virginia de 伍尔夫 seems like a cat gut .  (255)

we look at these things come together , so why would 合拍 . fiction and envy envy and 普鲁斯 there .  (257)
妒忌 comes down to people , and from that desire to become a firm foundation narrative is not very obvious ?  (258)
i don &apos;t know . i think it profoundly push our sensitive nerve because just think about when we get jealous , what happens .  (259)
when we get jealous , when we &apos;re going to make myself a story .  (260)
tell a story about his life of these stories make us feel bad because they were just to make the we &apos;d suffered .  (261)

no . i think he &apos;s saying , let &apos;s see what themselves .  (284)
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ?  (285)
other emotional would not let us see their own hostility , ugly attempting heart and what they deserve ?  (286)

freud shortly after that wrote that .  (288)
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think he did his wife and so 憔悴 ours .  (289)

freud said this man is turning into his wife unconscious behaviors guard .  (295)
fiction writing about this very well .  (296)
it &apos;s very good at novel about how we see training pitch , but not gets it right .  (297)
well , we get jealous , the more intense , we &apos;re going to the more often .  (298)
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something illegal or violence .  (299)
envy causes us behavior becomes extreme .  (300)
i admit that i got was eight of ourselves , but i also see on the news came up with a story .  (301)
michigan 一个52岁 women were discovered register a fake facebook account and used to account for their year sending out the malicious news .  (302)

she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before the aisles girlfriend now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her .  (304)
because , i want to say that , you face reality .  (305)
how creative ! just with the wrong place , right ?  (306)
this comes from fiction .  (307)
a pie 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 fiction .  (308)
i really love is 海史密斯 writers .  (309)
she is american 文学史 on brilliant and 诡 one page .  (310)
for example , universal , tom in her case , the most famous .  (311)
you want to start 里普利 or want what you have , then you want to be , and you have you ever have locked in his basement 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account .  (312)
this is a road .  (313)
but we do ? we cannot repeat 里普利 .  (314)
i can give to the world has dramatically , even if i would one day be able to do this .  (315)
and unfortunately , because we live in admire times .  (316)
we live in the envy .  (317)
i mean , we are social media better citizens in there is a trend jealous , right ?  (318)
we can give novel solutions , i &apos;m not sure ?  (319)
let &apos;s 学学 fictional characters to it , and see where they met puzzles and the thing is , don &apos;t know how to do .  (320)
let &apos;s go back to the b 221 贝克街 ask 夏洛克 de 福尔摩斯  (321)
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would want to his opponent 里亚蒂 professor -- this crime genius  (322)
but i &apos;ve always liked to a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face a scottish 头子 he really needed to 福尔摩斯 his intelligence , but hate him .  (323)
oh , i don &apos;t know more about that later .  (324)
雷斯 垂 de he needs help , and he hated the mystery of the cases 侦破 always 苦闷 story again .  (325)
we proud of you . &quot;  (326)
it said in the field , nobody would want to hold hands 福尔摩斯  (327)
this is 少数几次 福尔摩斯 we see in the human being touched , when i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ?  (328)
it seems to envy as a geometry , instead of emotions .  (329)
this one minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite  (330)
the next minute they stand in the same .  (331)
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he had hate .  (332)
but what &apos;s so simple ?  (333)
if envy is really a geometric problem to do , a about how we choose the positions relationships with other questions ?  (334)
and then , we &apos;re not going to hate somebody talent .  (335)
we &apos;ll chase .  (336)
but i like contingency plan .  (337)
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction  (338)
it has been going on with envy fiction  (339)
fiction to envy domesticate to serve it please .  (340)

ar : 内格尔 in new york , i found in the trash .  (344)
i was 10 or so , once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a piece of the new york in northern wild zone .  (345)
it was really good weather .  (346)
the forest searched twinkling lights .  (347)
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like the 晶莹 stained glass . if no feet small way , we can actually is at first we pretend that this piece of the human .  (348)
we eventually got to our camp .  (349)
that &apos;s a on a cliff camp , can down a 水晶 晶莹 overlooking a beautiful lakes . and i actually found a bad thing .  (350)
in the back of the cliff camp , have a for about 40 feet 见方 the largest garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil , paper and poor sneakers .  (351)
i was very surprising , very angry , really , really confusing .  (352)
to camp people just too lazy , even myself a garbage ken up . they don &apos;t think anybody would clean 善后 for them ?  (353)
this question bedeviled at all . i became a longer sound bite .  (354)
who to clean we leave the garbage ?  (355)
but you can take this issue on any place you live in a 伊斯坦 . we leave out the garbage ?  (356)
in rio we leave out the garbage ? in paris and london ?  (357)
in new york , here , is we leave the sanitation trucks were parked department cleaned up to 11 , 000吨 trash 2000吨 recycled and every day of waste .  (358)
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (359)
i want to know who are doing this work .  (360)
wear sanitation trucks were parked on this up in a sense of responsibility for what ?  (361)
so i started a sanitation trucks were parked on the research project .  (362)
i was sitting in the car , along the line of the interview in new york , all the sanitation trucks were parked office workers live and work . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 .  (363)
i need a deeper understanding .  (364)
so i actually found a sanitation trucks were parked workers work .  (365)
now i &apos;m not just sitting in 垃圾车 , i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 .  (366)
i myself to manipulate the electric 扫帚 scanners 铲 street , in the snow .  (367)
that &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 the education process .  (368)
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell .  (369)
there is smell , but it &apos;s not that you want to smell bad . sometimes really bad . but you &apos;ll soon adapt .  (370)
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt .  (371)
i know that even a few years of working skilled worker , their bodies have adapted to try and into a week megatons of garbage .  (372)
so there is at risk .  (373)
with the labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked work is the most dangerous , one of the 10 major tasks . i slowly and figure out why .  (374)
you all day on the road , which are of traffic .  (375)
out of the cars , thinking only over you , driving people tend to not careful .  (376)
the sanitation trucks were parked workers for me , it was so bad .  (377)
and yet , the itself is poisoning , these 毒物 often from the 垃圾车 comes out , a horrible harm .  (378)
i also learned the brutal and frightening .  (379)
when you go down , 路沿 sanitation trucks were parked car in the city , you will look at a time to recognize the really like the power of nature itself .  (380)
it &apos;s never 源源而来 .  (381)
it &apos;s like breath , or a circular form .  (382)
it &apos;s always in motion .  (383)
and finally , it &apos;s called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked .  (384)
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe sanitation trucks were parked workers city streets , is the most important labor . three reasons .  (385)
they are public health 第一道 barriers .  (386)
if they don &apos;t rapidly clean efficient day landfill . landfill , going from the container itself , it sort of will poison in a very real way threats to our lives .  (387)
we attacked several century 和数 10 years after the disease will again , we started to threaten our health .  (388)
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers .  (389)
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , we would have no space with something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less .  (390)
i don &apos;t use capitalism , here i just point out their relationship .  (391)
and the third reason -- is what i call our average and necessary , 经常性 activity speed .  (392)
i mean in today &apos;s in the old days , and we are so used to 奔忙 .  (393)
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , we would carry the coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle .  (394)
we use them , and they throw it away , and forget about them , because we know that there is a work in teams were sitting over there put these things densest .  (395)
so today i want to suggest to you about the sanitation trucks were parked situation , maybe help . they &apos;re called them please come to talk about how to build a sustainable city thousands of people .  (396)
i think their work is very noble .  (397)
every time they to individual hard to work on the street .  (398)
in many cities they wear sanitation trucks were parked continues to work .  (399)
you know , they would be on time to clean up garbage .  (400)
they are allowing us to secure in their work .  (401)
they almost became secure work promise .  (402)
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and waste . anyway all this work is going to keep stability .  (403)
september 11th , 2001 , the day i listen to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks and 咆哮 , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing a week he 三都 do work .  (404)
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just cry up .  (405)
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright .  (406)
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot;  (407)
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , again , i met this guy .  (408)
his name is 保利 times , we worked together , you become friends .  (409)
i want to believe that 保利 , right .  (410)
we &apos;ll be alright .  (411)
but we as part of this planet , we need to try to rebuild . we have to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption .  (412)
the city , that we know of garbage actually only about three percent of all domestic garbage .  (413)
this is an amazing data .  (414)
so in your life every day in your life , the river , next time you see somebody in when you leave out the trash , please find a time to their 致意 .  (415)
find a time to say thank you .  (416)
joshua foer , everybody can understand memory .  (417)

now open your eyes .  (438)
i &apos;m going to tell you a annual spring in new york are going to the unexpected .  (439)
it &apos;s called the memory 冠军赛  (440)
a few years ago , as a journalist 科技类 this race to the part about trying to get there , like the geeks who &quot; super bowl , bustling 冠军赛 . &quot;  (441)
a bunch of 屈指可数 men and women grew up in some old boy is still don &apos;t notice personal health  (442)
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that the hundreds of any list of numbers .  (443)
some are trying to remember populations of strangers .  (444)
and within a few minutes , back to the next poem .  (445)
and in the game , who is the fastest way down to remember 一整副 打乱 card sequence .  (446)
i was like , that &apos;s amazing .  (447)
these people surely other talents 禀  (448)
so i started interviewing 参赛者  (449)
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training .  (450)
i asked him , &quot; ed is when you start to realize their memory is genius ? &quot;  (451)
ed said , &quot; i &apos;m not experts .  (452)
and my memory was .  (453)
to participate for each one of them will tell you just average memory .  (454)
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;ve never heard of ? &quot;  (455)
we stood outside the hall 过人 amazing and smart and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist .  (456)
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot;  (457)
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , to ask , why is this ? &quot;  (458)
&quot; because i really wanted to teach in the u.s. national radio britney remember how 一整副 打乱 card sequence .  (459)
you can prove this is that everyone can do . &quot;  (460)
i said , &quot; look , i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me !  (461)
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot;  (462)
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 out in front of me .  (463)
and most of the year i spent time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand how memory works that sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential .  (464)
en route i met a lot of fun .  (465)
one is called e. p .  (466)
he suffers amnesia his memory is probably the world &apos;s worst .  (467)
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember myself have amnesia is very surprising .  (468)
and he &apos;s a tragedy through his character , but we can understand memory in any way to shape our personality .  (469)
this is another extreme i met somebody like this .  (470)
he called kim peek  (471)
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the movie &quot; the rain man &quot; characters in .  (472)
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library , back to phone books , i think is just fascinating  (473)
go home and i read a lot to write papers about memory 两千多年 ago in latin wrote papers from ancient until then , during the medieval  (474)
i learned a lot of interesting things .  (475)
one is used to train illegal beam nurturing memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today .  (476)
曾几何时 people want it to your memories could 不遗余力 to your mind .  (477)
these technologies for modern life possible , but also we change .  (478)
not only in the culture , and i think in cognition  (479)
kids don &apos;t need to remember that sometimes we already forgot about how to memory .  (480)
in this place on earth are very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam nurturing memory . it &apos;s an extraordinary memory .  (481)
it &apos;s not that different around the world are starting to do this .  (482)
i want to be obsessed with these people know is how to do it .  (483)
a few years ago college london school of a team of researchers asked to a contest to study memory .  (484)
they want to figure out the human brain if we follow each other in structure anatomically different ?  (485)
the answer is no .  (486)
and they are smarter than us ?  (487)
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny .  (488)
but compared with the goal is to control the brain memory contest champion of our brain had a really interesting questions that are very different .  (489)
these people were sent to do functional mri brain scanner when they &apos;re memory number or 人脸 or kind pattern , researchers found that memory contest champion of our brain areas activated with ordinary people not too .  (490)
notice that they think , is in the brain in space and memory , it would take to navigate .  (491)
why ? what can we figure out what kind of thing ?  (492)
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective way memory show 赛场 and other people have to catch up  (493)
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the international memory champion .  (494)
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 sequence card to him for an hour down with all that is a he actually invented , and he would only have the skills .  (495)
and with that kind of the way he had a word , not bad back down 4140个 any one of binary . only half an hour .  (496)
very impressive .  (497)
参赛者 in the competition of using a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all the techniques that can end up going into a concept psychologists call a delicate code . &quot;  (498)
the concept could with a paradox of humor perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox is easy to say that i have two people to remember one word i tell you , &quot; remember a guy called baker . &quot;  (499)
baker &apos;s name .  (500)
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot;  (501)
after a while back , i ask you to remember what i call &quot; before you remember the word ? &quot;  (502)
&quot; remember what word ? &quot;  (503)
being told is 人名 baker people remember that term potential as far as not being told a baker , the person .  (504)
the same word cause different memories .  (505)
why is it ?  (506)
because without any particular 人名 baker .  (507)
can &apos;t tell you a little head complicated memory make any .  (508)
but as a baker normally nouns that we all know baker is .  (509)
baker with funny white cap .  (510)
they hand and flour .  (511)
they came home from work with a 扑鼻 toast .  (512)
maybe some people have baker &apos;s friends .  (513)
we first hear this word , would immediately come to all sorts of ways that we can make in after a while , can still remember .  (514)
this precise memory 两千五百年 skills in front of the ancient greeks have .  (515)
and call it palace .  (516)
developed this technique of this is a process called simonides the poet he wanted to go to a dinner party  (517)
and he was being asked to do the performing guest , because in the &apos; cool fancy party . it &apos;s not just d. j. to beat reduction , but to please poet ode to .  (518)
he stood up back out his 全篇 诗作 潇洒 away , and he got out on the front hall dinner party &apos;s come down on all sorts of people died .  (519)
not only all death all of them were to come down on 面目全非  (520)
no one said to them what are some people who don &apos;t like to tell who sat where  (521)
that causes the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬  (522)
and then this reinforce the whole thing color tragedy .  (523)
simonides as standing outside the rubble only survivors close your eyes thrust upon realizing in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 are sitting .  (524)
he would hold hands are relative to the site to bring their loved ones around .  (525)
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we don &apos;t remember to name phone number or colleagues every instructions that we all have very keen visual or space memory .  (526)
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i just tell the story of the top 10 words simonides should not many people will remember .  (527)
but i bet , if i show you now in the back of the foyer . sat will speak brown 骏马 on who you understood that i mean .  (528)
this advice from the latin 两千多年 before the first scholars memory .  (529)
so this phrase works , what is this ?  (530)
suppose you were invited to stand on the ted stage speech center , and you want to do as 脱稿 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome tedx talk on average , he &apos;d that come 霸气 one and you want .  (531)
you have to do is to imagine yourself standing on their front  (532)
and imagine working with a completely crazy memorable sight to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride .  (533)
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster ed mr. sitting on the back .  (534)
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook  (535)
and then you head comes 小甜甜 britney . you &apos;ll remember to talk about britney that little story .  (536)
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is you spent a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association  (537)
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just be the only reciting 添麻烦 but remember , one by one .  (538)
and phrases &quot; theme &quot; quote is from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot;  (539)
this is 古时候 people talk about or rhetorical , will use in space .  (540)
&quot; the phrase &quot; means your memory 第一层 palace .  (541)
it &apos;s a really interesting to me that a lot of interest .  (542)
and then i went to more memory .  (543)
i started a 萌发 more detailed it that the memory of my culture .  (544)
but there &apos;s a problem .  (545)
the problem is memory process is very boring .  (546)
it &apos;s like a group of people 高考 sitting there .  (547)
very exciting moment don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source .  (548)
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing !  (549)
i know that the human mind is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see as 外人  (550)
i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience .  (551)
so i started trying to sit in the morning , looking at new york times before 十五 to spend 20 minutes and try something .  (552)
there &apos;s little back .  (553)
back in my back to buy 跳蚤市场 年鉴 in the old people .  (554)
i was surprised to find it very 带劲  (555)
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise  (556)
interesting is that actually goal is not going to train of memory  (557)
but you &apos;re trying to produce better imagination , creativity , in your mind working to create the myth is completely comical 胡乱 ideally unforgettable images .  (558)
and it became my joy .  (559)
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit .  (560)
it &apos;s a whole 镜面 护目镜 耳塞 a hot black left two little holes , because the memory of the largest distributed attention is the enemy .  (561)
and i went back again a year ago , the story of 竞 赛场 .  (562)
i also want to drive a signed up to participate in the news was that as an experiment .  (563)
when i thought to be in the 前言 调侃 about himself .  (564)
the problem is experiment got the unexpected consequences  (565)
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect .  (566)
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or going shopping is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but these are not important .  (567)
these are little usual tricks  (568)
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles .  (569)
don &apos;t have to really build or laying down memories palace 几副 sequence of the cards and you can actually learn from the brain does have some benefits .  (570)
we always 议论 memory good people always think those other people &apos;s gift 禀 as it is not .  (571)
powerful memory is can acquire .  (572)
from the fundamental 专心致志 can keep talking about .  (573)
engaged , can remember  (574)
memory palace or that memory skills are just 捷径 .  (575)
and they really are deemed 捷径  (576)
this work is because it forces you to think about  (577)
it forces you to go deeper , to want more you focus most people don &apos;t normally cumbersome to the training  (578)
it doesn &apos;t exist 捷径  (579)
this is what we have to remember things .  (580)
by having experiences that i found that our bodies 潜藏 with incredible memory .  (581)
but if you want to live memorable do is to remember that often memory .  (582)
thank you .  (583)
who la lee duke 沃斯 : success willpower keys ?  (584)
on my 27th , when i left a very challenging -- professional management consulting company , turn it into a more challenging professional : education .  (585)
i came to some of the new york public school taught seven grade math .  (586)
and other teachers , as i give students do little test and test .  (587)
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework .  (588)
when these 试卷 homework and open up , and then i calculate their grades .  (589)
i was struck by the iq , the ups are not my best and the worst the only difference between the students .  (590)
some in the 课业 did quite well students don &apos;t have very high iq score on .  (591)
some very smart kids , in the 课业 did not so 尽如人意 .  (592)
this got me thinking .  (593)
of course , students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like rates , small number of 四边形 area , parallel computation .  (594)
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , as long as they would spend time and effort .  (595)
after a few years later , i came to a lesson that in education , we need to learn from the dynamic perspective and psychological level , the students and learning . take a more profound understanding .  (596)
in education systems , we all know the great evaluating students standard iq is , but if in schools and the good life do you rely on the far more efficient not only for the ability to learn ?  (597)
all i left the stage , back to school and entered psychology master &apos;s degree .  (598)
i started studying kids and adults are , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and the instruments , work , my question is , who &apos;s success , why would they succeeding ?  (599)
i and my research group to point out 西点 research .  (600)
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be eliminated zone out .  (601)
before we go to see the word competition , and also try to anticipate what kids can level-up to the end of the game .  (602)
we look at work in hostile environment work , just go in the teacher , ask them to the teacher will continue to stay in the end of the academic year 任教 , and most of them who can quickly to improve the school students .  (603)
we work with 私企 , to ask them what sales people can stay in .  (604)
what can the more money ?  (605)
in all these different context , a character , no one out of that , in which largely predicted success .  (606)
and it &apos;s not social intelligence .  (607)
not beautiful appearance , robust , . it &apos;s not very high iq .  (608)
it &apos;s willpower .  (609)
tenacity is for long-term goal passion and carry on .  (610)
tenacity is have perpetual 恒 something happened .  (611)
tenacity is you for the future , with every day , is not just for a week or a month , but a few years , and for decades trying to make their dream a reality .  (612)
tenacity is put life as a marathon . and it &apos;s not a sprint .  (613)
a few years ago , in chicago public school , i started to research that willpower .  (614)
i said to the 千名 初中生 conducted about the willpower survey , and waiting for more than a year , to see what ultimately to graduate students .  (615)
all is not just in 西点 point or in the words to put the race to willpower . in school is also true , especially about the dropout 徘徊 on the edge of the kids .  (616)
for my own self , about willpower me the most incredible things is heading for tenacity , we develop willpower , cognitive science , in the understanding that was how poor .  (617)
every day have parents and teachers to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ?  (618)
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ?  (619)
and what they move the long-term is motivation ? &quot;  (620)
frankly , i don &apos;t know .  (621)
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t allow you to gritty heart .  (622)
our data suggests that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment .  (623)
in fact , according to our data rates , tenacity usually has nothing to do with other factors , even with the brilliance measures run counter .  (624)
so far , i &apos;ve heard of the children on developing tough qualities , the most effective called &quot; exponential growth mindset . &quot;  (625)
stanford 卡洛杜 william , with a point , he believed that the human learning can change it , as you try and change the way .  (626)
professor 杜威克 means , when kids learn to read and knowledge of the brain and its facing challenges , what was happening and growing situation , after they fail more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe it will always failure .  (627)
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower .  (628)
but we need more .  (629)
i decided at the end of my comments , because we &apos;re going through it .  (630)
it &apos;s eyes with the work .  (631)
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do their practice .  (632)
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in again and again .  (633)
in other words , we just have to become more willpower to allow our children to become more willpower .  (634)
thank you .  (635)
steve titus : 泽维尔 dimension into that local culture .  (636)
as an architect , i was designing buildings , and to think about , building around with the environment , and with the buildings , around the environment , which is the relationship between tradition .  (637)
today , i &apos;m going to share with you two examples , based on this idea .  (638)
these two examples are emerging in a country , in ethiopia , another in tunisia .  (639)
this one , two cases have in common is that design solutions and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components .  (640)
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall .  (641)
this was my team and i get the same example , we were asked to design into this looks like .  (642)
i first saw this feeling is i don &apos;t want to do .  (643)
in this kind of look at the same architecture of the city , -- a lot of this kind of building -- we &apos;ve discovered the architecture of the most important three questions .  (644)
first , the building is basically empty , because they are in large store , people are not the big brands .  (645)
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because the roads are built outside of glass , this design would heat trapped in the interior , and so we need a lot of refrigeration .  (646)
this is not supposed to happen in the city , because the city of the climate is quite 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. .  (647)
the third problem is the building looks like one african or ethiopia didn &apos;t matter .  (648)
for a cultural 底蕴 and abundance of cities , it &apos;s called people down .  (649)
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , when i was so fascinated with the local 集贸市场 . every day , hundreds of people gathered in the outside environment , from 小商贩 in various to buy products .  (650)
this is the same idea to me , is in outdoor public setting create campaigns idea .  (651)
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center .  (652)
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary architecture 多层 贯彻 of these ideas ?  (653)
the second challenge is when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the photograph , you see a lot of buildings , in design , we don &apos;t exist .  (654)
and this building on the before and after two parallel street in front , after all , no small 几百米 can connected .  (655)
so we need to do is we use all of this very building a portal , put these two road linked it up .  (656)
and then we have a gradient of 庭 design , created an open architecture space , and this design by itself to avoid the shape of the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 .  (657)
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same .  (658)
i think , the question is , how buildings outside walls patterns ?  (659)
and i really want to paint , to find a design for the local environment .  (660)
i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole made out of cement , to use a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building .  (661)
we from ethiopia beautiful women on the pattern of traditional dress got inspiration .  (662)
these patterns , contains the geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;ll similar questions were filled with the outside walls .  (663)
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let light and air to control our way into the building .  (664)
in order to do this point , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , in the entire building up at night .  (665)
but the idea that we started building , not touch , they react to things like , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot;  (666)
but then we all know this , to design solutions than traditional mall solution can be more money , because this design solutions to sell more number shop .  (667)
and this outside walls design , a ton of lowering cost , not just because of this material 预制 cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use the air handling so much to control the temperature .  (668)
and eventually , we have saved an part budget .  (669)
builds stage of the first question is , how do we ensure that building to electricity on the question is , because cities are almost every day to pull pushing 闸 electricity .  (670)
so we were on the roof of the solar panels .  (671)
and then we thought , can on the roof , in these solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , to be here in cities , oasis 小憩 for people .  (672)
on the roof of the 游廊 , was to use to collect rainwater , to the interior of clean .  (673)
we &apos;ve built 第五层 expected to , in the next year , done yet .  (674)
the second example is a city planners tunisia for more than a 2000套 apartment buildings and collateral infrastructure .  (675)
do this big scale project , i &apos;ve been doing this is the largest project , i only need was really understand the tunisian city , and she also need to understand all kinds of tradition and culture .  (676)
and in the process of my attention is a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a structure , over thousands of years of history , a brick wall structure , there are 12 相互之间 through the door , almost straight to the road .  (677)
when i started in graph paper planning , the first thing we do is go around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 primary small areas in size and all the characteristics we kind of in barcelona and other common european cities , neighborhoods planning .  (678)
in these blocks planning basis , referenced mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points by connecting straight , changes in the beginning of the model .  (679)
the last step is considered specific region of the design of the building , apartment these kind of a cubicle , is that this poses a fundamental part of the planning .  (680)
that &apos;s when i was thinking about a mediterranean climate , in the apartment , what kind of them is the best ?  (681)
the answer is , can use to 南北朝 house 南北 on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect .  (682)
so we achieve this pattern , and all the apartments have perfect towards .  (683)
this is the effect , we designed like an arab town style , combined with the combination of residential style .  (684)
some of the building areas with garden , and walk around on the ground full of sidewalks to connect .  (685)
and she also meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 population density of the population density high , not very expensive .  (686)
and she has to satisfy our entry out even between 通性 demand .  (687)
this is the roof of the project i 得意 of the most part , it &apos;s like to be these buildings takes up space and back to the community .  (688)
the community can climb roof , each other and poke somebody talk about god , or make some sport , like in the morning , on the roof run a 两公里 , or in the back and forth between jump .  (689)
these two examples , there &apos;s something in common , the design process with the same way .  (690)
again , they are emerging in cities , you can see the little 拔地而起 intuitive buildings .  (691)
in these cities , architecture for people affected , no matter present and future for the local communities and economic impact , to build a building as fast rate .  (692)
for this reason , i think about the architectural design , in terms of how this more and more important , which is , searching for simple solutions , and cheap enough to enhance and promote the local people and civic relationship , and to make people good close to nature .  (693)
thank you very much .  (694)
we onora o &apos;neill : &quot; trust me . &quot;  (695)
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . first , i &apos;d said to you about that , people to trust the basic idea .  (696)
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in real social has become a cliche .  (697)
i think there are three things like that .  (698)
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus .  (699)
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 .  (700)
and the third is task , we should rebuild 信任感 .  (701)
i think people to use this task , and it has the wrong way .  (702)
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , purpose and task a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust .  (703)
the first is : why people believe that in 信任感 down ?  (704)
if i now have evidence on the basis for , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer .  (705)
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but it was in some activity , or in some of the organization . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing .  (706)
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 .  (707)
but of course , i can look at polls , polls to find out about 信任感 in decline .  (708)
but when you really look at different times polls , actually , not many evidence supporting this idea .  (709)
so , that in 20 years ago by people who don &apos;t believe a journalist and mainly politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted .  (710)
and 20 years ago is highly trust people like that , and the nurse , still get altitude of trust .  (711)
the rest is 居中 . by the way , in social 居中 on these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 .  (712)
but the evidence 说得过去 ?  (713)
polls recorded , of course , is that some people .  (714)
or you can record polls ?  (715)
but that &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;re talking about .  (716)
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ?  (717)
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot;  (718)
you sell fish trust ?  (719)
you trust elementary school teacher ?  (720)
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot;  (721)
this is a very smart against asked .  (722)
when you understand what the problem is , what would you say , &quot; well , i believe , some people don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot;  (723)
very rational answer .  (724)
in short , we in real life , we in different ways for trust .  (725)
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the official civil servant , etc . , people will be types .  (726)
for example , i would say i certainly believe a i know the elementary school teachers to teach them how to read . but i don &apos;t believe that she can run bus .  (727)
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers .  (728)
i believe that i love that might drink a friend &apos;s friends chatting . but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them , he &apos;s a secret to living people .  (729)
that &apos;s it .  (730)
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , that &apos;s a distinction 信任感 , so why do polls , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ?  (731)
i think poll was a very bad measure 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea , because it &apos;s good people 抹杀 . poor judgment to consider 信任感 poor judgment .  (732)
second , that &apos;s what &apos;s your purpose ?  (733)
it is we need more 信任感 .  (734)
frankly , i think this is pretty funny .  (735)
i think it &apos;s not the purpose .  (736)
i would say , for people should be trusted more to trust , and not to trust not trusted people .  (737)
in fact , i mean , it was trying not to trust not trusted people .  (738)
for example , who have yourself to earn that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money roll out 麦道 夫 mr. people , i think that one ? how do you say , yeah , yeah , so easy to trust .  (739)
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose .  (740)
wise to trust and foolish to choose not to trust that that &apos;s the purpose .  (741)
so some people say , well , ok , this is not the most important not to trust , but reputation of ?  (742)
that means to determine whether someone in some ways trustworthy .  (743)
i think , to make decisions about the need to think about three things .  (744)
they want to see whether or not ? it allows you to be honest , whether reliable ?  (745)
if we think someone &apos;s allows you to , in his field allows you to be honest , and it &apos;s reliable . we have reason to believe they , because they &apos;re very reliable .  (746)
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them .  (747)
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not with them to help me to send messages , because they forget it .  (748)
i got some very confident friends , they really can do , but i think some of them too confident .  (749)
of course , i &apos;m glad that allows you to my friends were reliable , and not is not very honest .  (750)
maybe one , i &apos;ve never found .  (751)
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation reliability .  (752)
trust is our response .  (753)
reputation of is we need to judge . so of course it &apos;s not easy .  (754)
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions in institutions , whether accountability needs to be a professional level or official demand on these making it easier for us to determine whether a reputation .  (755)
there are many institutions that 逆 response .  (756)
they don &apos;t like them to do things like that .  (757)
and i remember i &apos;m a 助产士 chat , she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 than 接生 a children &apos;s hard to ! &quot;  (758)
in our public life , our institutions lives , we found a lot of questions . the institution in accountability for these rules to protect his reputation as can be trusted by the rules are often see it &apos;s the opposite .  (759)
it allows people to focus their work , like they 助产士 , let them take time to waste in the 填表 . like i just mentioned .  (760)
you actually have that experience .  (761)
about purpose to talk about a lot .  (762)
it &apos;s not easy thing . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , an attitude , here are not talking about it .  (763)
and thirdly , about the task .  (764)
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got a little .  (765)
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust .  (766)
well , we can do it for yourself .  (767)
we can rebuild some their reputation .  (768)
we can try to increase our trust each other .  (769)
but off the what , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from each other .  (770)
you can &apos;t rebuild them for about you .  (771)
you need to make people trying to get you any 家信 .  (772)
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people .  (773)
of course , that means you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally .  (774)
you have to provide useful , according to let them know that you are trustworthy .  (775)
how to do that ?  (776)
actually , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , all institutions , always trying to do it very effective .  (777)
i give you just a simple , for example , marketing .  (778)
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions .  (779)
they take 退货 , i will give or take 退货 . i do is i love color socks .  (780)
that &apos;s good . i trust they . because they make me feel like they are vulnerable .  (781)
i think it &apos;s a 教益 .  (782)
for others , if you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very well be trusted . according to say to yourself , you have confidence .  (783)
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell .  (784)
people are trustworthy is a relationship with people . we can determine when people &apos;s worth , how do you trust .  (785)
thank you .  (786)
john 科林 托克斯 : the movies manhood .  (787)
as the father made me happy , is they like to see the movie .  (788)
i like to share with my kids my movie , when my daughter was four years old , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (789)
the next few months , she was really fascinated .  (790)
her favorite character , of course is 葛琳达 .  (791)
this makes her own to look like the same 仙女 was holding 魔杖 .  (792)
but when you look at the 几遍 later , you see this film is so special .  (793)
now , we live , raise kids , all over to a child a fantastic complex world .  (794)
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot;  (795)
it &apos;s not like that .  (796)
that trend is 40 years later today that the epidemic . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 and a 毛绒绒 guy to mimic the enemy of safeguard to save a girl .  (797)
you know that this is what movie ? ...  (798)
right .  (799)
well , this film , &quot; there are many different 绿野 仙 spaces like &quot; recent years we see all the film in 两三 ways , there &apos;s a huge difference .  (800)
first , the 绿野 仙 spaces , &quot; no violence ingredients .  (801)
it &apos;s actually a nasty , like , for instance .  (802)
but i think if we are tracking 仙 绿野 film , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of the people .  (803)
use your magic slippers to beat bad 巫婆 military . &quot;  (804)
but that &apos;s not like that .  (805)
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; special . it &apos;s shown in the most heroic role , intelligence , even bad guys are women .  (806)
i was in a few years later , with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; together , realizing that point , when it &apos;s a little different .  (807)
and i &apos;ve had a son .  (808)
and three .  (809)
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him look .  (810)
but as a second child , his family to take care of suddenly -- a lot .  (811)
and he also run in , and then the obsessed with it is like a duck are born with the duck mom , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , but he clearly i became obsessed with this .  (812)
i &apos;m curious he liked this film reasons .  (813)
a subject that film out of courage , tenacity and faithful ?  (814)
also , or 卢克 joins the army remove the fact that the government ?  (815)
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot;  (816)
dorothy is how to win ?  (817)
she through with everybody become friends into their leaders .  (818)
and i hope to our children in this environment -- oz -- grew up in the world , not to beat up to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality .  (819)
why do we kid movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ?  (820)
about men &apos;s violence film for women impact , there are many brilliant article analysis , you should look at . write very well .  (821)
a lot to affect boy , i read the article not that much .  (822)
in my own experience , 从莱娅 for the environment are getting experience is not enough to guide me in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; men and women of 混居 . &quot;  (823)
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the last movie , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ?  (824)
i do a mission , winning 芳 heart .  (825)
why are you going to be standing here ?  (826)
i don &apos;t know what to do .  (827)
these films focus on the bad guys get beat the reward , that no matter how much time dealing with other and experience .  (828)
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 .  (829)
of course , also lots of examples why , and i would in front of you for disney princess they defend .  (830)
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not expect these films audience .  (831)
the film is largely a all because that &apos;s how we teach girls against 父权 society , but these movies and no boys to show you how to fight 父权 society .  (832)
kids don &apos;t idol 寻 .  (833)
we also have some incredible women start for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie .  (834)
finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot;  (835)
i tell you all recommend this film . now are being shown in .  (836)
you remember the brave lore &quot; criticism , the first project ?  (837)
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 also beginning to do the movies . &quot;  (838)
that &apos;s good . don &apos;t been .  (839)
now , the movie all by 贝克德 test , &quot; no . &quot;  (840)
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it .  (841)
the test for not known , but today , maybe we can do about them .  (842)
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her and a friend in and they saw the movie about content .  (843)
very simple , only three questions : in the movie is one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ?  (844)
think about the standard .  (845)
if , female characters in movies are talking about ?  (846)
if there &apos;s no conversation , with their common 心上人 talk about content ?  (847)
okay ? thank you .  (848)
thank you very much .  (849)
two women , have to speak , a conversation .  (850)
there was this film . i saw , but we &apos;ve seen in the movies and love is very rare .  (851)
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a good quality of the movie &quot; the 阿尔戈 . &quot;  (852)
oscar the film , work really well , the standard hollywood movie high quality .  (853)
but bell doerr test f .  (854)
i think it should not , because most of the film plot don &apos;t know if you have seen the film , the plot of what &apos;s happening in 人质 has been hijacked big events in 使馆 , men and women are hidden inside .  (855)
we see scene for the men in place to be profound and full of anxiety conversation . and one of the movie actor , the nice story is the next door said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot;  (856)
this is hollywood .  (857)
look at statistics .  (858)
the most popular front 2011 100部 movies , how many film a heroine ?  (859)
11部 . not too bad .  (860)
but just picked congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , that &apos;s good enough .  (861)
and the percentage of just higher and the percentage of you will get shock .  (862)
last year , new york times published a paper done by government .  (863)
here &apos;s content .  (864)
in the united states every five women get one ever met 性骚扰 .  (865)
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s popular entertainment , had the wrong .  (866)

muhammad ali : unemployment between and terrorism .  (890)
i want to tell you a story about a little kid .  (891)
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know the story  (892)
he lived in somalia in a small village  (893)
it &apos;s very 加迪休 village from the capital .  (894)
this little village , because it &apos;s been so drought 食不果腹 poor people .  (895)
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the somali , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities .  (896)
he got there , no , no , no prospects opportunity .  (897)
and just to live in a tent that &apos;s 加迪休 town in the country .  (898)
and the last year , it &apos;s nothing .  (899)
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch .  (900)
he came across a bunch of people have vitality and he got rest .  (901)
he &apos;s got some money can buy new clothes can give their own native to send money .  (902)
they give he introduced a young girl .  (903)
and they did .  (904)
he started a new life .  (905)
he lives have goals .  (906)
in &apos;s 加迪休 one day in the sky 碧蓝 there was a car bombing .  (907)
this is the city of my little boy is the suicide bombers and had to it , dynamic people are &quot; for youth &quot; a party , and al qaeda terrorist organization relationships .  (908)
this little boy just wanted to go through the city why through his story was a suicide attack for the end ?  (909)
he actually wait .  (910)
he was waiting for a chance on his waiting for the future can move a road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road .  (911)
this is going to be like in 成年期 from his first encounter .  (912)
and his story in the world , and over again in different downtown .  (913)
this is a story about power , taken from the urban youth unemployment story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots 成年期 they started to get out of things .  (914)
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means job opportunities , wealth , but people did not enjoy to them in the city .  (915)
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment .  (916)
by 2030 , five people live in cities , which has three under 18 belong to the people .  (917)
if we in urban development , not the young people think , of course , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for 成年期 come across the story of terrorism and violence and gang these 雷池 will be the future of cities .  (918)
i was born in the cities , more 加迪休 70 percent of people in unemployment .  (919)
70 percent didn &apos;t work didn &apos;t read books .  (920)
basically do nothing  (921)
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that i was born in the hospital .  (922)
i remember standing that are full of play eye hospital in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it would be ?  (923)
if i have to get at the same waiting 成年期 ?  (924)
i would be a terrorist ?  (925)
and i did say no answer .  (926)
i came last month &apos;s 加迪休 reason is actually to try an obsession with business leadership summit .  (927)
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership  (928)
we sat down and working together to think about how to solve a city of the biggest problem .  (929)
one of the room called aden young people .  (930)
he &apos;s in the 加迪休 university and graduated .  (931)
there was no job , nothing .  (932)
i remember i told him because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , it was very frustrated party &quot; for youth &quot; ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit .  (933)
the people that look like this .  (934)
but his story , there &apos;s another version  (935)
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , to the biggest obstacle was the  (936)
23 years of civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , actually , it became the easy-to-use tools .  (937)
aden found opportunity and grab on it .  (938)
he built a motorcycle company .  (939)
started a motorcycle cab to the people who couldn &apos;t afford motorcycle  (940)
in 亲朋好友 help , he bought 10辆 he eventually dream is in the next three years to expand 数百辆  (941)
he &apos;s story of how different ?  (942)
what makes the difference ?  (943)
i believe is his and find opportunities to grasp opportunity .  (944)
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is on 成年期 waiting for the most powerful .  (945)
he drove young people as they had been crazy in search of economic opportunity makers  (946)
you can put people into training .  (947)
i want to tell you about a young man who had to me that i have a conference he called doctor-heroes mohamoud is a 名花 businesses .  (948)
he was getting my training in business summit part of the young people how to grow them how to create entrepreneurial innovation .  (949)
if you ask people , &quot; you see the flowers are when ? &quot; born in civil wars period for many of them will be the answer is , &quot; never seen before . &quot;  (950)
so doctor-heroes from that opportunity .  (951)
he started a 园林 greening and design and companies .  (952)
he &apos;s in 加迪休 go out on a agriculture he started to grow and tulip 百合花 and he said that it can make it &apos;s been 加迪休 hostile climate .  (953)
and he started to send it to the wedding 家庭式 garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s the building &apos;s busy 加迪休 22年 to the first park citizens .  (954)
in today &apos;s 加迪休 is no citizens park .  (955)
he wanted to create a space for family , young people together to here , as he said , to feel and enlightenment 花香 rose .  (956)
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water  (957)
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in that room , mohamed for young people here at the very deep .  (958)
they had no idea can entrepreneurship  (959)
they thought for civil society organizations work for government work , but in this case , he innovation to those people very big .  (960)
he makes these young people with the opportunity to reframe the city  (961)
he makes them think they can also be entrepreneurs can also be changing the world .  (962)
and the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now .  (963)
they came up with a business solution to local problems .  (964)
so young people to create corporate culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas .  (965)
they need mentors guidance expertise and development and take them on their business .  (966)
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them from idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for cities  (967)
for me , entrepreneurship is not just business on  (968)
and it involves creating social impact .  (969)
mohamed is not just in sells flowers  (970)
i believe in hope he &apos;s selling .  (971)
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , it will be truly change people to the city .  (972)
side street aden hire him for a cab and help strengthen the motorcycle  (973)
he gave them the opportunity to escape from waiting to escape from 成年期 unfortunate .  (974)
these young entrepreneurs are for their cities have a profound impact .  (975)
so my suggestion is working with more young people become entrepreneurs inward development nurturing their creative spirit , that will have more for peace and park story there rather than the car bomb and waiting 成年期 story .  (976)
thank you .  (977)
薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read the chinese word for !  (978)
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , i remember one of the most precious for my mom &apos;s shows the chinese word for the beauty of form of care .  (979)
since then , i became obsessed with this beautiful language .  (980)
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to china as 高不可攀 wall .  (981)
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how to tackle this wall , for those who want to understand and look at this complex language elegant , where people can do this .  (982)
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way , for the chinese word for learning .  (983)
from five up , i started to learn how to sequence , a right across the chinese word for every one of the book .  (984)
fifteen years time , i learn new the chinese word for every day .  (985)
because we are only five minutes time , should have a much more easy faster way of learning .  (986)
a chinese scholar 二万个 the chinese word for that .  (987)
you just need to recognize the chinese word for a thousand , can read simple literature .  (988)
that &apos;s the chinese word for the top 二百个 , you know -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read and sign to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content .  (989)
today i use the chinese word for eight to show you how this works .  (990)
you ready ?  (991)
put your mouth to a larger , the better , until a square .  (992)
this is a &quot; and &quot; words .  (993)
this is a man was walking .  (994)
&quot; one word . &quot;  (995)
this is a tree .  (996)
&quot; carpenter . &quot;  (997)
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot;  (998)
&quot; day . &quot;  (999)
&quot; months . &quot;  (1000)
&quot; 門 &quot; signs , just like wild about comfort in a couple of cars on the door .  (1001)
i call this eight words for basic words .  (1002)
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words .  (1003)
&quot; a man . &quot;  (1004)
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot;  (1005)
there is a saying that , people from two to three people , for the public .  (1006)
if somebody open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot;  (1007)
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; in this , people were stuck .  (1008)
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about get stuck in the whale belly .  (1009)
a tree . &quot; is &quot; carpenter &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot;  (1010)
three trees together , is &quot; forest . &quot;  (1011)
put a board on the tree , we have &quot; basic . &quot;  (1012)
to put a 张嘴 on a tree , it &apos;s &quot; 呆子 . &quot;  (1013)
remember those very easy , because a will speak trees are very 呆傻 things .  (1014)
remember &quot; fire ? &quot;  (1015)
&quot; fire 两团 &quot; together , it becomes very &quot; hot . &quot;  (1016)
&quot; fire 三团 &quot; together , is &quot; 焱 &quot; fire , very much .  (1017)
to put the fire &apos;s two trees , will &quot; burn &quot; .  (1018)
for us , the sun is all that life come from .  (1019)
two together , the sun is &quot; 昌 &quot; going around .  (1020)
the sun three together , it &apos;s &quot; twinkling lights 亮晶晶 . &quot;  (1021)
when the sun shines , together , and the moon , which is &quot; the light . &quot;  (1022)
one day after a night , is &quot; tomorrow . &quot;  (1023)
from the sun is up on the horizon . &quot; 旦 . &quot;  (1024)
a door to door . &quot; &quot; put in a piece of wood , is &quot; 门闩 . &quot;  (1025)
to put a 张嘴 on the door , is &quot; ask . &quot;  (1026)
&quot; -- boom , boom -- &quot; somebody at home ?  (1027)
this man was even outside , &quot; &quot; 躲闪 , &quot; &quot; escape .  (1028)
the left , we have a woman .  (1029)
two women together , maybe have debate .  (1030)
three women together , be careful , is &quot; and &quot; 姦 .  (1031)
we &apos;ve learned about the chinese word for 30 .  (1032)
and through this way , this basic eight words can secondary up into 32 the chinese word for .  (1033)
the next eight of the chinese word for the offspring , and the chinese word for 32 .  (1034)
so , you can have a really easy to learn hundreds of the chinese word for this is the chinese was eight children of the chinese language .  (1035)
these words in school later , we started to build a phrase .  (1036)
like , &quot; the mountain . &quot; and &quot; fire &quot; together , we have &quot; volcano . &quot; this is &quot; volcano . &quot;  (1037)
we know that japan is the sun rises place .  (1038)
and here the sun and 原点 together , because the japanese 东面 in china .  (1039)
so the sun and 原点 together , is &quot; japanese . &quot;  (1040)
in &quot; the japanese &quot; added a &quot; people , we get what ? &quot;  (1041)
&quot; the japanese . &quot;  (1042)
the words are stacking up and down the mountain , those two together .  (1043)
in the ancient chinese , which means 流亡 , because chinese clothes 政敌 to put in the mountain .  (1044)
nowadays , &quot; in &quot; becomes &quot; go out . &quot;  (1045)
&quot; and &quot; a word that tells you where out , is &quot; exports . &quot;  (1046)
this slide , it reminds me of the talk , and walking down the table . thank you .  (1047)
