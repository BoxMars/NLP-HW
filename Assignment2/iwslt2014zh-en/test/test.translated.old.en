meg jay : why is not new was 20 , 30 years old . 
when i 20几岁 , when i saw my first need mental therapy patient . 
and i was a university in berkeley read the ph clinical psychologist . 3d students . 
she &apos;s a called alex 26 women . 
the first meeting , alex wore jeans and slightly 不修边幅 上衣 , in the directly into my office , sit in on the couch , kick off her shoes , and said to me , she &apos;s going to tell me about men &apos;s question . 
when i heard this , and i disengaged . 
one of my classmates first patient is a 纵火犯 . 
so , i have 一个二十几岁 people want to talk to me to talk about boys . 
i thought i could deal with this thing . 
but i don &apos;t have to do . 
alex in every meeting , all that funny story , so to me 点点 head , and on the results of the time is a very , very easy thing . 
alex would say , &quot; this is a new 20th , &quot; and i know , she &apos;s right . 
in order to have to work , marry later to have , in order to have children , even after death is to have . 
like alex , like i was 二十几岁 people apart from the time , nothing . 
but not too long , i have to just 催 i started to push alex love life . 
i said no . 
and i said , &quot; yes , she &apos;s now on a date , and she &apos;s the same dumb bed , but it doesn &apos;t mean that she would and he married . &quot; 
and i have to say , &quot; it &apos;s not , but she might and the next one of these people getting married . 
furthermore , there &apos;s marriage alex spend your time is the best in before she got married . &quot; 
this is what psychologists call &quot; and it turns out that ! &quot; moment . 
and in that moment , i learned that 30 is not new 二十岁 . 
yes , people than ever later 安顿 off , but that doesn &apos;t mean that alex 二十几岁 between , this is her development 低谷 . 
this makes alex 二十几岁 a development of the good times , and we &apos;re sitting there kill it . 
and i realized that this &quot; kindness oversight , &quot; is a very real problem , and it &apos;s a serious consequence , not just for alex and her love life for people around the 二十几岁 family and the future . 
now , the united states , there are about 5千万 二十几岁 people . 
this is about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you think about that nobody can experience 二十几岁 in this phase of the situation through adult period . 
if you &apos;re 二十几岁 , give you a hand . 
i really wanted to see here , 一些二十几岁 people . 
that &apos;s great ! you &apos;re awesome . 
if you and 二十几岁 people work , if you love 一个二十几岁 people , if you because 二十几岁 people and lost o , i just want to see -- okay . awesome , 二十几岁 people , very important . 
this is not my point of view . that &apos;s true . 
we know that a human lifetime that 80 percent of the most important moment , happened in 35 years old . 
that means that every 10 decided to your life would be the kind of experience with , &quot; it is ! &quot; moment of eight happened in 30 中旬 . 
more than 40 years , you don &apos;t worry . 
i think this audience , no problem . 
we know a career in 10 years ago , and you will make much a pretty big impact . 
we know more than 50 percent of americans 30 before and 终生 mate married , 同居 , or on a date . 
we know that the brain in your 二十几岁 , in order to adapt to the second adult period , it &apos;s the last time into a spike , of course , this suggests that whatever you want to change your own what , now is to change its time . 
we know other than life stages 二十岁 , some of the big change , and we also know that women reproduction in 28 years old , reach the summit , to 35 years old , and that &apos;s a little hard to do . 
so your 二十几岁 this between , is to tell your own body state and the choice of the time . 
so when we say children &apos;s development , we all know , five years ago , is the brain development language and admiration the critical period . 
this is a your daily life will for the future of you have a big impact time period . 
but we &apos;ve heard a few there &apos;s a thing called adult development , and our 二十岁 this stage is adult development of the critical period . 
but it &apos;s not 二十几岁 people heard . 
newspaper in describing the adult 时间表 of change . 
researchers have 二十几岁 called extend adolescence . 
journalist for 二十几岁 people additional stupid names , like , &quot; in the middle , &quot; and &quot; adult children . &quot; 
it &apos;s true . 
as a culture , and we get is actually adult 期中 known as the most important decades doesn &apos;t matter . 
伦纳德 伯恩斯 -- i said , if you want to do a big thing , we need a plan and not enough time . 
it &apos;s not right ? 
so , when you take a 二十几岁 people head and said , &quot; you have extra 10 years to start life , &quot; when you think what &apos;s going to happen ? 
what &apos;s not going to happen . 
you take the individual sense of urgency , and worked , but nothing happening . 
or , &quot; you all that if i just 30 years old , before i started my career , no problem . &quot; this kind of thing . 
but then they start talking about , &quot; my 二十岁 quickly over , but i didn &apos;t have to . 
i graduated from that day , the best 写写 my résumé . &quot; 
and then they start talking about : &quot; 二十几岁 , date as a seat in games . 
you running around , and , having fun with it , but to 30 or so music will stop off , you , one after the other to sit down . 
i don &apos;t want to be the only 一个站 with people , so sometimes i think my husband and i got married , the reason is because in my 30 , he &apos;s from my most recent &quot; chair &quot; . &quot; 
and the 二十几岁 people out there ? 
don &apos;t do this thing . 
well , just that sounds , maybe a little bit 轻浮 , but don &apos;t get me wrong , in this currency , very high . 
when things were pushed to 三十几岁 to do , and when you 30 this phase is in a very short period of time to start a career , pick a city , to find a mate and have a few kids to enormous pressure . 
there &apos;s a lot of the things that are not compatible , and as research to that , in 三十几岁 this stage , and do so many things of stress , and it &apos;s too big . 
in a thousand years later , middle-aged crisis is not going to buy a red open buggy . 
is that our job is not that they want . 
is that you can &apos;t have to get your kids , or can &apos;t give their kids a people . 
i want to change 二十几岁 people do with the best . 
i &apos;m going to tell a story about how to do that . 
this is a story about a name &apos;s emma women story . 
25 years old , emma came to my office , because she , with her , by and large , experiencing an identity crisis . 
she said she thought she wanted to do art , or the entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided a few years ago , so she spent do at the . 
because cheap , she and her that show 脾气 worked more and more than my boyfriend live together . 
and whether she 二十几岁 how hard it is , she had to live more difficult . 
she &apos;s at a meeting , often cry , but said , &quot; you cannot chose your family , but you can choose your friend . &quot; and 平定 down . 
one day , emma walked in , in their lap , and was crying about an hour . 
she bought a new address thin , and she took one morning , fill her to people , but she can only stay for the watching &quot; in an emergency situation , please call ... &quot; and &quot; the back of the space . 
she almost 歇斯底里 of looked at me and said , &quot; if i &apos;m a car accident . who &apos;s going to take care of me ? 
if i had cancer , who &apos;s going to take care of me ? &quot; 
now , i spent a big effort to avoid said , &quot; i will . &quot; 
but emma need is not a very , very concerned about her treatment architect . 
emma need a better life , and i know that this is her opportunity . 
since i &apos;m alex . stuff , and i learned a lot , and i &apos;m not going to make emma that has decided to work 10 years that flow off . 
so in the next weeks and months of that , i told the emma three every 二十几岁 people , both men and women , are supposed to hear things . 
first of all , i told emma forget her identity crisis , and started to accumulate identity capital . 
i said , &quot; accumulate identity capital &quot; meant for your own increase value . 
do you want a for what &apos;s going to be investment . 
i didn &apos;t know emma career , the future , and nobody knew about my job of the future , but i know this : identity capital would get to more identity capital . 
this is take that one multinational career , that one in and you want to try to give that to start of the time . 
i &apos;m not in 漠视 二十几岁 people explore , but i was 漠视 meaningless exploration , and the press it to tell you can &apos;t called exploration . 
it &apos;s called on time . 
my name &apos;s emma trial all kinds of work and get them to count . 
secondly , i told emma city tribes overestimate . 
the new capital , the new can about out of the people almost always from the inside of the circle at . 
new things from what we call the weak to come in , like our friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friends . 
yes , there &apos;s about half the 二十几岁 people never jobs , or not full employment . 
but half of it is not , and that connection is weak , put yourself into that a group of ways . 
half of the new jobs will not be pasted them , and connecting to your neighbor boss is you get the job that was not 张贴 work the way . 
this is not cheating . it &apos;s about information about how to communicate science . 
and finally , emma people don &apos;t choose to believe that a family , but we can choose friends . 
and she grew up , and that &apos;s right , but as 一个二十几岁 people , very quickly emma is going through and somebody 结伴 , creating a family to take her family . 
i told emma choice family time is now . 
you might think , is a more than 20 , 30 , even is 25 , better security , the next time , and i agreed . 
but when you &apos;re on other people started to get married auditorium , and you manage your 同居 or sleep people don &apos;t call progress . 
in &apos;s marriage kung fu up and down the best time is married before , which means would love to be treated as rich work like that . 
choice family is conscious choices that you want to people and things and not just to make things success or and choose your that people waste of time . 
and that emma and how ? 
well , and it turns out that address thin , and she found her an old roommate , a family in another state of an art museum work . 
the weak to help her where a job . 
and that job give her a left her 同居 aisles reasons . 
now , five years past , she &apos;s a museum special activity planners . 
she and a her consciously chose people get married . 
she loved her new career , she in love with his new family , and she gave me a it says , &quot; now emergency 联系人 a fence seems to just not big enough . &quot; 的卡 pieces . 
emma story to this thing that sounds very simple , but that &apos;s what i love and 二十几岁 people working well . 
it &apos;s so easy to help them . 
二十几岁 people like just leave los angeles international airport go somewhere in the west flights . 
and the fly , a little challenging is falls in alaska in fiji , it &apos;s all the difference . 
likewise , at 21 or 25 , and even 29岁 , a good chat , a good break , a good tedtalks can 对接 the next few years , maybe even generations have a very big impact . 
this gives a worth spreading , you know , for every 二十几岁 people thought . 
it and i learned to follow alex saying as simple . 
don &apos;t be that you don &apos;t know about , or didn &apos;t do definition . 
now , you &apos;re in determines your life . 
thank you . 
李镇河 : 李镇河 : into the computer , &quot; really &quot; the world , to your infinite imagination 
all across the computer history , we &apos;ve been trying to bridge between us and digital information 隔阂 , there &apos;s the real world and the gap between the virtual world . in the virtual world , our imagination is infinite . 
it &apos;s a gap is in the fall , and will continue to fall , and now it &apos;s a gap is to less than one millimeter , which is a touchscreen glass that thin , and computers , it &apos;s all the people there . 
but i was thinking , if not virtual and real world of borders between the good ? 
so i started to try this crazy idea . 
i first built out of this tool , it can go digital space , if you take this a pen in force on the screen , and a pen pen and will go into the pixels some of the virtual world . 
designers that can go in a three-dimensional space to their ideas , the surgeon can on the screen for organs inside practice virtual surgery . 
so , this is a tool that broke the virtual and real world of boundaries . 
but we are in the hands out . 
how can we reach into to and digital information to interactions , and use our flexible hands ? 
i was at microsoft 应用科学 lab , and my mentor 卡迪•布兰葛 redesign the computer to a keyboard on top of a space move into the number of jobs . 
because the window and file , the physical space in a particular location , pick and they become like from the shelves take a book , so easily . 
and then you can read this book , and in every floating window and virtual touch board across the words . and sentences . 
architects directly with their hands stretched or rotate all kinds of models . 
in these examples have shown that we &apos;re now entering the digital world . 
but how we can transform it role to get digital information into our world ? 
believe in the room a lot of people have online shopping and 退货 experience . 
but now , you don &apos;t than worry about . 
because i , here &apos;s an augmented version online 试衣间 . 
this is the system , and our body geometric features later , through the loads of or a way to look at that show us the time . 
but , again , i started to think about this idea , how to make our space these visible pixels can pick up a little switch to actually get , feel stuff ? 
this is what the future might look like ? 
at the mit media lab , and i and my mentor 石井裕 and my partner 雷米 de persian , together , make it a &quot; matter pixels points . &quot; 
in this case , a spherical shape 磁体 like we &apos;re in a three-dimensional space pixels points , which means that the computer and people can take the object , move into this little 一三维 three-dimensional space any place . 
we make the basic principles are , the gravity to pellets . and it &apos;s magnetically levitated , the power of technology and goes into a ball together to control movement . 
and for this object figures programming , we &apos;re trying to free time and space constraints of matter , which means , now , people &apos;s movement to the physical world that can be recorded , back and forever , keep . 
so , dance 编排 it can be remote and actually teach , michael jordan , the famous 扣篮 action can over and over and over again , actually being repeated itself . 
students can use it as a tool to learn the complicated concepts like planets movement , physics , and different from a computer screen or textbooks , is this learning process is real , you can touch it , feel it , is to force . 
more exciting , it &apos;s not just the computer is put things into a real stuff , but to think , programming world even going to change our everyday physical activity . 
and as you can see , digital information will not put things that give us , it &apos;s going to start to acts as we become part of our physical environment , not cut our relationship with the real world . 
my talk today is talk about &quot; border from &quot; the start , if we can get the border , the rest is our enormous imagination . 
thank you . 
卜秋静 : the antidote to be books . 
&apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned over two years in china 湖南 体操 . &apos; 70s , i &apos;ve learned in china 湖南 体操 after two years . 
when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 体校 转学 , when i was in elementary school , one grade , the government wanted me to 体校 转学 , all free . 
i &apos;m the killer mother said , &quot; no . &quot; 
my parents , and i hope for the elephants as they are and engineers . my parents , and i hope for the elephants as they are and engineers . 
as 文革 survivor , they get -- think happiness , the only proven way was a security 高薪 work . 
and i liked or not that work doesn &apos;t matter . 
but i dream is to be 黄梅戏 actor . 
that &apos;s my premise playing the piano . 
戏曲 actor to start to learn from small 身段 kung fu , 戏曲 actor to start to learn from small 身段 kung fu , i wanted to do everything 黄梅戏 way to go to school . 
and even wrote to the principal 戏校 with a radio host . 
but don &apos;t have a lot of people like the idea . 
don &apos;t have a big people believe that i &apos;m serious . 
there &apos;s only my 小伙伴 them for me , but they also a child , and i did powerless . 
was 15 , and i know that i &apos;m going to learn how to play has age too big . 
my dream is no longer going to do . 
i worry about the rest of my life , in my life is to get some 二流 happiness . my life is to get some 二流 happiness . 
injustice ah ! my god . 
i decided to dark for themselves , looking for another mission . 
around that no one 赐教 ? no big deal . 
i learned from the book . 
and the 三毛 全集 , &quot; &quot; 南怀瑾 of the history of experience . &quot; i &apos;m in 1995 , to the united states , in the united states , what i first read a book ? 
of course , is that the chinese 禁书 . 
the earth , &quot; talking about china farmers . 
real to be propaganda . okay . 
bible is quite interesting , but it &apos;s odd . 
the topic 他日 and talk about . 
but the ten commandments , the fifth commandments struck me , &quot; you should honor your parents . &quot; 
my heart a move , &quot; glorious , &quot; that &apos;s not and more than &quot; submission . &quot; 
it &apos;s become my climb up 儒家 负罪感 tools , it becomes i climbed out 儒家 负罪感 tool , and i rebuild the relationship with their parents . 
to a new culture and environment , as i compared to read habits , to a new culture and environment , as i compared to read habits . 
it allows people to read more profound . 
for example , you first saw this map , i think it &apos;s some strange , because this is china continent students from little into the use of the world map . 
i had never realized that the chinese don &apos;t necessarily need to in the middle of a world map . 
it turns out that the map , with a view . 
compare reading is not new . 
it &apos;s academia , in the standard approach . 
比较文学 , more religious even become specialized research . 比较文学 , more religious even become specialized research . 
compare and contrast scholars to a project has a full understanding . contrast control let academics have a project has a full understanding . 
and i wonder , now that &apos;s reading on useful , why don &apos;t use it in daily life ? 
so i started putting a book about to read . 
they can be about the same event , different parties , they can be about the same event , different parties , or two a shared experience of my friends . 
jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation , jesus experience is economic , political and mental temptation . 
it &apos;s all buddha experience psychological temptation : desire and fear and social responsibility -- interesting . 
if you understand the language , take your favorite books of two language . but it &apos;s very interesting . 
so thomas 默 . the translator , &quot; and &quot; 庄子 阿伦 watts translation of the moral approaching . people often say , &quot; we always have lost one , i actually found that translation can lead to harvest . 
for example , is to translate that i realized that the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the literal meaning , but it &apos;s called &quot; rapid joy , &quot; well ... 
in &quot; the bride , &quot; a word of the literal meaning , but it &apos;s called &quot; new mom , &quot; oh my god ! 
books have become 今人 communication , and lack of a magic portal , books has become my 今人 and lack of communication , a magic . 
let me just don &apos;t think alone helpless . 
other people &apos;s suffering , than dream 破灭 &apos;s not what other people &apos;s suffering , compared to the dream 破灭 &apos;s not what . 
i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose , i started to realize that dream come true is not the only purpose . 
it &apos;s the most important purpose is that we touch to dream sources of places , passion sources of places , happiness sources of places . 
even a broken 灭 dreams can also make your experiencing that touch . 
because the book , i &apos;m here to here , happy to be alive , and life of purpose and meaning to become clear , in most of the time . 
and hope it will always be with you at any age . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
帕鲁尔 de 塞加尔 : 颂歌 envy . 
i was eight , and in the class new to a woman . she &apos;s compelling , like all new to the girl that . 
she had a lot of the 光泽 秀发 a cute little 文具盒 specialize in the capital that week name on the spell that no one can than 
and that year , i was that the people were envy until i think of the evil . 
one day i dropped out of school , and 逗留 for a moment and left to a night , i &apos;ve been silently sit on the toilet 
and at that time , i &apos;m 出动 go from a classroom teachers get the score for the table . 
and then i conspiracy win by stopping . 
and i change my opponents scores only changed one , which is to put some a wait 降级 . 
well , it &apos;s all a 
when i &apos;m going to put it back 册子 抽屉 , but wait . some of the other students and high to awfully ! 
so , because there was a crazy 错乱 i changed all of the score , but it &apos;s creative . 
i gave all kind of a 3d 等分 and give themselves a line , because i &apos;ve been in this , more to do something completely 
now i don &apos;t understand my behavior . 
i don &apos;t understand this idea is where , coming out . 
i don &apos;t understand why do when they &apos;re very good 
i was feel great . 
i don &apos;t know why i had never been found 
i mean , this thing to do so . 
i hasn &apos;t been found . 
but it &apos;s important is , why i care about this girl , that are tiny little girls so good at spell ? this has been threw me . 
envy threw me 
it &apos;s so mysterious , everywhere . 
we know that babies are jealous of torture 
also know that a primate envy , blue 知更鸟 very likely to envy 
we know that &apos;s the murder agents spouse . 
but i never read an research could explain , &quot; envy &quot; lonely , it &apos;s a long time , or the brutal . 
in order to understand it , we had to see novel because fiction is a laboratory to study &quot; envy , &quot; what &apos;s possible . 
well , i don &apos;t know it &apos;s not hyperbole : if we don &apos;t envy , we &apos;re going to have a literary ? 
if not 忠 ocean &apos;s , there is no &quot; odyssey . &quot; 
no where 妒忌 king , there is no &quot; 一千零一夜 . &quot; 
don &apos;t have shakespeare 
we all have read 书单 high school , because we &apos;re losing the 喧嚣 with a was lost . &quot; &quot; the great gates than &quot; is the sun rises , &quot; are losing the 包法利 lady , &quot; &quot; anna 卡列琳 her . &quot; 
don &apos;t envy , there is no 普鲁斯 . now , i mean , i know that people always say , love 普鲁斯 what all know , but the envy of this thing he did it . 
this is his 巨著 &quot; 追忆 with water 年华 &quot; 一百周年 this piece is about as well , it &apos;s the research that we can think of the common 竞争性 , which is that i was . 
when we think about 普鲁斯 , we will think about the emotional details , right ? 
we want to a small boy is 入梦 
think about a 玛德琳 in 薰 衣草茶 of cake . 
we don &apos;t remember him how sharp eye . 
he &apos;s so cold , no compassion 
the books in virginia , 伍尔夫 seems like a cat gut . 
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the cat , but we can suppose it 坚 as 顽石 . 
if we look at these things , how come together to be so 合拍 . fiction and envy , envy and 普鲁斯 , 
妒忌 comes down to people , desire , from a so strong form of the narrative foundation is not very obvious ? 
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s a lot to push our sensitive nerve because just think about when we get jealous , what happens . 
when we get jealous , and we &apos;ll make a story . 
tell a story about his people living in these stories make us feel bad because they were just to make the we &apos;d suffered . 
we tell ourselves as stories , and the audience know exactly where to join the details where to plug in lethal 一刀 . right ? 
envy , and we all become amateur novelist , and that 普鲁斯 , can understand . 
all she did what i &apos;m happy thing will give people happy , maybe now that &apos;s going on ? &quot; 
and that &apos;s what he started to their crochet story , and then , 普鲁斯 portraits , the million every that he lover of a new glamour is he &quot; sexual 虐 密室 together in a series of tools . &quot; 
now we have to admit , 斯万 and 普鲁斯 , two people &apos;s hearts infamous . 
you know , 普鲁斯 of my boyfriend , are you going to tell him 分手 that had to escape from this country . 
but you don &apos;t need so jealous will admit it &apos;s not easy , right ? 
and you &apos;re 疲 jealous body 
it &apos;s a 饥渴 emotions , have to get . 
envy like this ? 
envy love information . 
like detail . 
like a big put 光泽 秀发 cute 文具盒 . 
envy like . 
it &apos;s also instagram that fire . 
普鲁斯 , it will academic language with envy 相联 language . 
when the million struggle in his jealous of a sudden he started standing in front 偷听 to bribe the officer lover servants &apos; quarters of his defense for the behavior . 
he said , &quot; look , i know you think that annoying , but it and interpret a 古文 , or watching a memorial no two . &quot; 
he said , &quot; these are the science of research , there &apos;s really the knowledge of value . &quot; 
shame , grief , loss : these are 普林斯 , to wisdom . 
he said , &quot; we need a woman , a let our pain woman has given us all emotional than , let &apos;s interested in a genius , can have more profound and lethal . &quot; 
he was telling us to find cruel woman ? 
no . i think he &apos;s envy , let &apos;s see what themselves . 
there &apos;s no other emotional can in this particular way that we find ourselves ? 
other emotional will not to let us see their hostility , their ugly trying to heart and what they deserve ? 
other emotional can teach us so unique and better looking at the world ? 
freud shortly after that , he wrote that . 
one day , a 心神不宁 youth visit freud this young think his wife disobedience . he &apos;s so 憔悴 ours 
freud think this guy &apos;s kind of weird , because he doesn &apos;t really concerned with his wife do . 
because his wife was innocent , you all know . 
this poor guys just 缘由 , no doubt . 
but he was looking for his wife of some of the unconscious , is utter intend move . 
she &apos;s not funny too 灿烂 . or , she was really mindlessly meet the man ? 
freud said this man is turning into his wife unconscious behaviors guard . 
fiction writing about this very well . 
it &apos;s very , very good at novel about how we look at the training pitch , but it &apos;s not a gets it right . 
well , we get jealous , the more intense , we &apos;re going to the more often . 
so i think that &apos;s not tempt us to do something , or violence illegal . 
envy causes us behavior becomes so extreme 
i admit , i think about eight years old , ourselves , but i also think about this , on the news to see a story . 
michigan 一个52岁 women were discovered register a fake facebook account and used to account for their year sending out the malicious news . 
a year . for one year . 
she &apos;s trying to 陷害 her before he girlfriend . now i have to admit , when i heard this , i like to look up to her . 
because , i want to say that , you face reality . 
how creative ! just with the wrong place , right ? 
this comes from fiction . 
a pie 翠西亚 de 海史密斯 fiction 
海史密斯 is one that i love writers . 
she &apos;s in the united states 文学史 brilliant and 诡 one page . 
for example , tom in her case , but perhaps the most famous . 
里普利 started to you or want what you have , then you want to be , and have you ever have you locked in a basement he 应答 with your name wear your ring spend your bank account . 
this is a road . 
but how do we do ? we can &apos;t be repeated 里普利 . 
i can &apos;t tell the world with big change , even though i would one day be able to do this . 
and unfortunately , because we live in admire times . 
we live in envy . 
i mean , we are social media good citizens , and there &apos;s a trend , isn &apos;t it ? 
fiction can give us the solution ? i &apos;m not sure 
so we &apos;re going to 学学 fictional characters , and see where they met puzzles , the thing and don &apos;t know how to do . 
let &apos;s go back to the b 贝克街 221 ask 夏洛克 de 福尔摩斯 
when people think about 福尔摩斯 would want to his opponent 里亚蒂 professor -- this crime genius 
but i &apos;ve always liked to a police station 探雷 斯垂德 阴险 face scottish a 头子 he really needed 福尔摩斯 to his intelligence , but to hate him . 
oh , i don &apos;t have to know about this . 
he &apos;s 雷斯 垂 need help , and to hate him in the case of mysterious 侦破 , always and 苦闷 story 
we proud of you . &quot; 
it said , in scotland . nobody &apos;s willing to and 福尔摩斯 hold hands . 
this is what we see 少数几次 福尔摩斯 in human development , was moved , and i was very moved by this object is very mysterious isn &apos;t it ? 
it seems to envy as a geometric problem , instead of emotions . 
this one minute , 福尔摩斯 standing 雷斯 垂 de opposite 
the next minute they stand in the same . 
suddenly , 雷斯 垂 de allow ourselves to admire that he had hate . 
but what &apos;s so simple ? 
if envy is really a geometric problem to do , a story about how we choose relationships with other people in the position of the problem ? 
and at that point , we &apos;re not going to hate someone talent . 
we &apos;ll try to get 
but i love contingency plan . 
so when we &apos;re waiting for that moment when it comes to remember , we have as 慰藉 fiction 
it has been going on with envy fiction 
fiction to envy domesticate it to please the kitchen table 
look at it and who are called to : cute 雷斯 垂 de , terrible tom 里普利 crazy , millions , there &apos;s 马塞尔 de 普鲁斯 there . 
we have so good . 
thank you . 
ar de 内格尔 : i was in new york garbage of discovery . 
i was 10 or so , once and dad went up to that camp 阿第伦 mountain . that &apos;s a in the new york in the wild zone . 
that is very good . 
the forest searched twinkling lights . 
shine sunlight , when from the leaves , like 晶莹 of colored glass , and if there &apos;s no feet small way , we can actually pretend that we were first at this piece of the human . 
we eventually got to our camp . 
that &apos;s a on a cliff camp , to look at one of the 水晶 晶莹 beautiful lakes . and then i actually found a bad thing . 
and in a camp behind , there &apos;s a for about 40 feet 见方 a garbage heap . there &apos;s a bad apple nuclear , used some aluminum foil paper , and poor sneakers . 
i was very surprising , very angry , and very , very confusing . 
to camp people just too lazy , even themselves in the garbage are not ken up . they think , who can clean 善后 for them ? 
the problem has been baffling to me . it was a longer sound bite . 
who &apos;s going to clean up we leave the garbage ? 
but you can take this problem on anything you live in a place . 伊斯坦 clean we leave the garbage ? 
in rio cleaned we leave the garbage ? in paris and london ? 
in new york , here , is we leave the sanitation trucks were parked department cleaned up to 11 , 000吨 trash and every 2000吨 &apos;s recycling waste . 
personally , i want to understand the sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
i want to know who are doing this work . 
in sanitation trucks were parked on up in a sense of responsibility for what ? 
so i started a about sanitation trucks were parked workers research project . 
i was sitting in the car , and along the track , on all the new york at the office and work with the sanitation trucks were parked people . i learned a lot , but i still is a 局外人 . 
i need a deeper understanding . 
so i really got the sanitation trucks were parked workers work . 
now i &apos;m not just sitting 垃圾车 in , and i &apos;m driving 垃圾车 . 
i myself and the electric 扫帚 its street , on the road 铲 snow . 
it &apos;s an extraordinary privilege , and it &apos;s 令人叹服 education process . 
everybody &apos;s going to ask the smell . 
there &apos;s a smell , but it &apos;s not you think that bad . sometimes odor is really bad . but you &apos;ll soon will adapt . 
the weight , it takes a long time to adapt . 
i know that even though there are a few years working side of worker , their bodies have adapted to try and in a week megatons of garbage . 
so there is at risk . 
with the labor 统计局 report , sanitation trucks were parked work is the most dangerous , one of the 10 major tasks . i later and figure out why . 
you all day on the road , and in traffic , yet . 
out of the cars , thinking only over you , and people often not enough to be careful . 
the sanitation trucks were parked workers , for me , it was so bad . 
and what the itself is poisoning , these 毒物 often from 垃圾车 comes out , in a terrible harm . 
i also learned the brutal and frightening . 
when you &apos;re walking down the 路沿 , in sanitation trucks were parked car to look at a city , you have time to recognize the really like the power of nature itself . 
it never is 源源而来 . 
it &apos;s like breath , or the cycle of one form . 
it &apos;s always in motion . 
and finally , called the oriental sanitation trucks were parked by it . 
i think it &apos;s called the oriental . to funny , because i believe that sanitation trucks were parked workers is the city streets , the most important workforce . three reasons . 
they are public health 第一道 barriers . 
if a day they don &apos;t efficient quickly cleaned the words , the from in containers bring , it will actually poison in a very real way threats to our lives . 
we over a decade , century 和数 attacked disease , again , there would be to threaten our health . 
国民经济 need sanitation trucks were parked workers . 
if we don &apos;t throw away the old stuff , and we would have no space with something new . so , if the economic engine would 停歇 , because people consume less . 
i don &apos;t use capitalism , i &apos;m here is just point out their relationship . 
and the third reason -- that &apos;s what i call our average and necessary , 经常性 activity speed . 
i mean , in today &apos;s in and days , we are so used to 奔忙 . 
we often don &apos;t care , fix , clean , would carry our coffee cups , shopping bag and water bottle . 
we use them , and throw it away , and then they forget about them , because we know that there &apos;s a work in teams were sitting over there put these things is densest . 
so today i want to suggest that you to think about the sanitation trucks were parked workers situation , maybe help that they &apos;re called . and they brought to talk about how to build a sustainable people , the city . 
i think their work is a noble . 
and every time to individual hard to work in the street . 
in many cities , they &apos;re wearing sanitation trucks were parked suit of work . 
you know , they would be on time to clean up garbage . 
they allow us to secure in their work . 
they almost became secure work promise . 
they &apos;re doing is going to keep ourselves safe without 忧 , and we don &apos;t have to worry about the rest of the 糟粕 and junk . this work traffic anyway -- to keep stability . 
september 11th , 2001 , the next day , i &apos;m listening to the sanitation trucks were parked trucks 咆哮 and to , i pulled the young sons ran downstairs . there &apos;s a recycled paper workers are doing his week 三都 do work . 
i want to thank him do these work in that particular days , but i just cry up . 
he looked at me , just 点点 head , and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be alright . 
we &apos;ll be alright . &quot; 
and i just started studying sanitation trucks were parked on work , and again , i met this guy . 
his name was 保利 , we had a working together , you become friends . 
i want to believe that 保利 , right . 
we &apos;ll be alright . 
but we , as part of this planet , we need to work very hard to rebuild . we have to think about all the consumption , including very real labor consumption . 
the city , that we know of garbage actually only about three percent of all the garbage . 
this is an amazing data . 
so , in your life every day , in your life of the river , next time you see somebody and you leave out the garbage , please find a time to their 致意 . 
find a time to say thank you .

okay , open your eyes . 
i &apos;m going to talk to you about a year , spring in new york are going to have the unexpected . 
it &apos;s called the memory 冠军赛 
a few years ago , as a 科技类 journalist to the competition with this thought about there to be like geeks who &quot; super bowl 冠军赛 . &quot; bustling . 
a bunch of 屈指可数 men and women grew up in some old boy is still not aware of personal health 
just look at some 奋力 in a situation that the hundreds of any list numbers . 
some are trying to remember populations of strangers . 
they want to within a few minutes trying to put the poetry . 
and in the game , who is the fastest way to remember the 一整副 打乱 card order . 
i was like , that &apos;s amazing . 
these people surely gift , unlike 禀 
so i started interviewing 参赛者 
this is called ed cook &apos;s from england , he was there to get the best training . 
i asked him , &quot; ed what you are , started to realize that they are memory genius ? &quot; 
ed said , &quot; i don &apos;t mean anything . 
and my memory was . 
to this every single person will tell you their memory is just generally . 
when i was , &quot; whoa , what i &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot; 
we stood outside the hall smart 过人 amazing and a little bit weird british ed said to me , &quot; josh you &apos;re an american journalist . 
you know , britney 小甜甜 ? &quot; 
i 茫然不解 , &quot; what ? of course , why would you want to ask this ? &quot; 
&quot; because i really wanted to in the u.s. national radio taught britney on how to remember 一整副 打乱 card order . 
you can prove that this is that everyone can do . &quot; 
and i said , &quot; look , i &apos;m not britney , but you can also to teach me ! 
we had to find a teaching people , why not ? &quot; 
and then a very peculiar way 序幕 out in front of me . 
and the second year i spent most of the time in the training their memory and study memory . i want to try to understand that memory of the reasons why sometimes think again about and other hidden exactly what the potential . 
en route i met a lot of fun . 
one is called e. p . 
he suffers amnesia his memory was probably the world &apos;s worst . 
his memory capacity to even worse don &apos;t remember myself have amnesia really amazing . 
and he &apos;s a tragedy , but through his character , we can understand that memory in any way , shape our personality 
in the other side is i met somebody like this . 
his name is kim peek 
he &apos;s dustin hoffman in the movie &quot; the rain man &quot; characters in . 
he and i took one afternoon in salt lake city public library back phone books , and i think is just fascinating 
and i went back home and i read a lot about memory article written in the paper 两千多年 ago in latin wrote from ancient until then , during the middle ages 
and i learned a lot of really interesting things . 
one is used to train illegal beam culture memory of this idea that didn &apos;t look like today . 
曾几何时 send it to people in your memories could 不遗余力 to your mind . 
these technologies for modern life possible , but also change us . 
not only in the culture , i think , and also in cognitive . 
kids don &apos;t need to remember , sometimes think we &apos;ve forget how to memory . 
in this piece of the earth has very few places that makes you think people still interested in training illegal beam culture memory . it &apos;s an extraordinary memory . 
it &apos;s not that extraordinary around the world are starting to do this . 
for which i was fascinated with these people want to know how to do it . 
a few years ago london university school of a team of researchers asked to a contest to study memory . 
they want to figure out the human brain , we do to others in anatomically structure different ? 
the answer is no . 
and then they than we are smart ? 
they gave subjects to deliver a cognitive test still had to deny . 
but compared with the goal is to control the brain of the memory up there are brain actually had a very interesting different was that problem . 
these people were sent to do functional mri scan the brain when they &apos;re memory number or 人脸 or kind pattern , researchers found that memory up , there are brain activate areas with ordinary people don &apos;t . 
notice that they think , is in the brain in space , memory and navigation when they used to . 
why ? what can we figure out what kind of thing ? 
竞争性 memory 较量 by a game like the way toward the 白热化 every year , someone with more effective way of memory show 赛场 and other people have to catch up 
this is my friend ben pridmore win three times the memory there . 
in his 台前 have 三十六副 打乱 sequence card he was going to be in an hour , laying down . it &apos;s a he actually invented , they were just he would . 
and it &apos;s similar to the way he had a word , not bad back down 4140个 any one of binary . only half an hour . 
a cow . 
参赛者 in the competition of using a lot of different memories of different ways to be applied to all the skills and can be going into a conceptual psychologists call a delicate code . &quot; 
this idea to use a humor paradox perfect interpret called baker / baker paradox simple to say is that i have two people to remember one word i tell you , &quot; remember , a guy called baker . &quot; 
baker &apos;s people . 
and then i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; remember somebody &apos;s baker . &quot; 
and over time , i &apos;m back to find you ask , &quot; remember what i call you remember before the word ? &quot; 
&quot; remember what word ? &quot; 
they were told 人名 is baker people remember that term potential away , not as being told a baker of that man . 
the same word cause different memories . 
what is , why ? 
because 人名 baker no special . 
can &apos;t tell you a head little complicated memory make any . 
but baker , as a usual terms , we all know the baker &apos;s . 
baker with funny white cap . 
they hand and flour . 
they came home from work with a toast 扑鼻 . 
maybe some people have a friend &apos;s baker 
we first hear this word , when you &apos;re going to produce all kinds of ways that allow us to after a while , can still remember . 
and this precise memory 两千五百年 skills in front of the ancient greeks have . 
and then call it memory palace 
developed this technique . this is a called simonides the poet that he was going to go to a dinner party 
in fact , he &apos;s been asked to do the performing guest , because in that cool in the fancy party . it &apos;s not just d. j. to play reduction , but to please poet ode to . 
he stood up and put out of his 全篇 诗作 and 潇洒 leaving , he just walk outside dinner party hall is on the come down on all sorts of people died . 
not only all deaths , all of them are going to come down on 面目全非 
nobody says that have to tell them all , some people say , who didn &apos;t have to tell who sat where 
that causes the body can &apos;t get the right place 殉葬 
and then this reinforce the whole thing tragedy colors . 
simonides standing outside and as the rubble only survivors close your eyes , had suddenly awakened to realize that in his mind in front of him up all 宾客 are sitting . 
he was hold the hand relative to the site , and they take it around . 
simonides was thrust upon 醒悟 things that we all have to guess . it &apos;s no matter how much we are not remember name phone number or a colleague of every word command , we all have very keen visual or space memory . 
if i give you 逐字逐句 to recap i &apos;ve been talking about simonides story of the first 10 words should not many people will remember . 
but i bet , if i give you now back down on your the foyer . sat will speak brown 骏马 on who you understood that i mean . 
this advice from the latin 两千多年 before the first memory scholars 
so this phrase works , what is this ? 
if you were invited to stand on the ted stage here at the center of the talk , and you want to do as 脱稿 西塞罗 in 2000 years ago in rome . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt; the talk , and he would be so 霸气 go one , and you want . 
you have to do is to imagine yourself standing on their front 
and then working imagine a completely crazy memorable with what used to remind you come up to mention the first thing is that it was creepy naked ride . 
and then you go into the house of sweet pastry monster ed mr. sitting on the back . 
this picture will remind you want to introduce your friends ed cook 
and then you head comes 小甜甜 britney looks like , you go back to that story about britney little story . 
and then you go into the kitchen , you have to say to the fourth topic is that you spent a year through the amazing journey through 绿野 仙 tracking can association 
this is going home talk rome reciting 稿 secret is not a bad word . not just reciting would just flat 添麻烦 but remember , one by one . 
that phrase , &quot; the theme : &quot; is from the greek word &quot; topos &quot; means &quot; place . &quot; 
this is 古时候 people talk about talk or a rhetorical when they use in space . 
&quot; the phrase &quot; means that your memory through the 第一层 
it &apos;s a really interesting . i know this up a lot of interest . 
and then i went to more memory . 
i started 萌发 a more detailed it that the memory of my culture . 
but there &apos;s a problem . 
the problem is that memory up , and it &apos;s very boring . 
it &apos;s like a group of people sitting there 高考 . 
very exciting moment , don &apos;t have is someone 揉 揉 small source . 
i &apos;m a journalist had a bit writing ! 
i know that these people in my head is certainly 惊涛骇浪 , but i can &apos;t see as 外人 
and i realized that if i really want to report that you have to have that experience . 
so i started to try to every morning , sat down and look at new york times before for 20 minutes 十五 to try and memory something . 
there &apos;s my little poem . 
back in 跳蚤市场 back and i bought 年鉴 old people in the names . 
i was surprised to find that it &apos;s actually very 带劲 
you &apos;re not trying to simply surprise 
what &apos;s interesting is that actually goal is not going to train of memory 
but you &apos;re trying to improve the creative imagination in your mind working to create the completely comical myth 胡乱 can do is memorable . 
and it became my fun . 
this is what i &apos;m wearing standard competition memory , training suit . 
it &apos;s a 耳塞 a 护目镜 镜面 all hot black left two little holes , because the memory , the biggest enemies are attention distributed 
and again , i went back to a year ago , the story of 竞 赛场 . 
i also want to urge is signed up for that as engagement properties news experiment . 
and i thought that it can , in the 前言 调侃 about himself . 
the question is , experiment that got the unexpected consequences 
i won the competition , it &apos;s exactly what i expect . 
for me now talk back 稿 phone number or shopping , one is a piece of cake , it &apos;s great , but in fact , these are not important . 
these are little usual tricks 
the usual tricks that memory works is because they 依仗 human brain some basic principles . 
don &apos;t have to really build memory palace or remember the order of the 几副 cards and you can actually from understanding brains work in get some benefits . 
we always 议论 memory good people always think that somebody &apos;s gift , unlike 禀 as it is not . 
powerful memory is can acquire . 
from the fundamental with 专心致志 can remember 
engaged , it can remember 
memory palace , or that memory skills are just 捷径 . 
and in the end , they can &apos;t be 捷径 
this work is because it forces you to think about 
it forces you to go deeper , to want to give you more focus most people would not be cumbersome to the training 
actually 捷径 didn &apos;t really exist . 
this is what we have to remember things . 
by having experiences that i found that our bodies 潜藏 with an amazing memory . 
but if you want to live memorable is to do that , remember , a lot of people . 
thank you . 
who la lee duke 沃斯 : success willpower keys ? 
on my 27th , and i left a very challenging career -- business management counseling , turn it into a more challenging professional : education . 
i came to new york , some of the public school taught seven grade math . 
and other teachers , as i &apos;m going to give students do little test and test . 
i &apos;ll give them all placed homework . 
when these 试卷 and homework open up , and then i calculate their grades . 
i was struck by the iq , the ups and i was not the best and the worst students between the only difference . 
some in the 课业 did quite well students don &apos;t have very high iq score on . 
some very smart kids , in the 课业 are not so 尽如人意 . 
this got me thinking . 
and of course , the students in seven grade need to learn things that are harder , like rates , little count , parallel 四边形 area of computing . 
but the idea is that it can be doing , i believe that every one of my students can learn textbook content , as long as they would spend time and effort . 
and after a few years teaching , and i came to the conclusion that we , in terms of education , what &apos;s needed is learning from the perspective and psychological level , the students and learning . take a more profound understanding . 
in education systems , we all know , evaluating students , which is the best iq , but if you &apos;re in school , and the good life do away , not just dependent on you learn to ease effective ? 
all i left the stage , back to school and entered psychology master &apos;s degree . 
i started studying kids and adults are , in all sorts of very challenging circumstances , and the instruments , work , my question is , who &apos;s successful , and why they succeed ? 
and i and my research group to point out 西点 research . 
we try to predict what little fellow to be elected to have to live military training , which will be eliminated zone out . 
before we went to see the national together words that competition , and also try to anticipate what kids can level-up to the end of the game . 
we look at work in hostile environment work , just go in teacher , ask them what their teachers to be in the end of the academic year to stay 任教 , and they those who can increase the speed of the kids to school . 
we work with 私企 , they sell to ask what people can stay in . 
what can earn the most ? 
in all these different context , a character , no one out of that , which was largely predicted success . 
and it &apos;s not social intelligence . 
it &apos;s not beautiful appearance , robust . , it &apos;s not very high iq . 
it &apos;s willpower . 
tenacity is for the long-term goal passion and carry on . 
tenacity is to have perpetual 恒 something happened . 
tenacity is you for the future , every day on , is not just for a week or a month , but a few decades trying to struggle to make their dream a reality . 
tenacity is put life as a marathon . and it &apos;s not a sprint . 
a few years ago , in the public school , i started to research that willpower . 
i said to the 千名 初中生 conducted about willpower the survey , and waiting for more than a year , to look at the end , what can graduate students . 
all is not just in 西点 point , or put in the words that the race to willpower . in school is also true , especially about the dropout 徘徊 on the edge of the kids . 
for my own self , about willpower me the most incredible things is heading for willpower . we cognitive , to develop willpower , the science to understand that was how poor . 
every day have parents and teachers to ask me , &quot; how do i do to develop willpower children ? 
what to do , to teach kids to really work ethic ? 
and how can mobilize their long-term is motivation ? &quot; 
frankly , i don &apos;t know . 
i know is , brilliance isn &apos;t allow you to gritty heart . 
our data suggests that very clearly , there are many , many brilliant people , they can &apos;t keep 兑现 their commitment . 
in fact , according to our data rates , tenacity , usually with other factors that has nothing to do , even with the brilliance of measures run counter . 
so far , i &apos;ve heard about the kids grow tough qualities , the most effective called &quot; growth model for thinking . &quot; 
stanford 卡洛杜 william , with a view , and he believed that the human learning can change , it as your level and to change . 
杜威克 professor means , when kids reading and learning about the brain of knowledge , and it facing challenges , what was happening and grew up , what they fail , more likely to get on with it , because they don &apos;t believe that have been lost forever . 
so , growing sexual mindset 大有裨益 to develop willpower . 
but we need more . 
i decided at the end of my comments , because we &apos;re going through it . 
this is the elephant in the face of work . 
we &apos;re going to take out the best ideas and the most strong intuitions , we &apos;re going to do that . 
we need to measure whether it &apos;s success and failure to right and wrong , from the failure to benefit from experience in again and again . 
in other words , we only have their own to become more have willpower make our kids to become more have willpower . 
thank you . 
泽维尔 de dimensions that the : into local culture . 
and as an architect , i &apos;m designing buildings , will also think about , building and around the environment , , and building and around the environment , the tradition of the relationship between . 
now , today , i &apos;m going to share with you two based on the idea of cases . 
these two examples are in the emerging countries , one in ethiopia , another in tunisia . 
one of these cases have in common is that design solutions , and shape the process , from multiple different perspective on architecture , what constitutes a design solutions important components . 
the first case origins and i was invited to the capital for ethiopia 亚的斯亚贝巴 design a new 多层 shopping mall . 
this was my team and i get the same example , we were asked to design into this way . 
i first saw this feeling is , i really don &apos;t want to do . 
looking at the same this kind of building the later -- the city , a lot of this kind of building -- we &apos;ve discovered the architecture of the most important three questions . 
first of all , the building is basically empty , because they there are some of the largest store , people are not the big brands . 
the second question is , they need a lot of energy to tune in temperature , because architecture outside the roads are glass , the design to heat trapped in a building inside , and so we need a lot of refrigeration . 
this is not supposed to happen in the city , because the city of the climate is very 宜人 , throughout the year in the temperature stable 25度 左右. . 
the third problem is the building looks a little bit of a relationship with africa or ethiopia didn &apos;t . 
for a cultural 底蕴 and abundance of the city , it &apos;s called people down . 
and , in my first expedition ethiopia , and i was a local 集贸市场 was mesmerized . . every day , hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the outside environment , from 小商贩 in all sorts of want to buy products . 
this with my idea is the same , is that the outdoor public setting create all kinds of activity that idea . 
so i thought , this is what i want to design , forget the shopping center . 
but the problem is , how can we in such a contemporary 多层 in architecture 贯彻 these ideas ? 
the second challenge is , when we started designing , this is a rapid development of cities in the photo , you see a lot of buildings , and we design , doesn &apos;t exist . 
and this building on the before and after two parallel street , in the later 几百米 don &apos;t have a little can connected . 
so we need to do is to use our the buildings all of a portal , put these two road linked it up . 
and then we have a gradient of 庭 design , create an open architecture space , and this design by its own shape to avoid the pedestrian by 日晒雨淋 . 
around these empty space , we sort out a lot of little store , based on our little marketplace idea . and every floor of the store that are used as a different shape and not the same . 
i think , the question is , the buildings outside walls , how do you paint ? 
and i really want to be able to find a patterns , to design for the local environment . 
and i started thinking about a texture structure , using a hole made out of cement , to be able to use a controlled by the way , to the light and air to go into the building . 
we went from ethiopia women beautiful traditional dress patterns in get inspiration . 
these patterns , contains a geometry of the texture piece , i &apos;m going to these questions were filled with the outside walls . 
we were outside walls &apos;s using these little 预制 material , these windows to let the air and light , where we control of the way into the building . 
in order to do this point , we use these little 有色 glass buildings , use the light source , at night , with the architecture . 
but our these ideas , at the beginning , not touch building , and their response , sort of , &quot; no , this is not the mall . it &apos;s not what we want . &quot; 
but then we all recognize , the design solutions than traditional mall for more to earn money , because this design solutions to sell shop number more . 
and this outside walls design , reduced lots and lots of cost , it &apos;s not just because of this 预制 material cheaper than glass , and because we don &apos;t need to use a lot of air conditioning to control the temperature . 
and eventually , we also save a part of the budget . 
builds stage of the first question is , think about how to make sure that building in power to the question is , because in cities , almost every day to pull 闸 pushing the electricity . 
so we were on the roof on a lot of solar panels . 
and then we thought , you can on the roof , in the solar panels here , put some 桌椅 to break , let it be in cities , 小憩 oasis for people . 
on the roof of these 游廊 , was to use to collect rain , to the interior of clean . 
we &apos;ve built to 第五层 , we &apos;re in the next year , beginning as well . 
the second example for the tunisian town planning a over 2000套 an apartment and collateral infrastructure architecture . 
do this big scale project , this is what i did , the largest project , i need not just very deep sense of tunisia this city , and she also need to understand all kinds of tradition and culture . 
in the analysis of the process , i kind of being a arabs 聚居区 attract , this is a has over thousands of years of history structure , brick wall structure , there are 12 相互之间 through the door , almost a straight path connected . 
when i started in graph paper planning , what we did the first thing is to get around the streets of big areas , to cut 12 primary small region in size and all the characteristics , similar to what we in barcelona and other european cities , the common blocks planning . 
in these blocks planning basis , any mentioned idea , we chose a few key points , to bring these key points connected by a straight line , changes in the beginning of the model . 
the last step is to think about specific region of the design of the building , apartment these kind of a cubicle , is made of the big plan , the fundamental components . 
that &apos;s when i was thinking , for a in the mediterranean climate apartment , what kind of them is the best ? 
and the answer is 南北朝 to , you can use house 南北 on either side of the temperature difference , created a natural 穿堂风 effect . 
so we do this kind of model , and all the apartments all have the perfect towards . 
this is what we design with , like a together , the city schools in europe housing style of together . 
some of the building , there &apos;s a garden , and walk around on the ground sidewalks to complete connection . 
and she &apos;s meet the needs of the local management agency , 上层建筑 of the population density high , the population density is not very expensive . 
and she &apos;s for us to have a portal between 通性 asked . 
the roofs are this project i &apos;m most 得意 part , it &apos;s like to be these buildings takes up space to gave community . 
the community , you can climb roof , each other and poke somebody talk about god , or make some sport , like in the morning , on the roof run a 两公里 , or in the back and forth between jump . 
these two examples , there &apos;s something in common , in the design process with the same way . 
again , they &apos;re all in the city , you can literally see buildings little 拔地而起 . 
in these cities , architecture for people affected , whether the present and future for the local community and the economic impact , to build a building at the same speed . 
for this reason , i think about the architectural design in between , the more and more important , which is , looking for a simple and enough cheap solution , to increase and promote the local people , and civic relationship , and to make people good close to nature . 
thank you very much . 
onora o &apos;neill : we trust me . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to talk about today is trust . at first , i &apos;m going to tell you said that , people to trust the basic idea . 
i think these ideas are very repeats itself so often , in the real social has become a cliche . 
i think there are three things like that . 
one is proposition : 信任感 has a lot to reduce . this is a widespread consensus . 
the second is purpose , we should have more 信任感 . 
and the third is task , we should rebuild 信任感 . 
i think people to this proposition , purpose and task has the wrong way . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you is with this proposition , purpose and task a different perspective . i want you to better understand trust . 
the first is proposition : why people think 信任感 in down ? 
if i &apos;m now have evidence based on the thinking about , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the answer . 
i tend to think 信任感 does have down , but that is that in some movement , or in some institutions in . and in other ways , maybe it &apos;s increasing . 
i couldn &apos;t 一概而论 . 
but of course , i can look at polls , poll should be thought 信任感 in decline out there . 
but when you really look at different times polls , it &apos;s not many evidence supporting this idea . 
so , in the last 20 years ago , which are not believe in people &apos;s mostly press and politicians , still wouldn &apos;t be trusted . 
and 20 years ago is highly trust people , for example , the judge and the nurse , still get altitude of trust . 
the rest is 居中 . and by the way , in social 居中 on these people , it &apos;s completely 居中 . 
but the evidence 说得过去 ? 
poll record , of course , is that some people view . 
or poll can record ? 
but that &apos;s some common attitude . you ask them what , they &apos;re talking about . 
you trust politicians ? trust teacher ? 
if someone asked you , &quot; you trust vegetables business ? &quot; 
you trust sell fish ? 
you trust elementary school teacher ? 
you might ask , &quot; trust them to do ? &quot; 
this is a very smart the ask . 
when you understand that question , what is , you would say , &quot; well , i believe , some people , don &apos;t believe that other people . &quot; 
a very rational answer . 
in short , in our real life , we &apos;re in a different way for trust . 
we don &apos;t 信任感 level to do that . we &apos;re going to certain types specific analysis . the civil servant , official , things like people , to be kind of this . 
for example , i would say , i certainly believe that a i know about elementary school teachers to teach students how to read . but i don &apos;t believe that she can the bus . 
and finally , i know she really is a bad drivers . 
i might believe me , and that love is a drink friends to friends , but i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s not what keeps them to live , he &apos;s a secret . 
that &apos;s it . 
in day-to-day life , we have this evidence , say , there &apos;s a distinction 信任感 , so why do polls , we all 糊涂 , to think more conceptual 信任感 ? 
i think poll is a very bad measure 信任感 whether there &apos;s an idea . because it 抹杀 people good , poor judgment . to think about 信任感 poor judgment . 
second , the purpose is what &apos;s the thing ? 
it was , we need more 信任感 . 
frankly , i think that it was funny . 
it &apos;s not that i think that purpose . 
i would say , they deserve to be trusted more to trust . it &apos;s not to trust not trusted people . 
in fact , i mean , it was trying not to trust not trusted people . 
for example , who put their savings that something that looks like it &apos;s like them all the money to roll out 麦道 夫 mr. people , i think , who &apos;s , what do i mean by that , right , so easy to trust . 
too much to trust is not a very smart purpose . 
wise to trust and smart to choose not to trust that that &apos;s the purpose . 
so some people say , well , ok , this isn &apos;t just say the most important is not going to trust , but reputation of ? 
that is to judge other people in some ways , are trustworthy . 
i think , to make decisions about the need to think about three things . 
to see if they ? it allows you to be honest , whether reliable ? 
if we think of a person is allows you to , in his own area is allows you to , and it &apos;s honest reliable . we have reason to believe in them , because they &apos;re very reliable . 
but the other way around , if they don &apos;t reliable , that we can &apos;t trust them . 
i have some honest reliable friends , but i believe it or not , and they went to help me to send messages , because they &apos;re forget . 
i got some very confident friends , they were able to do , but i think some of them too confident . 
and of course , i &apos;m happy , my friends were allows you to reliable , and it &apos;s not really not honest . 
maybe there is , i &apos;ve never found . 
we need is : trust , before going to look at his reputation reliability . 
trust is our response . 
reputation of is we need to judge . so , of course it &apos;s not easy to do . 
over several decades , we &apos;re trying to create all kinds of institutions in accountability for institutions , whether or not to be a professional level or official . and so on and making it easier for us to determine if there &apos;s credibility . 
there are many institutions that 逆 response . 
they don &apos;t like they have to do things like that . 
and i remember , and i &apos;m a 助产士 talk , and she said , &quot; you see , the question now is what i &apos;m going to do a 手续 than 接生 a children &apos;s hard to ! &quot; 
in our public life , our institutions lives , we find a lot of questions . the institution in accountability for rules that can save their reputation can as be trusted by the rules are often see , it &apos;s the opposite . 
and this allows people to focus on their own work , like 助产士 them , and they take time to waste in 填表 . it &apos;s like i just mentioned . 
you actually have that experience . 
about purpose to talk about lots and lots of . 
it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s judgment , is rapidly response , are attitude , there are about not finished . 
and third , about the task . 
the task called rebuild 信任感 . it &apos;s got the . 
this task suggesting you and i &apos;m going to restore trust . 
well , we can do it for yourself . 
we can rebuild some their reputation . 
we can try to increase our trust each other . 
but off the what , trust is unique . because it &apos;s from each other . 
you can &apos;t fix people for about you . 
you need to do with trying to make people 家信 let you . 
i mean , you &apos;re going to be a trusted people . 
and of course , which means that you can &apos;t always fool shelter in some , generally . 
you have to provide useful , based on , let them know that you are trustworthy . 
how to do that ? 
and every day , in a different place , ordinary people , office workers , institutions are trying to do , it really work . 
i give you just a simple business home marketing examples . 
there is a store said i was able to buy socks come back , they never ask any questions . 
they take 退货 , i will take 退货 . or give me the change is my favorite color socks . 
and that &apos;s good . i trust them , because they make me feel that they are vulnerable . 
i think it &apos;s a 教益 . 
if for the people , you make yourself in vulnerable , this is a very good trustworthy an idea . say to yourself , you have confidence . 
so eventually what our intentions are not so hard to tell . 
people are trustworthy is a man and one of the relationship between . we can tell people what is worth , how do you trust . 
thank you . 
the 科林 de 托克斯 : the film manhood . 
and the father and make me happy , is able to see themselves to the movies . 
i love with my kids to share my movie , when my daughter was four years old , together , we saw the 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
and then a few months , she was really fascinated . 
her favorite character , of course , is 葛琳达 . 
and she put their dressed like 仙女 as was holding 魔杖 . 
but when you look at the 几遍 after that , you see this film is so special . 
now , we live , raise kids , are getting immersed in a children &apos;s fantastic a complicated world . 
but the 绿野 仙 tracking 独树一帜 . &quot; 
it doesn &apos;t belong to that one . 
that trend is 40 years later today that the popular . it &apos;s interesting is , another film and it has an iron 大个儿 and a 毛绒绒 guy to mimic the enemy of the guards , they &apos;ve got to save a girl . 
you know , that &apos;s what the movie ? ... 
right . 
this film , well , there &apos;s a lot of different , &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; as we see in recent years , all the film 两三 ways , there &apos;s a huge difference . 
first of all , the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; no violence ingredients . 
the monkey &apos;s inside of violence , like , for instance . 
but i think if we &apos;re taking the 绿野 仙 tracking , &quot; 巫师 would say , &quot; dorothy , you &apos;re saving oz makes predictions of the people . 
use your magic slippers to beat bad 巫婆 military . &quot; 
but , it &apos;s not like that . 
&quot; 绿野 仙 tracking &quot; special . it &apos;s shown in most of the heroic role , intelligence , even bad people are women . 
i was in a few years later , together with my daughter watching &quot; star wars &quot; when i realized that this little , that it &apos;s a little different . 
and i &apos;ve had a son . 
it was three . 
he was too small , so we didn &apos;t call him look . 
but as a home for a second child , his watch it &apos;s sort of a lot . 
and he also run in , and then the mystery . it &apos;s like a duck are born with duck mother again , i don &apos;t think he read this movie here , but he clearly i became obsessed with this . 
i &apos;m curious he likes this film reasons . 
is it out of the theme of courage and tenacity and faithful ? 
also , or 卢克 joins the army , about overthrowing a government that ? 
contrast 一下1939年 &quot; 绿野 仙 tracking . &quot; 
dorothy is how to win ? 
she through with everybody to be a good friend into their leaders . 
and i hope to their children in this environment -- oz world -- growing up , and it &apos;s not up to play to the world -- the world , it &apos;s a very close to reality . 
why do we show kids movies have so much less violent and so the yellow brick way ? 
about men &apos;s violence film for women &apos;s impact , there &apos;s a lot of good analysis article , you should look at . write very well . 
the atmosphere for boys impact , i read the article , not that much . 
that &apos;s my own experience for me , 从莱娅 princess are environment get experience is not enough to guide me in real life to get kids into adult world adult world is &quot; men and women 混居 of &quot; . 
i think the first kiss on the screen should happen in the film in the end , it has to be 演员表 up , because this is the end of the movie , right ? 
i did a mission , winning 芳 heart . 
why are you going to be standing here ? 
i don &apos;t really know what to do . 
these films focus on the beat the bad guys get reward , that no matter how much time dealing with other and experience . 
basically , if you &apos;re a boy you &apos;re a 呆笨 animals , if you &apos;re a girl , you should be wearing 战袍 . 
and of course , the example is a lot , and i would in front of you for disney princess are defense . 
but these movies for boys feeling is they &apos;re not these films expected audience . 
these films , there &apos;s a lot of a all because that &apos;s how we teach girls against 父权 society , but these movies , not to boys showing how to fight 父权 society . 
kids can &apos;t idol 寻 . 
we also have some incredible women start for our children to write a new story , including like 赫敏 and kevin 特里斯 this mental image role , but it &apos;s a war movie . 
and finally , many of you all know , this year they finally introduced the brave lore . &quot; 
i &apos;m going to all of you recommend this film . it was being shown in . 
you remember the brave legends , &quot; just project , the criticism ? 
&quot; oh , don &apos;t believe 皮克斯 also beginning to do the movies . &quot; 
and that &apos;s good . don &apos;t been . 
now , these films , almost all not by &quot; 贝克德 , test . &quot; 
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it . 
the test for people who don &apos;t know , but today , maybe we can do about them . 
alison de 贝克 德尔 is a comic author , in the mid- &apos; 80s , , and she remembers recorded her , and a friend in and they saw the movie about content . 
very simple , only three questions : the movies , if there &apos;s one that &apos;s the role of women and have to speak ? 
think about the standard . 
and if that &apos;s , these women role in the film is talking about ? 
if you talk , there &apos;s no with their common 心上人 talk about it ? 
okay ? thank you . 
thank you very much . 
two women , have to speak , there &apos;s talk . 
there was this film . i saw , but in that we saw , and like the film is very rare . 
in fact , this week , i &apos;ve seen a mass nice movie 阿尔戈 . &quot; 
oscar for the movie , work really well , the standard hollywood movie high quality . 
but bell doerr test f . 
i don &apos;t think that should be , because the movie of the most plot don &apos;t know if you look at a movie , no , that most of what &apos;s happening in plot 人质 has been hijacked events of the big 使馆 period , men and women are hidden inside . 
we see for scene , the men in to be in deep and full of anxiety conversation . and the movies , a woman actor , the nice story is the next door , and said , &quot; sleep ? , honey ? &quot; 
this is hollywood . 
look at statistics . 
in 2011 , before the most popular 100部 movies , how many film , there &apos;s heroine ? 
11部 . not too bad . 
just universal picked congressman women parliamentarians in terms of scale , and that proportion is good . 
and that &apos;s more than just to -- and that &apos;s going to make in this room shock . 
last year , new york times published a by the government to report . 
here &apos;s the content . 
the united states every five women in a woman who had met 性骚扰 . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s in entertainment , had it right . 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s for children that movie . 
i even think porn music and movie with this is not just relationships , but something is wrong . and when i hear the statistics , i was thinking about is the number of 性骚扰 , actually , it &apos;s so much . 
who were they ? what do they were teaching out ? 
they leave school ? 
they have don &apos;t have to understand the film plot , a man hero beat 残暴 反派 and get the glory and reward -- that &apos;s a without friends and not speak woman ? 
we have to learn from the story of what ? 
you know , as a have raised daughter obligation father , and i tell you all the parents with people , for the statistics and the world exist 危机感 , we &apos;re going to be prevent them . 
i mean , i think netflix queue could be very , very important in a way , i was mainly about my father said . 
i think we should be for our boys to show you a new manhood . 
now the manhood definition had putting the cart before the horse . 
you already know the new economy environment is changing women , men &apos;s support his family home 胡口 role . 
they are becoming by alternative . 
when i asked my daughter favorite star wars &quot; in which characters , you know , she said , who ? 
欧 than -- wangari 
欧 than -- wangari cohen , the than and 葛琳 as 
they have something in common ? 
maybe like beautiful dress , no matter . 
i think they &apos;re all experts . 
two people in their own movies than others have more knowledge with others , and willing to share their knowledge , to help people understand potential . 
now , they &apos;re leaders . 
i want my daughter to have this kind of pursuit , we hope to my son with this pursuit . 
i hope that the pursuit of more is better . 
thank you . 
muhammad ali : unemployment and terrorism , the relationship between 
i want to tell you a story about a little kid . 
i don &apos;t know his name , but i know the story 
he lived in the south , a small village . 
this village from the capital &apos;s 加迪休 very close 
this little village , because of dry , so it &apos;s been 食不果腹 poor people . 
stay there was no way , so he went to 大城市 in this case , the somali , the capital &apos;s 加迪休 , which is the big cities . 
he got to , no opportunity , no , no prospects . 
and finally , just to live in a tent town in the country &apos;s 加迪休 . 
about a year in the past , and there &apos;s nothing . 
one day , he met a 贵人 贵人 took him to eat dinner and breakfast and lunch . 
he came across a bunch of very dynamic people , and he got a rest . 
and he &apos;s got some money can buy new to their clothes , can make your own native to send money . 
they give him introduced a young girl . 
and they did . 
he started a new life . 
his life , and there &apos;s a target . 
in &apos;s 加迪休 one day in 碧蓝 sky down there was a car bombing . 
this is the city of my little boy is the suicide bombers and had to it , dynamic people &apos;s &quot; the party , &quot; a and al qaeda had the terrorist organization . 
this little boy just wanted to go through the city through why he &apos;s story in a suicide attack for the end ? 
he actually wait . 
he &apos;s waiting for a chance on his waiting for the future of waiting for a can move road , and that &apos;s his first encounter road . 
this is going to be like 成年期 him from waiting for the first encounter . 
and his story , and over again in the world in a different downtown . 
this is a story about taken from the power of the city , unemployed young story . they &apos;re john 尼斯 堡 launch riots in london riots , they started to get 成年期 out of things . 
for young people , cities have hope 大城市 dream , which means that job opportunities , wealth , but people did not enjoy , and they live in cities . 
more , is that somehow the young people in the unemployment . 
in 2030 , five live in cities , people , there &apos;s three belong to 18 these people . 
if we in urban development , not to think about amazing young people , if we don &apos;t giving them opportunities , waiting for 成年期 come across this story terrorism and violence and gang these 雷池 is going to be the future of cities . 
i was born into cities , more 加迪休 70 percent of people in unemployment . 
70 percent didn &apos;t work didn &apos;t read books . 
basically do nothing 
last month , i went one &apos;s 加迪休 and then i met with 玛迪娜 hospital that home , i was born in the hospital . 
i remember standing that are full of play eye hospital in front of me , i think if i don &apos;t leave it would be like ? 
if i get to in the same waiting for 成年期 ? 
i &apos;m going to be a terrorist ? 
the answer i did say no 
last month , i went back to &apos;s 加迪休 reasons , which is to have a young leadership and entrepreneurship learn summit 
i brought about 90 somalia to leadership 
we sat down and working together to think about how to deal with cities are the biggest problem . 
and one of the room called aden young people . 
he &apos;s 加迪休 at the university and graduated . 
there was no job , nothing . 
and i remember , he told me , because he &apos;s college graduates didn &apos;t work , frustrated about that sort of &quot; the party , &quot; the ideal date , and other terrorist organization want to recruit . 
the people that look like this . 
but the story , it &apos;s another version 
in &apos;s 加迪休 , from a to b , and the biggest obstacle was the 
23 years of the civil war , the road systems to completely destroyed , and now , actually , it became the easy-to-use tools . 
aden found opportunity and on to catch it . 
he built a motorcycle company . 
started cab motorcycle rent to the people who couldn &apos;t afford motorbikes . 
in 亲朋好友 help , and he bought 10辆 he finally dream is in the next three years spread 数百辆 
he &apos;s story about how different ? 
what makes the difference ? 
i believe , is he found opportunity and good grasp opportunity . 
this is what entrepreneurship and i believe entrepreneurship is about 成年期 waiting for the most powerful . 
he to inspire the young people as they had been crazy in search of economic opportunity makers 
you can put young training into entrepreneurs . 
i want to tell you about a young man , he had to me that i have a meeting , he called mohamed mohamoud is a 名花 business . 
he was getting my training in business summit part of the young people train them how to create entrepreneurial innovation . 
if you ask people , &quot; you see what &apos;s the flowers , ? &quot; for a lot of was born in civil wars period of their answer would be , &quot; never seen before . &quot; 
so mohamed from that opportunity . 
he started a 园林 greening and and design companies . 
he &apos;s out in 加迪休 go in a piece of agriculture , and he started to grow tulip and 百合花 , and he said that it can make it &apos;s been 加迪休 harsh climate 
and he started to send a wedding in building 家庭式 garden in the town business too busy . now he &apos;s busy in the building &apos;s 加迪休 22年 for the first citizens park . 
now , there &apos;s no citizens in &apos;s 加迪休 park . 
he wanted to create a space for family young people together , to here , as he said , to feel rose 花香 and enlightenment . 
by the way down , he &apos;s not growing , because they need a lot of water 
so the first step is to inspire the young people so in that room , mohamed attend to all the young people very deep . 
they don &apos;t want to business . 
they thought for civil society organizations work work for government , but in this case , he of innovation , for those people very big . 
he makes those young people with the opportunity to reframe the city 
he makes them that they can also be entrepreneurs can also be changing the world . 
that &apos;s the end of the day before , and they came up with novel solutions to the city of the most tricky issues right now . 
they want out of business with a solution to local problems . 
so that young people creating companies culture is big step across but young people need money to make their ideas . 
they need to expertise and mentor guide lead them and turned on their business . 
for young people with the resources they need to give them support , to help them on the idea to create change you is equivalent to create a catalyst for cities 
for me , entrepreneurship is not just turned on business 
and it involves creating social impact . 
mohamed is not just in sells flowers 
i believe in hope and he &apos;s selling . 
his name is peace park , he took when it &apos;s the building , it will be truly change people to the city . 
aden hire on the side of the street kid to help him cab and help keep the motorcycle 
he gave them the opportunity to escape from to escape from the unfortunate 成年期 wait . 
these young entrepreneurs , all of them have a profound impact on the city . 
so my suggestion is that move more young people to be entrepreneurs . they inward development of innovation , then you have more flowers and peace park story . it &apos;s not the car bomb and wait for 成年期 story . 
thank you . 
薛晓岚 : easy to learn to read the chinese word for . 
i grew up in taiwan . as a 书法家 daughter , me the most precious memory , one of the mother , as i showed the chinese word for the care about the beauty of . 
since then , i became obsessed with this wonderful language . 
but for 门外汉 , for the chinese word for it to the wall as 高不可攀 . 
the last few years , i &apos;ve been thinking about how to be able to tackle this wall , for those who want to understand and look at this complex language elegant , where people can do this . 
i started thinking , how to create a new , fast way , to learn the chinese word for . 
from five up , i started to learn how to the right order , a one crossing of writing , and the chinese word for . 
fifteen years time , i everyday learning new the chinese word for . 
because we are only five minutes time , should have a much more easy faster way of learning . 
a chinese scholar 二万个 the chinese word for that . 
you just have to know a thousand the chinese word for , you can read simple literature . 
that 二百个 the chinese word for the top , and you see it -- 40 percent of the basic literature enough to read sign , to understand chinese restaurant menus , the basic idea or newspaper content . 
and i &apos;m here today with the chinese word for eight to show you how this works . 
you ready ? 
put your mouth is to get bigger , the better , until a square . 
this is a &quot; and &quot; words .

&quot; one &quot; words . 
this is a tree . 
&quot; carpenter . &quot; 
this is a &quot; mountain . &quot; 
&quot; day . &quot; 
&quot; months . &quot; 
&quot; 門 &quot; signs , just like wild about comfort in cars on a door . 
i call this eight words for basic words . 
they are a bunch of components , to create a lot of other words . 
the &quot; man . &quot; 
if another person walks in the back , which means &quot; follow . &quot; 
there is a saying that , two people to get from , three people for public . 
if there &apos;s a guy open arms , the man said , &quot; it &apos;s that big . &quot; 
the &quot; man &quot; on &quot; and &quot; in , the people who were stuck . 
and he becomes &quot; prison &quot; 徒 , like about get stuck in the whale belly . 
tree is &quot; carpenter . &quot; &apos;s two trees together , is &quot; trees . &quot;
